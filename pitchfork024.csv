Around the House,Matthew Herbert,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0bec0084474cd0c3225/1:1/w_160/7fa3b9b6.gif,2002-03-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3835-around-the-house/,PhonographyPhonography,"England's Matthew Herbert is known more for his musical process than his actual output. His work is guided by his ""Contract for the Composition of Music"" manifesto, a kind of Dogma 95-style treatise on music-making in the information age. Herbert frowns on sampling other music, synthesizer pre-sets, and drum machines, and gives the thumbs-up to human error (his 2000 mix CD is titled Let's All Make Mistakes). His self-imposed limitations have driven him to include a certain amount of acoustic instrumentation, including his own accomplished piano work, while pointing him toward unusual sound sources for his rhythmic sequencing. On 2001's overlooked gem Bodily Functions, he borrowed some of the sound sources Matmos used on A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure, made his own recordings of organic phenomena, and incorporated the lot into subtle, elegant pop music that alternated between effortless house tracks and vaguely loungy acoustic jazz. When I first heard Bodily Functions I almost couldn't believe how good it was, but when I looked to others to share my enthusiasm, the responses were decidedly mixed. Some heard genius in the album; others failed to connect with Herbert at all, while still others praised his earlier Around the House album as vastly superior. As fate would have it, Around the House, originally released in 1998, has now been reissued. If Bodily Functions had some stylistic parallels with Matmos' A Chance to Cut, Around the House is more closely aligned with the San Francisco duo's Quasi Objects. As on that early Matmos effort, Herbert integrated the sounds of objects in and around his home into his songs. The comparisons should really stop there, though, because Herbert's musical goals are completely different. Herbert is a song man bent on crafting relaxed, tasteful and ultimately very danceable tunes, and his use of the field recordings differs sharply. Unlike Matmos, Herbert has no respect for the integrity of the sources and shows little interest in using the original context as a reference point. The effect of whatever esoteric sampling methods are used are essentially inaudible on Around the House, but what emerges loud and clear is another exceptional and creative album. As on the later Bodily Functions, the songs on Around the House are voiced by the sultry Dani Siciliano. She sings on just under half the tracks, and the rest consist of either instrumental house numbers (still rife with vocal samples) or moodier, more experimental pieces. The album's highlight comes early in the form of ""So Now..."", its first real track after a short bit of ambient foolery. Even after hearing it 30 times or more in the last week, this song has me hitting the ""back"" button like a Skinnerian pigeon aching for a food pellet. It has a lush and spacious rhythmic backdrop, comprised of little more than a clicking pseudo-snare, a house thump and a simple, round bassline. But the vocals are what make it special. The call-and-response interplay between Siciliano's lead and the breathy backup singers is gorgeous, the kind of music I imagine Prince composing after God finally calls the Purple One 2 Heaven. Almost as accomplished is the sunny, uptempo ""Going Round,"" which alludes just slightly to the jazz fixation that would flower on Bodily Functions. Even more instructive for these comparisons is ""The Last Beat,"" which appears in different forms on both albums. As is typical of the differences between the two records, the version here is a bit more electronic and focused on ambience-- the full-on torch song approach that marks the most recent record was more of a flicker at this stage. In lieu of gently brushed cymbals, the song gives a percussive shape to a tangle of static. A handful of brilliant tracks stand out on the remainder of the album, from light, warm and just-plain-beautiful instrumental house (""Close to Me,"" ""We Still Have (The Music)"") to gurgling ambient tracks thick with nuanced sound design and brilliant arrangements (""We Go Wrong""), to tracks that morph from one mode into the next (""This Time""). I would not personally rate Around the House quite as high as Bodily Functions, but this could well be a matter of which record I heard first. Herbert was a bit more focused on sound than song on this record, but the overall approach is not markedly different. Both albums are loaded with music of exceptionally high quality.","England's Matthew Herbert is known more for his musical process than his actual output. His work is guided by ...

Big Group Hug,Saso,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3585e6ef95969320619/1:1/w_160/00e9161d.jpg,2002-03-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7001-big-group-hug/,Melted Snow,"Man, do I hate Sammy Sosa.

I hate his damn fool ""I love baseball! I'm friends with everybody!"" locker room interviews. And I still hate Sammy Sosa, even now that he's surprisingly begun making strange slow-core records on his home computer. With all his millions of dollars, you would think he could afford some better... [squinting] hey, wait a second, this says Saso, not Sosa. Damn this dyslexia! Well, I don't know nothing about this Saso, but the name conjures images of a Chris Kattan-like male stripper, if you say it with enough flash. The liner notes don't help any, as it's unclear whether the Saso entity is a group (""instrumentation and arrangements by Saso""), or the solitary project of one man (""music/noises and words by Jim Lawler"") and his budget-class recording equipment. The Saso website is no help, either, consisting mainly of not-very-original modem-crashing Shockwave design. Even a Google search failed me, providing only the name of Saso Janfuski, a ""chorus"" performer on some Pink Floyd tribute album from 2000. The music on Big Group Hug is just as mystifying, since Saso himself/itself doesn't appear to know what the hell he/it is. The opening title track is a washed-out canvas of melancholy pop with Yorkeishly high vocals floating over a soft bed of simple acoustic guitar, keyboards, and lightly tapped drums. But the second track, ""Bird Brain,"" is a lengthy and stagnant instrumental that, at one point, head-scratchingly throws in a ""Seinfeld"" sample. And ""Blood Bath"" switches gears again, with diet Neu!. What gives? One clue to Saso's identity may lie in the sonic continuity between the album's ten songs-- namely, the mid-fi bedroom-recluse feel. Most instruments are recorded as if from under a pillow, with the tone uniformly fuzzy and warm like a Rhodes electric piano. Songs are usually left sparse: ""Dimwit"" and ""All My Life"" appear drumless, while ""Dripfeed"" contains little more than piano and voice. But one could argue that things are left overly scanty, as the majority of the album breezes by without leaving any debris lodged in my memory. The instrumental tracks generally don't do enough to justify their existence, and the melodramatic vocals on ""Somebody"" aren't much of an improvement. Occasionally, however, this Saso produces some ear-catching sounds, like the Vespertine music box opening of ""My Brain Hurts,"" and the unexpected stomp in the middle of ""Lazy Bones."" Too bad these elements aren't packaged into actual songs instead of coming across as a series of portfolio pieces for somebody's potential producer(s)/bandmate(s). Looking for that woody, organic, intimate Microphones sound, but can't afford Phil Elvrum? Call Saso! He or They is cheap! Unless, of course, Saso really is Sosa.

Cover Magazine,Giant Sand,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf1eeb335119a49ed185/1:1/w_160/0b1994ee.jpg,2002-03-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3444-cover-magazine/,Thrill Jockey,"Howe Gelb wants you to know that he's too fucking cool. As he starts to sing Marty Robbins' ""El Paso,"" his voice barely lifts above a whisper; the acoustic guitar strums lightly, poignantly behind him. You sense that drummer Joe Convertino is wearing a suit, and that it looks really sharp. The melodrama of this gunfighter ballad comes through, but suavely, and even when Gelb stops in the middle to shred through Neil Young's ""Out on the Weekend,"" it still sounds bad-ass. Giant Sand is Howe Gelb's one-man-band, plus guests. Operating out of Tucson, Arizona, Giant Sand has been performing original material since the mid-80s that loosely sits in the camps of rock and alt-country. Their latest album, Cover Magazine, is a cover album of classic (and kitschy) country and rock songs. This kind of record is usually dismissed as a second-tier project-- just like live albums, and for basically the same reason: going in, you're not expecting a major, original statement. It's true that Gelb never sounds like he's breaking a sweat here, but there's invention and heart in these tunes, and the range is impressive-- stretching from Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash to P.J. Harvey and Goldfrapp. The biggest selling point here is the cover of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man,"" which Gelb reworks into a conga-padded lounge number. His understated and dead serious vocals make the lyrics sound extra bizarre (""Heavy boots of lead/ Fill his victims full of dread""), and the hook is catchy on piano. The second most entertaining cover is Sonny and Cher's ""The Beat Goes On,"" his take on which seems particularly ""knowing."" This version is slicker and has a better rhythm than the original, thanks largely to Joe Burns' bass; Gelb's wife Sofia-- dig the parallel?-- adds wry backup vocals. Gelb tackles most of the instruments himself, but he's joined by some impressive guests. On X's ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline"" his guitar goes from a tense quiet to a blaring fury, and P.J. Harvey sings on the chorus, her wail dripping with blood. Gelb also covers one of Harvey's songs, a bluesy performance of ""Plants and Rags""; the untreated electric guitar sounds like it was recorded out in the garage. Most of the songs use the rhythm section of Burns on upright bass and Convertino on drums, and they're terrific: Burns' bassline on ""King of the Road"" is big and easy-going on this only mildly down-and-out version of the classic. Although the performance of Johnny Cash's ""I'm Leaving Now (Adios)"" is too casual-- this is the only song where the vocals drop from impromptu to half-assed-- Burns and Convertino still sound like they rolled right out of Sun Studio. The last two numbers (not counting a silly reprise of ""The Beat Goes On"") are live recordings with members of Grandaddy. These tunes cover more familiar territory for Gelb: former Giant Sand member Rainer Ptacek's ""The Inner Flame,"" and an expanded version of Gelb's ""Blue Marble Girl"" that's sprawling and gorgeous, riding on his keyboards and Jim Fairchild's massive guitar. Cover Magazine is a diverse album that holds together well. The sound quality is solid, and some of the recordings have a vast atmosphere, particularly that dead-of-night desert setting for ""El Paso."" The record never escapes being a ""cover album,"" mainly because Gelb takes most of the songs so easily. But the point of the album seems to be to let him play entertainer-- from the raw but theatrical ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline"" to that piano line on ""Iron Man"" that'll be stuck in your head for days. Not bad for what could as easily have been just another throwaway vanity release.","Howe Gelb wants you to know that he's too fucking cool. As he starts to sing Marty Robbins' ""El ...

A Feather in the Engine,David Kilgour,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb93eb335119a49eca80/1:1/w_160/2b8c5fde.jpg,2002-03-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4421-a-feather-in-the-engine/,Merge,"There are a lot of ways that music can be beautiful. A lot of times, we hear something as pretty simply because we're conditioned that way. Frequently, beauty and grandeur are the result of careful planning and composing, like Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" or Vivaldi's summer violin concerto. I suppose there are certain cliches that have emerged in Western music as it's gradually become codified into a system of keys and chords and standard arrangements that we've collectively come to view as ""ugly"" and ""beautiful."" The way we listen to music is defined by our cultural surroundings, and our surroundings tell us that minor keys are sad and major keys are happy (generally speaking). On the other end of the spectrum, there's a different kind of beauty to found in less strictly composed, more free-flowing music. You can hear it in Shuggie Otis' ""Freedom Flight"" or the first track on Boredoms' Vision Creation Newsun. There's a certain point where some improvised music suddenly ceases to be subject to pretense-- it's just there and you take it for what it is. On a personal level, I think this is why I find listening to Japanese koto music and Javanese gamelan orchestras to be somewhat liberating. Somewhere in all that sound, you can catch a rather vivid glimpse of the soul of the person or people playing it. Naturally, I enjoy both music that's intricately composed and music that's totally free of any compositional guidance. A Feather in the Engine, David Kilgour's fourth solo album (excluding his mid-90s compilation of demos, First Steps and False Alarms), plays something like a meeting point between the two ends of the spectrum. On the one hand, you have several smartly written psychedelic pop songs, ensconced in the traditions of Kiwi rock that Kilgour's own band, the Clean, helped establish. On the other, you have a handful of simply gorgeous off-the-cuff guitar instrumentals that transcend any other little subgenre distinctions you could apply to Kilgour's music. The album opens with one of these instrumentals, a meandering, meditative track called ""Sept. '98"" that makes me want to get out a good throw rug, find a mantra and have a good moment of escape from my oft-overbearing superego. Kilgour's guitar lines seem to flow with his stream of consciousness, and the several overdubbed parts combine for a shimmer effect. An unassuming organ interjects now and then with quasi-melodic phrases that provide a good contrast to the simple themes Kilgour works out on his guitar. One urgently strummed passage even recalls Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic Journey"" from Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow. The album moves from there to the quirky pastoral psych-pop of ""Slippery Slide,"" full of tumbling piano flourishes, percussive, plucked bass, and relaxed acoustic strumming. Kilgour's singing isn't exactly what you'd call world-class, but his subdued tenor works just about perfectly for this kind of thing. ""All the Rest"" follows with a more focused pop hook and a strong backbeat. Kilgour doesn't pay much mind to traditional pop song structure in his writing, though, and this songs is no exception, as he lays into his wah pedal for an extended midsection that provides the record with one of its Clean-est moments. Several other songs follow fairly well-paved paths, such as the fine acoustic ""The Perfect Watch"" or ""Wooden Shed,"" but the three best songs come consecutively near the end. ""Today Is Gonna Be Mine"" is an exultant blast of prime Flying Nun brand pop-- ramshackle, yet somehow also propulsive. ""I Caught You"" opens with a ""Venus in Furs"" drone, some repetitive piano motives and a detached Kilgour singing, ""I've got you inside my head,"" before cutting into a slippery bass groove courtesy of frequent Kilgour collaborator Noel Ward over thumping drums. ""Instra 2 Reprise"" follows, and though its title may make it sound like a tossed-off interlude, it's anything but. Kilgour delivers one of his best vocal performances over subtle percussion, wah-drenched guitar and a string arrangement by Graeme Downes of the Verlaines. The string quartet is masterfully scored to provide counterpoint to Kilgour's vocals during verses and melodic material between the verses. Brief, eastern-sounding descending lines alternate with Copeland-esque crescendos with a swooping violin lead. It's truly fantastic stuff that succeeds brilliantly without really conforming to any traditional sense of structure. Of course, there are also more of those splendid little instrumentals to be found, like ""Instra 2,"" an acoustic 12 string guitar and tack piano interlude obviously influenced by the music of South Asia. Kilgour rattles off sitar-like runs with ease and keeps the harmony ambiguous. The album closes with ""Backwards Forwards,"" which centers all of its varied wandering around a few central chords, relying on a simple cadence to bring everything full circle at regular intervals. A distant drum machine provides a pace for the proceedings, which find Kilgour alternately exploring textured strumming and slow, surf-styled leads dripping in reverb. A Feather in the Wind is actually a bit too brief at 38 minutes, and you'll barely feel the passage of time while listening to it. Complaints are hard to come by, as there's really not a single unpleasant moment on the entire album. That said, though thoroughly enjoyable, the album isn't always riveting, either, and occasionally the attention does stray. But that's hardly a reason not to throw it on when you need to chill out after a long day now is it? Kilgour has managed to craft an album that unleashes a hefty dose of beauty on the world, and that's something we can always use.","There are a lot of ways that music can be beautiful.

Even their name has no hard consonant sounds. Their music-- a mushy combination of folksy rock and avant-pop-- squishes between your fingers as you dig for a clear hook or a percussive sound. The members of the band have obvious talent and a lot of ideas, but everything sinks into a pleasing ambience. It splats against your ears like the spineless sea creatures that crawl across its back cover. The members of the Leels-- Floridians Trey Connor of Meringue, and Home alumni Chris Sturgeon and Eric Morrison-- split the singing, songwriting and instrumental work. Each of the fourteen songs has its own, creative sound: the guitar and vocal effects on ""{ {}}} {{},"" the lilting, lush melody of ""Arbor Day,"" or Sandra Shockley-Laden's gossamer flute backdrop on ""Throttle."" ""Floridian Towel,"" with its strong chorus and guest Drew Blomquist's crisp drumwork, sounds like it could fit on the first Sea and Cake album, though the Leels don't reach that band's stealthy efficiency. Even though the ideas are impressive, it takes several listens to appreciate them. The album has an appealing sound-- slightly wistful, slightly ironic-- but it's not striking, and the instruments sound like they're wrapped in gauze: ""Throttle"" goes down so easily that you can overlook its best qualities. The production may appeal to people who like the carefully produced haze of, say, the Flaming Lips, but the Lips have more electricity. Maybe it's too easy nowadays to overlook nice moments like the clarinet solos on ""Be a Part of It,"" but the experimentation on this album almost seems de rigueur, and the inventiveness doesn't convey any excitement. The more straightforward songs are also a little limp: the breezy indie pop of ""Fortunesized"" and ""Mandatory Highsteppers"" has been done better elsewhere, and the classic rock material-- ""Odessa,"" which could have come straight off Workingman's Dead, or the cover of Van Morrison's ""Precious Time""-- doesn't have the sharp vocals or crunchy guitar strumming that the style requires. The Leels let loose near the end, trying to milk a rock crescendo from the song ""Sailing Sister."" But between the lethargic vocals and the somewhat muffled guitar line, it never takes off; listening to it is like watching a three-legged dog jump for a frisbee. The chorus of ""Sailing Sister"" also demonstrates the band's biggest weakness: the singing, and especially the harmonies. On songs like ""Odessa,"" the vocals are indistinct and whiny, and they warble out of pitch; the harmony parts are off-kilter and painful. Many vocalists-- including the Lips' Wayne Coyne-- turn out great performances with (arguably) weak pipes, and the Leels have a resemblance to some other vocal anti-heroes, such as Neil Young or Jerry Garcia. However, singers like these show more personality. The Leels aren't as expressive: sometimes they sound like they're singing from the living room couch, and other times they use too much ironic detachment. On ""Closer to Be,"" Morrison can't even get a rise out of the word ""piss,"" and the lyrics about his non-status as a rock star aren't as knowing or funny as they want to be: ""We know the star is someone that I'll call yours truly/ It's time to admit that I am the shit, or else Ima get unruly."" Even a breezy, laid back album like this should sound like it could really put up a fight.","The Leels have no edge. Even their name has no hard consonant sounds.

Sketchbook,Req,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25b9d034d5c69bf2b9b/1:1/w_160/f0b03883.jpg,2002-03-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6760-sketchbook/,Warp,"Here's a fun piece of Pitchfork trivia: though they've released more than 100 albums since the late 80s, there's not a single Muslimgauze review in the Pitchfork archive. It's a matter of timing, really. Bryn Jones died before our site started covering electronic music in a serious way, and the labels he recorded for (Extreme, Staalplaat, and many others) never happened to appear on the promo radar. So until a massive reissue project gets underway, the official artist website remains the definitive source for information about the mysterious Muslimgauze. I bring up the late, great Muslimgauze not because of all the interesting things happening in the Arab world (is anyone else almost glad that Bryn Jones didn't live to see the post-September 11th political landscape?), but because I hear something familiar in this excellent new album by British hip-hop aficionado Req. It's not the tone, but the method that strikes a chord. Muslimgauze was so prolific in part because his pieces tended to be simple in construction. They were often built on the foundation of a single perfectly crafted loop, over which Jones would splatter bits of noise and various dub-derived mixing effects. Req also gets serious mileage out of a lone repeating loop, and he shows a similar affinity for a rough and ragged analog sound laced with simple melodic motifs. There's a spirited rawness to * Sketchbook * that's both disarming and immediately engaging; though elements feel familiar, the tone here is striking and unconventional. Hip-hop is an obvious touchstone, but even the most minimal hip-hop production feels thick and cluttered next to Req's naked approach. Though Req has released two albums via big beat imprint Skint, on the evidence of strange and wonderful * Sketchbook * , he'll surely feel much more at home at the more experimental Warp. A handful of interesting Aphexian ambient interludes pop up on this record, but the rhythm tracks are its heart and soul. Some of these pieces consist of nothing but a tom-tom, a bass drum, a hi-hat and the faintest hint of a chord. ""Dolby C"" could almost come from a break record, such is its relentlessly stripped-down approach to rhythm. It's uncanny how a track so ""not there"" can remain so in-your-face and hypnotic. Just as good is ""Upstairs,"" with its rusty, Brian Deck-like junkyard beats and a strange vibraphone melody repeating periodically. The percussion on these tracks is bone-dry and bass heavy, with a thud that hits like a fist to the solar plexus. When Req decided to add more elements to this sound, his inspiration can come from anywhere, which keeps the record exciting. Not tied to any theme or style, the pieces are free to veer off into uncharted textural territory. ""Sketchies Death Track"" adds a shaker, a Chinese gong, and a thumb piano to a loose, tribal beat, and ""I Seek"" is fat-bottomed hip-hop with an ominous three-note piano riff that would do the RZA proud. ""Something"" is nothing more than a closely miked drum kit, some kind of melodic percussion bit, and a sample of a vocal drone somewhere deep in the background, while ""AMPEG 18 KHZ"" is a seriously compressed funk beat with hand percussion, and some odd accordion stabs. The development throughout each track is slight but effective, always keeping you tuned in to hear what happens next. I've no doubt * Sketchbook * will be too coarse for some folks, but there is something special happening here. Most music-- even most great music-- consists of slight variations on well-established themes, and it's difficult to find an album that sounds truly new. * Sketchbook * is such a record.","Here's a fun piece of Pitchfork trivia: though they've released more than 100 albums since the late 80s ...

Vatican Nitez,Global Goon,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf37eb335119a49ed1b5/1:1/w_160/a53b82fa.jpg,2002-03-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3467-vatican-nitez/,Rephlex,"Rephlex have never got beyond being recognized as the label that Aphex helped to build. Though he's not released anything significant on the label, the Aphex ghost wanders nightly through its halls. Sometimes that spectral presence is so strong that people are ready to mistake artists entirely unrelated to Aphex as being him by another name. Johnny Hawk, who records under the wahoo Global Goon alias is a victim of mistaken identity. Hawk's debut album, 1996's Goon, was widely credited to Aphex. Guess it didn't bug him. But just a cursory listen to Goon would have let the secret out that Global Goon and Aphex were not born from the same pod; Hawk doesn't share Aphex's appreciation for modern composition and freak-out. That album, while absurd, owes more to the slo-mo wing of Braindance than to the splattercore cadre. Its opening track, ""St. Michael"" is the IDM cousin of the Fall's ""Birmingham School of Business School""-- both share a straight-faced Dadaist's reading of university course catalogs. ""Synchropeet"" is a ploddingly accompanied vocal raga for the Mogadon-dependent. Hawk's follow-up to Goon, Cradle of History, collected twenty Casio melodies and confirmed his position within the lightly comic section of the Braindance organization. Now, with his third album, Vatican Nitez, Hawk deftly combines these two threads together to produce an amalgam of absurdly faux-naif tuneful IDM. Vatican Nitez doesn't waste time with an intro (hooray!)-- it's straight into ""Business Man"" and into forty minutes of smile-inducing nuttiness. One of the first noticeable differences between this and earlier works is that it sounds as though Hawk's got access to much better equipment these days. The album doesn't sound cheap-- a gimmick that long ago lost its currency. Because he's no longer obscured by hiss, I can fully appreciate the Goon's concealed artistry. ""Jerky Dharma"" turns a dalliance with vaguely Asian tonalities into something much less patronizing. During ""I'm on the 73,"" Hawk attempts to conceal his invention by sending every musical element through an immense echo chamber. Despite his most ardent efforts, you can easily discern his idiosyncratic skill. ""Kreem Ballet"" sums up in five minutes all seven studio volumes of Pete Namlook's Dark Side of the Moog series, and further slaps down Namlook with a first-rate No Pussyfooting impression. The mid-tempo mystery named ""Stan's Slaves"" possesses such a powerful undertow that I'd love to hear what Hawk could do in collaboration with Goldfrapp. ""!"" carries on the exploration of tidal currents, adding whistling and woodblock percussion. But by the time the album gets to ""Scott Cronce Is the CEO,"" Hawk has lost steam. The swathes of ambience and the rope-thick Tubeway Army tune totally crush the generic hip-hop beats underneath. Hawk heaps some analog squiggles on top in a vain effort to distinguish the track. ""Globy Dubes, Champeen of All Americky"" nearly suffers from the same malady. But Hawk ends up correcting previous error by shooting nervy break-neck sequencer lines through the plodding hip-hop and the squiggles. Though Hawk's latest suggests that spending some chill-out time with John Paul II isn't as awkward as I'd have suspected, Vatican Nitez is far from revolutionary. Unlike former labelmate, Leila, Hawk isn't trying to redefine a sound. If you're satisfied with that, Vatican Nitez is a satisfying enough means of cerebral exertion.","Rephlex have never got beyond being recognized as the label that Aphex helped to build.

"Bravery, Repetition and Noise",The Brian Jonestown Massacre,by: Cory Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39013d1975652138afa/1:1/w_160/7b843c54.jpg,2002-03-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/927-bravery-repetition-and-noise/,Bomp,"I want to love the Brian Jonestown Massacre. I really do. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't. Don't get me wrong; they've got some great songs. But they never quite hit me the way I want them to. It took some serious effort for me to even like them as much as I do. Why would I possibly put forth so much effort to like a random band, you ask? No reason. I'm just funny that way. But seriously, I heard Strung Out in Heaven for the first time back in '98 or so, and thought, ""Wow, that's disappointing."" See, you can't just put the word ""massacre"" after your name and not expect people to have some lofty expectations. For whatever reason, I found myself drawn back to the disc a few months later and was still less than impressed. It really wasn't until I'd kinda forgotten about them, and rediscovered them last year, that I finally admitted that Strung Out in Heaven was a good record. So when I picked up Bravery, Repetition, and Noise, I figured it was now (then) or never. This was their last chance to either impress me, or convince me to give up. And what do those assholes do? They go and make a record that's so righteously mediocre that I'm back where I started. Talk about a kick in the teeth! Shit! To the band's credit, the album starts off pretty good. In fact, the upbeat yet somber second track, ""Telegram,"" is one of the best songs I've heard from them. But rest of the album never even comes close reaching that level, though not for lack of trying. ""Sailor"" is a great psychedelic song with layered vocal harmonies and fuzz guitar that sounds reminiscent of Head-era Monkees. ""Open Heart Surgery"" juxtaposes a simple haunting guitar lead in the foreground with a droning organ in the back to great success. And, I might add, the vocals really remind me of Robert Smith, and therefore, the whole thing recalls late-80s Cure (think Disintegration). And, since I've reviewed this thing all out of order so far, let me just say that the first song, ""Just for Today"" is really good, too. Unfortunately, the rest falls flat. Individually, the songs aren't bad, but the album as a whole is awfully forgettable. It all just kinda runs together and becomes background music-- rock that's accidentally ambient. One of the low points comes with ""Let Me Stand Next to Your Flower,"" which features not only a stupid title, but also an intro consisting of stringed instruments, odd random voices, and the sound of someone logging onto the Internet (that's so 1997, guys). Can you say ""Revolution 9""? Yeah, I thought you could. And it's only downhill from there. Were this album simply a six-song EP, consisting of the first six tracks, it could be really great. Of course, that's not how it went down, and as an album, Bravery, Repetition and Noise just doesn't cut it. The weird thing is that one of the songs is even on here twice. They could've left off the ""If I Love You (New European Gold Standard Secret Babylonian Brotherhood Cinema Mix),"" trimmed the fat a little, and had a damn fine release. Instead, we get ""If I Love You (New European Gold Standard Secret Babylonian Brotherhood Cinema Mix)"" in all its obnoxious unglory, weighting the record down with its unspeakable pointlessness. And what's with that Eurotrash accent? Who does Anton Newcombe think he is? Madonna? I mean, fuck!","I want to love the Brian Jonestown Massacre. I really do. But no matter how hard I try, I just ...

Definitive Jux Presents II,Various Artists,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77813d197565213940a/1:1/w_160/8891b09a.jpg,2002-03-12 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1872-definitive-jux-presents-ii/,Definitive Jux,"There's a saying my family has been trying to teach me for years about people who don't talk often. It goes something like, ""People listen to other people who don't talk often,"" or something to that effect, but with far more pith. Whatever the pithy saying is, however, I'm certain it applies with great vigor to music. Pitchfork spews like Old Faithful on just about every sub-genre on earth, and, as evidenced by our vitriolic reader mail section, you take ample liberty to pronounce us full of living shit. There is one genre, however, on which you remain notably silent. This genre is hip-hop. Although your silence could be attributed to soul-free apathy, it appears from the empirical data that it's something else entirely: an unquestioning, irrational trust of Pitchfork hip-hop recommendations, and a validation of that great, classic saying (whatever that saying in fact is). You see, we don't often write about hip-hop, but when we do, you respond by opening your wallets. I offer as proof two examples, both released in 2001: Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein, and Aesop Rock's Labor Days. If you didn't buy them, you know you went out of your way to hear them. And none of you had the balls to say an ill word. Like lemmings, you follow. While you may be our lemmings (and full disclosure, we were far from the first publication to go off about those records), we are undoubtedly Def Jux's bitch. Aesop Rock and Cannibal Ox, both pillars of the label, could tell you that. Our fidelity aside, though, Def Jux really is doing one hell of a job. It's rare that you get one joint as good as The Cold Vein or Labor Days in any given year. To have two, and both on the same label, is something close to a minor miracle. So it's on the heels of this success that Def Jux understandably desires to garner some exposure for the rest of their cast. Their latest compilation, Definitive Jux Presents II, puts several new faces in the spotlight with above average results, stopping a few steps short of greatness. If Def Jux could be defined by any single musical element, it would be the beats. The beats on DJP2 are dark, jagged, and intriguing, and not a single one of them could in any way be deemed ""danceable."" Subway beats, sewer beats-- these ones reek of the underground. The best beat comes early, on the album's first track, ""Same as It Never Was,"" by the Weathermen (featuring El-P, Vast Aire, Cage and mHz, among others). Employing an ordinary breakbeat, the song's verses are fueled by a repetitive three-chord key progression that sounds like a cross between an accordion and a Fender Rhodes. The chorus choppily and spastically misquotes the Talking Heads over a springy, oscillating sci-fi sample. All together, it's got an snarling off-kilter funk. Real nice. Aesop shows up with a ""grimace"" and a solid set of rhymes on ""Dead Pan,"" declaring in the chorus, ""No, I'm not feeling all right."" Imagine Aesop in a fussy, bad mood, and you've got a handle on this track (""Drink a bad glass of gumption/ Not bad meaning 'bad' but bad meaning 'disgusting'""). ""Hold the Floor"" features a rough, head-nodding beat and a solid battle from mHz (""Now goin' against me and thinking you ain't gonna die/ Is like skinny dippin' in hell, thinking you ain't gonna fry""). Producer RJD2 does enough on the instrumental ""I Really Like Your Def Jux Tee Baby"" to live up to the rep he gained with the heralded 2001 12-inch, ""June."" His beat on the comp visits the same emotions as the rest on DJP2, but with a little less grit, and a little more grace (like strings samples). Again, Pitchfork has spoken. This time, though, we've been let loose from our Def Jux leash. DJP2 is quite good, but not great-- if you're a big hip-hop fan, you'll want this. And as an intro to the depths of the label, it ain't half bad. But if you're close to filling your three-hip-hop-albums-per-year quota, I'd save your money for another Def Jux artist debut, and another Pitchfork orgasm.","There's a saying my family has been trying to teach me for years about people who don't talk ...

Didn't It Rain,Songs: Ohia,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b8b1335d7bf1698a1a/1:1/w_160/ea8cf68f.jpg,2002-03-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7338-didnt-it-rain/,Secretly Canadian,"The last Songs: Ohia album I heard was Ghost Tropic. That was the perfect name for its haunted post-folk, what with the sharp guitar chords, the percussion rumbling like uncontrollable spirits and Jason Molina's disconsolate wail. But each of his works as Songs: Ohia is a different beast, taking shape around the group of musicians he's currently working with. So I was a bit hesitant when I heard about the new album, which was recorded in Philadelphia with Jim Krewson and Jennie Benford of Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops, amongst other musicians. I wanted more of the Ghost Tropic sound-- a fractured structure just this side of collapse-- but here they were recording songs live in one take, with no overdubs, and garnering comparisons to the warmth of the Muscle Shoals Studio recordings during the 1970s. Within one listen, Didn't It Rain convinced me that it was worth paying attention to its own terms. Songs: Ohia's compositions have a strange way of warping time for the listener. How else could the opening title track slip by me after nearly eight minutes? It begins in a slow progression of acoustic chords, and almost immediately Molina is singing about the eye of the storm, and those caught under its downpour. The chorus wells up with trilling guitar notes and Jennie Benford providing backing vocals, and Molina warns, ""If you think you got it/ They're gonna beat it out of you/ Through work and debt."" Calling a recording ""intimate"" can be cliché, but I swear you can practically hear the floorboards creaking. The song swells and sighs for minutes like a vintage Neil Young ballad, until right near the end when Molina asks the question in the song title. I thought that Didn't It Rain might be more light of heart, like some of the Palace records Songs: Ohia is often compared to. In the previous song, Molina asks the group audibly to bring it back for another chorus, and it doesn't detract from the music at all. But it seems his tropical depression has lingered, despite titles like ""Steve Albini's Blues"" and ""Cross the Road, Molina."" The former lopes along deliberately, the pace set by banjo-like plinks and made more tense by the relative silence that pervades. Molina, Benford and Krewson join together to sing, ""See its sulfury shine/ See the big city moon/ 'Tween the radio tower/ 'Tween the big diesel rigs."" Reviewers often mention Molina's blue-collar background, but I'm not going to try to prove anyone's cred. Someone (probably Krewson) howls the line ""see the big city moon"" again, and the last-dime desperation in his twangy voice is authenticity enough. There's a shared imagery that becomes evident, especially on ""Ring the Bell"" and ""Cross the Road, Molina,"" two songs in the middle of the album that flow together as a conceptual piece. It's here that Molina might seem too far gone in gloom, as he begs, ""Show us how bad we're outnumbered,"" but the compositions never reach the Gormenghastly nature of ""apocalyptic folk"" groups like Death in June. There's a bleak beauty in the arc of the amped electric strings, and when the Chicago moon ""swings like a blade,"" Molina may even be painting himself as the Andalusian dog. You can trace the lyrical themes: light, darkness, the moon, fire, Chicago. Those themes are evoked again on ""Two Blue Lights,"" a brief blues piece about the light from a bus and the moon, about hell and your hometown. Is it the scraping sounds of the frets that make it so earthy and uplifting? I'll throw my cards down now: ""Blue Factory Flame"" is a classic. Drum-kit percussion enters for the first time, setting a steady 4/4 frame as Molina asks, ""When I die, put my bones in an empty street/ Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio/ A Cleveland game and a fishing pole."" The black-hearted procession continues as he describes ghostly iron ore ships coming home, and climaxes in the refrain ""paralyzed by emptiness."" It's as apt a summary of depression's effects as I've heard, and the electric guitar emits a stark, weathered sort of sadness. Musically, ""Blue Chicago Moon"" evokes more of that aged Rust Belt atmosphere, but Molina admits that you're not helpless when you're hunted by the blues, and he calls out over and over for you to ""try to beat it, try to beat it."" From the first song, it seems that Didn't It Rain is intended as a bulwark against sorrow, and that commitment appears again on this last track. The compositions here are elemental, filled with flame as well as steel and stone, and they tie Molina's native Ohio together with his current home, Chicago. In the process of recording another incredible album, he's discovered that light is most visible when it's flickering alone in the dark.","The last Songs: Ohia album I heard was Ghost Tropic.

Prepare to Die,Nate Denver's Neck,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a669fc7814a47cd6c9/1:1/w_160/011cd5c9.gif,2002-03-12 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5715-prepare-to-die/,King Crab,"It's just too damn easy to record and release an album these days. I used to firmly believe that as technology made things easier, quality would improve. I'm not sure now how I ever came to hold this foolish belief. Maybe it was too much pro-tech sci-fi as a kid, or maybe a naïve believe in the democratizing effects of computers that somehow was carried over into the realm of art. At any rate, the bottom line is, I was wrong. Computer recording technology, by making it essentially as easy to release a CD as it is to bathe your dog, has only increased the amount of shit being put out. Lest there be any doubt, go to any used bin in the country. And as further proof, I offer up this CD from Nate Denver's Neck. Someone, somewhere, at some point in the whole process, should have stopped this from ever reaching my desk. What's being aimed at here (presumably) is a skewed children's album of electro/folk interspersed with sound collages and spoken word field recordings-- a fairly admirable goal, but the main problem is that it's carried off in such a mindless fashion that Prepare to Die teeters from mildly annoying to completely unlistenable over the course of 39 tiring minutes. The other main problem is that the album can't make up its mind whether it wants to be comedy/novelty album, or an album exploring ""deep"" philosophical questions (the kind of questions that tend to come up amongst friends in a college dormitory at about the time the last cold brews are being sipped). This lack of focus makes for an album that's neither very funny, nor very intellectually penetrating. There are a few cheap laughs like a muzak-like tribute to Slayer's ""Raining Blood,"" and ""Smashoptomus,"" the story of a childhood toy come back for revenge after its owner grows up and locks it in the closet for years. But, at it's best, Prepare to Die sounds like a particularly uninspired Ween jerk-off studio session. The most perplexing thing is that the label which released this is run by none other than Mick Turner of the Dirty Three. The Marquis de Tren himself, whose music I love. Maybe he owed the guy a favor or something. Seriously, Mick, let's have some standards here.","It's just too damn easy to record and release an album these days.

Calling Zero,Go Back Snowball - Robert Pollard and Mac McCaughan,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf3eabf31b7dc7156299/1:1/w_160/9c21b442.gif,2002-03-11 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3474-calling-zero/,Fading Captain,"History has seen many important summits bringing together some of the world's most powerful men. Who could forget the historic 1972 meeting of Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao in Beijing? Or the tense Cold War rendezvous between JFK and Nikolai Khruschchev back in '61? Even recently, we've seen George Bush I spraying his lunch all over the Japanese Prime Minister, and Vladimir Putin chopping wood with G-Dubs at the ""Western White House."" Well guess what, indie rockers? Now we have our very own version of a presidential summit, an album-length collaboration from prolific boozehound Robert Pollard and the formerly hyper-enough Mac McCaughan. Okay, so maybe the analogy is a little ridiculous, as Pollard and McCaughan aren't brokering any arms treaties between Dayton and Chapel Hill on Calling Zero. But the project does reflect one key feature of most political summits, in that there's a whole lot of pomp and circumstance, but not much in the way of substantial results. Calling Zero is the nineteenth album in Pollard's ""Fading Captain"" series, King Shit's wildly inconsistent quest to build up a solo catalog of Merzbox-like scope. And like many recent releases from the series, the album utilizes Pollard's favorite trick of late: soliciting instrumental tracks from friends and overdubbing liberal amounts of his trademark arena-rock-in-a-can vocals. Here, for the first time, he goes outside the very extended Guided by Voices family to choose Superchunk frontman McCaughan as a collaborator. It sounds like the wet dream of a mid-90s college radio DJ, but unfortunately, Go Back Snowball's total does not add up to the sum of its individual parts. If, like me, you prayed that McCaughan would steer Pollard out of the increasingly clichéd slump he's been in since the heyday of the Classic Dayton Lineup, well, keep on prayin'. McCaughan's poppish ways and newfound restraint would seem to fill the gap that Tobin Sprout's departure has left in recent GBV work, but like the similar-concept Airport 5 albums with Sprout, the songs here sound largely half-baked and awkwardly constructed. For this failure, I blame the device. It's hard to fault McCaughan, who, responsible for all the instrumentation on Calling Zero, submits a number of interesting musical ideas in the lighter vein of the last two Superchunk albums. Prominently using old keyboards and budget electronics, a number of tracks (""Climb,"" ""Throat of Throats"") have a distinctly Stephen Merritt-esque sound, while ""Radical Girl"" and ""Dumbluck Systems Storefront"" smartly incorporate brass sections. But these airy constructions sound tailored to the fragile, high voice of McCaughan, not the cock-rock swagger of Pollard. Try to imagine Uncle Bob singing Here's to Shutting Up's ""Late-Century Dream"" and you'll get the idea. Even when McCaughan cranks up the old distortion pedal on ""Lifetime for the Mavericks,"" the high-flying vocals sound strangely out of place. ""Mavericks"" also supplies an excellent example of the other problem plaguing Calling Zero: the excessively thin and demo-like sound. In many cases, the songs would be improved greatly by the strident drumming of Superchunk's Jon Wurster, or the bass-playing of, well, anybody, since there's hardly any low-end to be found. A more lo-fi approach might've covered up these omissions as well, with the tape hiss of old GBV warming up the sparse decor, but the overly slick sound only highlights the shortcomings. As such, Calling Zero is far too entrenched in the middle, not playing enough to Pollard's opposing strengths of microphone-swinging rock or four-track experimentalism. The bright spots (""I Am Divine,"" the title track) suggest a certain amount of chemistry between the quasi-famous duo, but the slapdash feel of the rest make one wonder if a face-to-face interaction would've been more rewarding than this collaboration-by-mail. I'm sorry to report we'll all have to continuing waiting for indie-rock's answer to the powerful Jay-Z/R. Kelly alliance. The best of both worlds, baby.","History has seen many important summits bringing together some of the world's most\n\ powerful men. Who could forget ...

Chiff-Chaffs and Willow Warblers,Minotaur Shock,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c54cc0084474cd0c36f9/1:1/w_160/86d48e36.jpg,2002-03-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5314-chiff-chaffs-and-willow-warblers/,Melodic,"I have a dream. In that dream, there are no names for music. Music just is. You heard me. No country. No rock. No rap, polka, classical or experimental. And certainly, in this dream, there is no such thing as ""electronic music."" See, one thing I've never really understood is contemporary electronic music's apparent need to separate itself from the rest of the world's music. The insistence of putting the word ""electronic"" in front of the word ""music"" draws a line that needn't exist, frightening away potential listeners and setting in motion certain unnecessary presumptions. Distinctions as simple as ""electronic music"" assume a music that's simple, too. And while ""simple"" is hardly a term that fits much of today's music, far too often electronic music is. Half a century ago things were different. Visionaries like Luciano Berio and Edgar Varese saw electronics as part of the greater picture. Littering their avant-garde compositions with sounds both natural and computer-borne, they juxtaposed the natural and the synthetic, along the way posing the question as to just how far removed these sounds even were from one another. But since the popularization of electronic music in the early 1990s, it's often seemed like we've taken a step back. More often than not, music is categorized as either electronic or otherwise. There would seem to be no in between. This tendency to segregate two perfectly compatible styles of music continues to baffle me. And apparently, I'm not alone. As evidenced by Radiohead's recent steps toward the abstract, Mouse on Mars' electro-acoustic grooves, and recent works by Cex, the Shalabi Effect and Múm, all of which have made use of both electronics and ""real"" instruments, the general populace is growing more comfortable with the idea of blurring this line. It's this willingness to cross needless genre lines that saves David Edwards' solo electronic project, Minotaur Shock, from the void of IDM anonymity. Chiff-Chaffs and Willow Warblers opens ordinarily enough: morphing beats, chopped up sounds, smooth synth textures; your average student of the Morr Music School for Pretty IDM. Is it nice-sounding? Yup. Well produced? Uh-huh. Enjoyable? Sure. Memorable? Well... let's put it this way: turn it on in a room full of people; no one's liable to complain, though it seems unlikely anyone will give it a second thought. But watch those heads turn the very moment a simply strummed acoustic guitar is dropped into the mix on the third track, ""First to Back Down."" Marvel at the way a sampled trumpet brings the beats grinding to a halt and breathes new life into ""Moray Arrival."" The addition of glockenspiel, recorder, vibraphone, and a slew of other acoustic instruments lifts this release from the pits of mediocrity. Granted, there are solid electronically produced moments, too. ""The Range"" infuses typical Chicago-style post-rock with minimal glitch-house loops, deconstructing a McCombs-ian bassline held over from the prior track, dicing it, bouncing the results from speaker to speaker in time with the music while synthesized vibraphone and melodica flavors the track. On ""Out of the Hot,"" a gentle synth backdrop makes for great contrast with the garbled beats and piercing Atari melodies. Still, the best moments here are those that infuse the mechanical with the organic. Like the reprisal of the aforementioned Atari melody later in the album, voiced this time instead by a bunch of string instruments. Or ""Local Violin Shop,"" which opens with a basic repeated Rhodes keyboard figure before adding an acoustic guitar and static beeping, followed by live, non-processed drums. It proceeds for about a minute as an acoustic rock number, before you realize that you're no longer hearing guitar, but rather guitar loops. Soon, all natural sound but the drums have dropped out, only to be replaced by an explosion of digitally processed keyboard and guitar. Sounds get layered upon one another. It becomes impossible to tell what's processed and what's not. There's an escalation, a climax, and a return to the simple acoustic instruments with which the track began. It's an amazing song from start to finish. Chiff-Chaffs and Willow Warblers has its fair share of such moments, but not quite enough to put it in the same class as similar artists like Múm or ISAN. Of course, if this sort of gentle-beat-driven thing is your bag, it's unlikely you'll find much to argue with here. Edwards would do well to stick to his guns and add even more acoustic toys to the mix on future attempts. Without a doubt, his liberal use of such instrumentation is refreshing, not to mention a step in the direction of an emancipated musical utopia where no one is bound by restrictive genre-names and where sounds interact any which way they damned well please.","I have a dream.

Combing the Clouds,Waking Eyes,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9c113d19756521398f6/1:1/w_160/61b91a7f.gif,2002-03-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8566-combing-the-clouds/,Endearing,"Some bands just need a producer. These days, when just about anyone can buy some recording equipment and make a halfway decent sounding album, a lot of bands seem to think they can get away with doing everything themselves. Some of them are right, of course, and a lot of self-produced bands churn out some amazing work. But most of these bands are, frankly, kidding themselves. Case in point: the Waking Eyes, who at some point decided it would for the best if they produced their own debut record, Combing the Clouds. Perhaps it was merely a practical matter-- producers can be expensive, of course-- or perhaps they had other motives, but whatever the reason, it's clear from listening to the album that the band could stand an outside voice informing their creative projects. Featuring past members of the Pets and Novillero, the Waking Eyes aren't exactly dewy-eyed newcomers, and it shows in the songwriting. The band writes solid melodies, backed by imaginative progressions and arrangement ideas. The primary problems lie in its execution. Sonically speaking, Combing the Clouds is a 48-minute stroll through a musical used car lot full of sounds bought back wholesale from the 70s and very late 60s. The band piles on affectations and vintage-sounding instruments to the point where it becomes hard to see the songs for the clever compositions they are. This is where a producer could come in very handy-- someone a little less attached to the music could easily point out the fat in these songs and convince the band that some trimming is needed to make it more digestible. A set of outside ears (at the very least, an experienced engineer) could also have done wonders for this record simply by making the mix more vibrant. Frequently, the album simply sounds dull in the places where it's vital that it hook you. Take the two ballads nestled at tracks four and five: ""Castle by the Bay"" and ""Gone with a Glance."" ""Castle by the Bay"" features a nice horn arrangement, a good melody and some fine group vocals, but virtually no sense of discretion in placing all of those elements together. The bass and keyboards bleed together and the horns play in the background as though someone turned on a radio during the recording session. The vocals are recorded in such a way that they manage to fade into the music as though they were just another element in a sonic wallpaper pattern. ""Gone with a Glance"" suffers similar problems at first, beginning as a simple piano ballad before adding a rhythm section and a terrible synthesized string patch. The second verse finds the vocals struggling to be heard above a wandering, wholly unnecessary clarinet part. After the leaden second chorus, the song suddenly mutates into a poorly realized Queen tribute, complete with heavily overdubbed vocals and Brian May-style harmonized guitar leads. The dramatic effect that Queen managed to achieve with that sound, however, is lost completely in the muddled mix-- the guitar quickly sinks below everything else, and the ""choir"" never comes to the fore at all. Other songs show promise, but get lost in their affectations, like the psychedelic ""New Rising Sun,"" a Cream-y ball of fuzz packed with organ that could be called Doorsy, though a more accurate comparison might be Smash Mouth. The breakdown is a somewhat interesting section dominated by percussion and tape effects, but even that's pretty muddy sounding. ""The World It's Alive"" has some nice, easy-going rhythms and a neat tejano horn section, but the great tune is lost in a clutter of noise and hyperactive keyboards. ""Tergo Velum"" is actually a great song, with a yearning melody and some fine backing harmonies, but once again, the band doesn't seem to know when to stop adding things to the mix. What could be a striking acoustic song is drowned in inconsequential little squiggles and unnecessary violin and clarinet noodling. ""Make a Sound"" follows with yet another fine melody, this time delivered a bit more effectively. Unfortunately, the horn arrangement is lost under the rest of the instruments, but the various sections of the song segue rather nicely together. There's even one of those moments that makes you look around the room for the source of a sound, as a watch alarm goes off right at the end of the second chorus. It's a fun little addition that just might send you to the back button to make sure that it was actually on the record and not somewhere in your house. A few other songs work reasonably well, such as the opener ""Combs for the Clouds,"" with its fine harmonies, elastic bassline and relatively uncluttered production. ""Anytime"" is similarly modest in its trappings and delivers the album's strongest hook to boot. Granted, even this song suffers from some unfocused moments, such as the short passage before the third verse, but by and large, it's a decent song that allows its melody to shine appropriately. Also surprisingly successful is ""Sunday Morning Blues,"" fully delivering on its title. The band transitions from lo-fi acoustic blues straight into a healthy electric shuffle featuring some impressive, dirty guitar leads. The organ is obviously not a real Hammond, instead emitting a rather weak tone that unfortunately makes the arrangement sound bit thin, but the band makes up for it with a good feel and some astounding lead guitar work. A rocking midsection and an oddball circus music interlude don't contribute much to the song, but they don't detract much from it, either. And on this album, that's basically all you can ask for. But ""Sunday Morning Blues"" also illustrates some of the most frustrating things about the Waking Eyes. Obviously, they're very talented musicians, and fine songwriters as well. They rotate vocals and instruments with aplomb, rarely failing to deliver a competent performance. However, their tendency to get carried away during recording is ultimately too much for their considerable skills to handle, and the album fails to make much of an impact. To bring things full circle, a little bit of outside input might be all this band needs to work their way up into the 8.0 realm. Here's hoping they get it on future efforts.","Some bands just need a producer. These days, when just about anyone can buy some recording equipment and make a ...

NIVRAYM,Koenji-Hyakkei,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe5ea9e61561daa7346/1:1/w_160/37dd8aae.jpg,2002-03-11 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4504-nivraym/,Magaibutsu,"Tatsuya Yoshida is somewhere in Japan right now, and you can bet he's got visions of sugarplum zeuhl demons dancing in his head. It's worse for him than you might think: while most of us were engrossed in real stereophonic performances of Fun House or Radio City, Yoshida must have been burning to play on the same stage, or in some way act on his own theatric instincts, to create rock music that would defy the tradition laid out by a million critics worshipping Chuck Berry and the Stones. And then came punk. But not long after The Year Punk Broke, all the drama you whiled away in became uncool and pretentious. So you and Yoshida had a stalemate, right? How do you reconcile rock attitude, punk apathy and prog, well... strangeness? Enter Ruins, a drums-n-bass duo who played harder than most and screamed better than anyone you knew. And not least importantly, they had their Magma riffs down. This was not prog, mind you, and it certainly wasn't punk (imagine Paul Simonon trying to play ""Graviyaunosch""-- yikes!), but it has more indie cred than both put together. I mean, what's more alternative than playing a five-string bass while yodeling in a made-up language (one actually based on another made-up language) and recording your ""commercial"" album with Steve Albini? I'll just come out and say it: this is not for everyone. But Yoshida has gotten around this pesky gap between the genres by compartmentalizing his music. He has projects that deal exclusively with group improvisation, some that deal with noise, a couple of really good all-instrumental punk-prog bands, and Koenji-Hyakkei. Koenji is a unique concept for Yoshida, and it may go down as his greatest achievement: the most perfect fusion of straight prog, the avant-garde and hardcore punk. Amen. This is Koenji's third album, and for the record, it's even more overtly proggy than the first two. Former vocalist Aki Kubota left the band, and for any of you who thought she was irreplaceable, you're only half right: Oguchi Kenichi easily fulfills her old role as keyboardist, and much of the music seems to have been written to suit his strengths; and new vocalist Samara Name certainly has the vocal chops to pull off more than her fair share of theatrics. The biggest losses here are Kubota's compositions, which were always among the band's most colorful, particularly given Yoshida's propensity to dominate the proceedings with the vocalist/writer/drummer trisect. She will be missed, but even if the direction has changed slightly, the enthusiasm has not. On NIVRAYM, there's a newfound emphasis on keyboard textures, and a whole new bag of solo breaks. The other Koenji albums stood out from the pack for any number of reasons, but particularly in their lack of flashy improv. Here, Kenichi gets in his licks and then some, similar to Ruins' Symphonica (unusual for the group, with added singers and keyboards), on which he impractically stole the show. In fact, much of this album reminds of Symphonica, also due to a slightly lighter sound than its predecessors. It's no cakewalk, but it's not quite the overloaded powder keg of 1997's II, either. This suits the synths, as well as the vocal lines, which are ever closer to that hallowed qualifier of lore known as ""almost normal."" But normal is relative, of course, and here, it refers mostly to Magma's zeuhl heritage, and the occasional dramatic soprano lead. Instrumentally, the band plays fairly close to hard-edged Rock In Opposition sound. There's a lot of traditional avant-prog to this music, with very complex instrumental counterpoint and a kind of playful attitude to experimentation, but the abrasive elements bring it closer to the post-modern of old new-schoolers like John Zorn and Mr. Bungle. Overall, NIVRAYM is more refined, and none the cornier for it. One of the great things about this record (and this kind of stuff in general) is that it seems such a glorious reaction to the great records of the past, rather than indebted to them. Put simply: NIVRAYM is one of the better records I heard in 2001. It's fun, challenging, and you'll learn a lot. No, wait, that's school. Try this: it's fun, challenging, and will kick your ass all the way back to Wednesday. Yeah, that sounds right.","Tatsuya Yoshida is somewhere in Japan right now, and you can bet he's got visions of sugarplum zeuhl demons ...

Dark Noontide,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42bb1335d7bf16988c4/1:1/w_160/b21fc88c.jpg,2002-03-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7199-dark-noontide/,Holy Mountain,"The best psychedelic music doesn't require the aid of pharmaceuticals. The 13th Floor Elevators' first album, Love's Forever Changes, Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and other such mind-expanding classics can get the job done on their own. They don't need much outside help in the form of drugs, or anything else for that matter. The way I see it, if an album needs drugs to make it enjoyable or emotionally moving, then-- by definition-- it's lacking something. I don't think I'm being prudish when I say, at its best, psychedelic music should be a more-than-adequate substitute for drugs. If psychedelic music is simply music to take drugs to, then the latest Creed album is the most psychedelic album ever: it makes me want to take drugs-- all of them, as quickly as possible. While nowhere near as accomplished as the above mentioned albums (and not really sounding much like them, either), this second LP from a Northern Californian tree-sitting, psychedelic ewok-cum-John-Fahey-disciple named Ben Chasny and his (essentially) one man acoustic drone/raga outfit Six Organs of Admittance certainly needs no lysergic crutch, despite its outward trappings which might suggest otherwise. Dark Noontide is basically a tribal-psych album with acoustic guitar serving as the campfire around which flutes, recorders, tablas, bells, chimes, and sundry other instruments dance. It's not a playful, frolicking dance; it has a somber and contemplative tone, almost funereal at times. Three out of the eight songs also feature Chasny's singing, which is somewhat hard to pin down. Sometimes it sounds like a less operatic Tim Buckley (maybe hard to imagine), a gravel-voiced Roger McGuinn, or maybe Skip Spence. Still, it's nicely distinctive and perfectly matched to the musical accompaniment. The album opens with the solemn blues of ""Spirits Abandoned,"" with Chasny singing the refrain, ""I know what you've done/ What you've become,"" with an almost zen-like detachment, as if the subject of the song is just too overwhelming to be dealt with head-on. ""This Hand"" mixes pseudo-religious lyrics with the best use of a buzzing guitar string since Neil Young's ""Ambulance Blues,"" while the album ends with a comparatively rockish tune called ""A Thousand Birds."" Propelled by a driving acoustic guitar riff, the song explodes into a distorted, spastic electric guitar freakout, ending the album in unexpected fashion, given the loose, meditative feel of what preceded it. Between these more ""song-oriented"" pieces, there are a couple of short solo acoustic numbers that many Fahey fans would appreciate, along with some other noise/drone improv pieces similar to the ones Tower Recordings have dedicated themselves to releasing. On their own, these tracks aren't anything spectacular. But as part of Dark Noontide's expansive whole, they have the ability to transport you to another world like few modern-day psychedelic recordings can. A kaleidoscopic, hallucinatory experience, all without the aid of drugs. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.","The best psychedelic music doesn't require the aid of pharmaceuticals.

Prickle EP,Mira Calix,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e5c0084474cd0c05b6/1:1/w_160/5f18914a.gif,2002-03-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1246-prickle-ep/,Warp,"Why wouldn't you take Mira Calix seriously? Granted, her work generally sees favorable reviews, but I've seen a lot of offhand comments from IDM kids who dismiss her because she used to work as press secretary for Warp. It's clear even from her small discography as DJ and composer that Chantal Passamonte isn't trying to be the female Aphex Twin, regardless of how many have made that comparison. Richard James, Mike Paradinas & Co. camp out in what Rephlex has come to call the ""braindance"" tradition-- their brand of cerebral mindfuckery. Passamonte's 2000 release One on One expressed an almost obsessive attention to sonic contiguity, the result being a hypersensual world of sound that flowed in its own mysterious patterns. Her use of soft, whispered vocals also added a level of intimacy not often found with the lads mentioned above. Prickle followed as an EP in May of 2001. If the review is a bit late, please forgive; I've been lost in the 19-minute opening track. It's never given the name ""Prickle,"" but rather is subdivided into four suites. The first, ""Miliaria,"" is named appropriately, in that ""mili-"" and ""-ia"" both suggest unquantifiable vastness. Static flutters out of your headphones and other phenomena mill about in the periphery. A sense of scale develops as a dense hiss rises above like a synthetic stormcloud. Brief, melancholy piano phrases give form to the mix, followed by thumping beats that remind of Posthuman's debut. Passamonte's wispy singing tempers the cold swells of the keyboard, echoing beautifully. After roughly eight minutes that movement fades, and the human touch is subsumed into alien environs populated by glitchy chirps and analogue squirts. Right around this point I lose what little footing I had. Thudding percussion reverberates under avian quibbling, threatening to turn my walk home into a safari. I'm saved by biomechanical crackling, an oblique machine-rhythm of some sort that brings me back from the veldt. The album sleeve features childlike sketches of flora and fauna set amongst an expansive plain. Together with the music, it's a fitting evocation of Mira Calix' South African homeland by way of London's sound. If you can't be at home, might as well take a little world with you. The second and final track is a remix of One on One's ""Skin with Me,"" courtesy of Andrea Parker. As might be imagined, it's got an electro vibe, framed by that light tchak hit on the fourth beat and fleshed out by anthemic synth vamps. Parker loops a fragment of Passamonte's voice for the main melodic line, very similar in result to Moby's retooling of the Smashing Pumpkins' ""1979,"" in which he isolated that wibbling ""tweeee"" effect and slowed it to an unsettling speed, building up his own song around the sample. It's the kind of piece that's danceable but difficult to imagine on a dancefloor; you'd have more luck with it as a choreograph routine for that diva from The Fifth Element. The remix works as a nice coda for Passamonte's opus-in-microcosm.","Why wouldn't you take Mira Calix seriously? Granted, her work generally sees favorable reviews, but I've seen a ...

Side Effects,Eardrum,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd9abf31b7dc7155ba6/1:1/w_160/6ef27c49.jpg,2002-03-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2644-side-effects/,Leaf,"Eardrum's primary partnership of Lou Cicotelli and Richard Baker have been providing jazzbo hipsters with high concept drum-circle tracks since 1996. Cicotelli has also given up some lo-end theory for post-modern primitives Pram and Laika, but those acts never gave him the freedom to realize his Afro-beat-on-Saturn rhythmic abstractions. Performing live and then editing the tracks in a Teo Macero-like manner, Eardrum hope to preserve the spontaneity of live performance, and to shape their jams into something far greater than the sum of its individual parts. But despite their noble intentions, Eardrum only partially succeed. Side Effects is an enormous canvas upon which Eardrum and a legion of guest percussionists have painted fragments of rhythm. The risk that Eardrum run is that the album could be too thickly layered to make any headway through. And indeed, the band's gamble never fully pays off. Side Effects is not mere smog; it's hardening concrete. A shame, because Cicotelli and Baker and their guests-- Jason Yarde (of J Life, Yoruba Jazz People and Manu Dibango), Folasade Barbarinde (of Adzido Pan African Dance and Drum Ensemble), Gary Jeff (of Mass, God, and Scalpel), Nii Tagoe (of Adzido, Frititi, and African Head Charge), Nana Tsiboe (of Dade Krama, Moire Drum Orchestra, and Trouble Dat) and Laika's Guy Fixsen-- are really quite competent as musicians. It's just that the music is impenetrable. Perhaps my concern about Side Effects is due to my limited exposure to avant-garde percussion albums. Sure, I've enjoyed Evelyn Glennie's conservatoire-junglist album Shadow Behind the Iron Sun and done a lifetime's worth of Watusis to Toby Dammit's Top Dollar. But Eardrum's Miles-on-Mars remix of Sofa Surfers' ""Guns 'n' Bombs 'n' Knives"" still bugs me out whenever I hear it. So I concede that I may be at fault. Nonetheless, let me outline my misgivings. The biggest problem I see with Side Effects is that the individual tracks have little for me to latch onto, with the exception of a few select tracks. ""Sandblasted,"" with its sax squalls and insistent bass rhythms, sounds as though Eardrum have captured the Master Musicians of Jajouka and promised their release, provided the guys make a monstrous enough racket. ""Two Strangers,"" accompanied by Imade Iyamu's chants, allows Guy Fixsen's Moog to squiggle and farp. ""Trickster Tale"" sends Sun Ra's Arkestra on an echoed-out journey beyond the orbit of Neptune. The relentless bass boom and cowbell-ish tones of ""Bone Room"" could serve as the basis for a mega-ton Techno Animal doom rap track. The gloriously sullied ""Escape from Evil"" traps Chic's wikky-wikky guitar sound and uses it as a birch to whip the devoid-of-funk. However, too many tracks-- such as ""Family Mask,"" the album opener-- remain impenetrable, as their percussive resilience balks at comprehension. I've even tried to listen to ""Family Mask"" as wallpaper, but to little success. I really want to engage with the apocalyptic voodoo madness within, but maybe I'm just not skilled or pure enough to be granted entry. I doubt very much that Eardrum are expecting huge sales for Side Effects. Although some occasionally eclectic DJs might want a copy as an exotic tool to break up their sets with, Side Effects' uncompromising murkiness is likely to prevent all but the most devoted from enjoying it.","Eardrum's primary partnership of Lou Cicotelli and Richard Baker have been providing jazzbo hipsters with high concept drum-circle tracks ...

"What Cannot Be, But Is",Vitesse,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96313d1975652139861/1:1/w_160/29264118.gif,2002-03-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8479-what-cannot-be-but-is/,Acuarela,"Some great bands will just never be quite as great as you want them to be. There are loads and loads of reasons this can happen, but when it comes to indie music, it's usually because they aren't trying. And so, like a basement-dwelling stoner's gainfully employed girlfriend, you sit around loving them deeply, not wanting to criticize but knowing they could Do Great Things if they'd only give it an honest shot. Sometimes I think I feel that way about Vitesse. Here's the deal: they released two gorgeous records before this one. Both revolve around serious mining of early-to-mid-80s British rainy-day indie and synth-pop-- New Order, Electronic, early Depeche Mode, OMD-- which is to say that they consist of moody pop songs constructed from sweepy/bleepy synth programming, shimmery guitar arpeggios, and dour, bittersweet crooning. They also fall pretty squarely into the whole bedroom-indie aesthetic, meaning that these records sound, well, bedroomy-- intimate, a little lo-fi, and a little bit rigged with duct tape. I'll discuss Stephin Merritt momentarily. The first Vitesse record was called A Certain Hostility, and it was great: all twinkly synths and sleepy melodies and an absolute swooner of a track called ""A Fine Young Age""; most of it fell closer to Holiday-era Magnetic Fields than those common-ancestor Brits. The second record was called Chelsea 27099, and not only was it great, but it signified a slight attitude shift: same rainy days, but suddenly the synths were colder and buzzier, the drum machines more booming, suspicious squints all over the vocals. I-- and, full disclosure, the ""I"" here is shamelessly devoted to moody early-80s Brit indie, the ""I"" lives for it-- couldn't wait for Vitesse to blossom. There's nothing massively interesting about hearing synthy stuff bedroom-style. It's charming as hell for a couple records, but here's the thing: I believe in Vitesse. They sound fabulous, and sometimes their songwriting is as spot-on as I could possibly ask for. So I wanted to hear these synth symphonies writ large-- I wanted to see them chuck the comfy sweaters and bedheads and get all slicked up and flashy in beautiful suits. I wanted to hear them top My Favorite's ""Homeless Club Kids"" (incredibly stiff competition in this milieu), or put a pop challenge to the hi-fi electro grcooves of Felix da Housecat and Adult. I wanted ambition. Which is why What Can Not Be, But Is... is slightly painful to me. It's lovely, really, as adorable as either of the last two records. Maybe less, depending-- the songs here seem a tad weaker than before-- but close, anyway. It skims and pulses along on hi-hats and synth pads and Peter Hook riffs and wispy vocals as sweetly and melodically as anything else they've done, which you can probably tell is sort of my problem. Need I mention the guilt involved in being dissatisfied with something I enjoy so much? But there you have it: this record contains eight Vitesse-penned tracks that, if I didn't like them, I would likely call ""re-hashed,"" plus two covers (OMD's ""2nd Thought"" and Bruce Springsteen's ""Unsatisfied Heart""), the first of which pleases with its immaculate New Order-isms and the latter of which slots surprisingly well into the Stephin Merritt-ish sound they're sliding back toward. The rest swoons pleasantly enough. They're probably content this way, unambitiously sending out solid bedroom communiqués every year or two. Probably they have other things they're busy with: Josh Klein writes for The Onion, and I imagine Hewson Chen has something stimulating to do-- growing up in America listening to posh British synth-indie used to be a pretty surefire way to wind up reading lots of books, and University of Chicago grads do okay in the job market. Klein's never really dug into a band, anyway: he played drums on the first Toulouse record-- which was similarly great enough that you wished they'd taken on more-- and did a similar bow-out from Aden, about whom ditto. A Certain Hostility was supposedly recorded in 36 hours, and it doesn't sound as if they've started clearing second weekends for their projects. Exactly how fortunate are we that David Grubbs is the only University of Chicago guy who thinks big? Must I really be the high school English teacher who explains that she only grades them down because she can see that they have more potential than that? Strip away my fretting, though: a simpler way of saying all of this is that if you like the Magnetic Fields' Holiday (or the 6ths' Wasp's Nest, or even Orange Cake Mix, while we're at it), you should buy some Vitesse records immediately. Hopefully, you'll never face the day when you realize you're going to stop caring about new ones if they're not going to show some commitment. A different simple way of saying this is just to quote Hewson Chen, from ""Starlight"": ""Sometimes you've just got to try a little harder.""","Some great bands will just never be quite as great as you want them to be.\n\ There are loads ...

Darkest Hour,Slackjaw,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44d9d034d5c69bf302c/1:1/w_160/604491d2.gif,2002-03-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7232-darkest-hour/,No Karma,"When I received Slackjaw's Darkest Hour, my first reaction was to groan and construct a lengthy laundry list of superficial complaints-- the band name (ugh), the typeface (awful), the cover art (goofy, maudlin photography), the photos of androgynous pink-haired teenagers in the liner notes (make it stop), the song titles (for the love of god, ""Your Beauty, The Sunrise?!""), and the profound sense of foreboding the preceding qualities ensured. Superficial issues aside: Slackjaw's Darkest Hour may be the best example of a 5.0 record I've ever heard. Its physical attributes are more or less average-- nine songs in 46 minutes, most of which average around the five-minute mark (excepting one short song and one long song). The sound falls squarely between nouveau emo and Radiohead-inspired album rock. The musicians are competent, the songwriting is occasionally inspired and occasionally abysmal, but largely pleasant, pedestrian, and innocuous. The lyrics mostly rhyme, contain a requisite amount of postmodern malaise, and sometimes employ pretty poetic affectation. Most of the songs seem to be about failing relationships and the sort of existential angst associated with mornings after and drinking alone. And you could say: ""Well, you could say the same thing about a lot of bands-- almost every band, in fact."" Which would prove my point. That, right there, is the heart of the 5.0. Average. And there's nothing inherently wrong with average. It's a glass half-full or half-empty scenario. For the case of half-full: ""The First Thing to Go,"" the album's opener, is lush and cinematic, building on a pleasant sort of white-noised soundscape. Singer Eric Schopmeyer's hushed vocal technique provides a nice complement to the music itself. It evokes the right sort of pretty, yet sad tone that dominates the rest of the album. For a threesome, Slackjaw has a relatively full sound, assisted in part by a wide variety of instrumentation. And I'll give them this: it's hard to integrate chimes without sounding ridiculous. They pull it off well. Another bonus: songs flow almost seamlessly into one another. This works particularly well with the first two tracks: ""The First Thing to Go"" and ""Unscathed,"" the latter switching gears so dramatically halfway through that I thought they'd fucked up the tracklist. (Actually, the jury is still out on whether this is clever or just irritating). The instrumentation makes a huge difference, too. On ""White Noise,"" jazz piano plays counterpoint to dissonant bursts of guitar. It's a cunning trick of composition which represents what these guys do exceptionally well. Suffice to say, these guys have a lot of potential. On the half-empty tip: certain moments on Darkest Hour (most notably the overblown ""One Too Many Mornings"") are indeed atmospheric, but in that breakup-scene-in-a-teen-movie sort of way. They sound very typical, and can bear a marked resemblance to the emotive rock hits featured on the commercial alternative stations-- those ones by the bands whose names you never remember-- which is aided by singer Eric Schopmeyer's theatrical vocal style. His tenor moans recall college-rock crooners and second-rate Jeff Buckley impersonators, and the breathy, whispered filler is distractingly artificial. This combination evokes the inevitable world-weary tone favored by four out of five sensitive teenagers with black-framed glasses. It would be something special if it hadn't been done before. But it has. And it isn't. Significant orchestral arrangements can occasionally bolster an otherwise simplistic sound, but I'm not entirely sure Slackjaw is ready for a grand opus. The inclusion of unusual instrumentation can also smack of self-importance, and middling songwriter skills. Part of me that wishes someone hadn't complied with the probable studio command to ""make it bigger."" There are very few artists in the world that can pull off full-tilt album rock pretension. For all I know, Slackjaw may arise as saviors of rock and roll-- after all, stranger things have happened-- but Darkest Hour isn't going to get them there. And one further note: wearing your influences on your sleeve only works if you deviate from the formula. With the possible exception of ""White Noise,"" every song on here sounds like a tribute to another band. From Radiohead on ""The First Thing to Go"" to American Analog Set on ""All That Remains"" (dead ringer). That Slackjaw perform with some agility is of secondary concern, because ultimately it's sort of boring.","When I received Slackjaw's Darkest Hour, my first reaction was to groan and construct a lengthy laundry list of ...

Fear and Whiskey,Mekons,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41bc0084474cd0c35fd/1:1/w_160/c9b98cec.jpg,2002-03-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5208-fear-and-whiskey/,SinSin,"So it turns out this is a stone-cold masterpiece. Who knew? It's been out of print for years, but now that it's back, it's being called everything from ""a good set of drinking songs"" to ""the seed that sprouted alt-country"" to ""the greatest rock album in history."" Fear and Whiskey was the first great statement of ""shambolic punk"" band the Mekons, and yes, it is as great as all their rabid fans have always said (though ""the greatest rock album in history"" is, of course, a bit of a stretch). As I was digging through my rock library to figure out what defines a classic, I found an essay by Steve Wynn of the Dream Syndicate, listing his top criteria for what makes a great rock album. The most important factor, he argued, was ""the potential of falling apart at any moment"": not just that the recording sounds rough around the edges, but that the entire band could have careened off the rails at any time. The Mekons, circa 1985, fit that description wonderfully. Though this album took months of planning, Fear and Whiskey sounds as chaotic and spontaneous as any great night at a dance hall full of the reek of stale beer. Just like a live show, almost all you can hear through the record's tinny sound are Steve Goulding's drums-- pounding out a dance beat crossed with a military tattoo-- and Susie Honeyman's fiddle, soaring above, pretty but ragged. Singer/guitarists Tom Greenhalgh and Jon Langford bellow, cheer and grumble through the noise. They sing about booze, they sing about politics, and most of all, they sing about despair: Greenhalgh opens ""Chivalry"" with, ""I was out late the other night/ Fear and whiskey kept me going,"" while the heroic tune from the violin keeps him upright. But let's move past the drinking and look at what it stands for: failure and camaraderie. The Mekons were born in '77 but were all but defunct by the mid-80s; they reunited to play benefit shows for miners during the strike of '84-85. As ""non-aligned lefties,"" the band raged against the Thatcher administration, and watched the suffering of miners who were on strike for a year and then went back to work in defeat. But against that backdrop, Fear and Whiskey doesn't so much as stumble. Every disaster turns into a victory anthem, from Greenhalgh and Langford shouting through ""Hard to Be Human Again,"" to ""Abernant 1984/85,"" which is a glorious waltz no matter how bleak the lyrics (""They seek to destroy us/ How much more is there left to lose?""). The music is a mess of influences united on the bones of punk music. The Mekons always subscribed to the ""anything goes"" rules of Britain's ""Class of '77,"" and Fear and Whiskey is their most famous example: this was the record where they started to assimilate country music. It was a radical move in mid-80s Britain, not least because of the right-wing politics that were associated with the style. Musicologists have labelled this the father of alt-country, that bastard offspring of indie rock and country/western-- though for as much as you hear it on ""Darkness and Doubt"" (complete with a John Wayne reference), or the cover of Hank Williams' hit ""Lost Highway,"" country is just one of the styles jammed in here, along with English folk, Leeds punk, and whatever else was at hand. Anyone who expects scenic Americana will stop short at the second song, ""Trouble Down South,"" a weird mini-drama that would bring a lesser album to its knees: Ken Lite narrates some kind of a military advance over a reggae-inflected drum machine and a wheezing accordion, while soprano Jaqui Callis struggles to hit her highest notes. As far as it fits here at all, it's to force the listener to accept that the Mekons are ready and willing to do whatever they want. No matter how scattershot the first few songs sound, the second half of the album justifies everything. With a ""proper"" band assembled, these last five songs were ""recorded and mixed one fine spring day in 1985,"" and they make up one of the most spontaneous, exciting and perfect album sides ever. For fourteen minutes, from ""Flitcraft"" to ""Lost Highway,"" the Mekons don't touch the ground. This is music that is effortlessly, spontaneously great, with a massive beat that sweeps along grim lyrics like, ""We know that for many years there's been no country here."" But it's right near the end that they play the crowning song, the most perfect part of the album: ""Last Dance,"" a pop song that sounds like it had never been played before that day but where every note falls in place, down to that throwaway guitar solo and Honeyman's beautiful fiddle, so bright it could make you want to cry. The narrator sings about the end of the night, when the music's winding down and it's time to search the room for someone to take home. The lyrics are resigned to failure, but then there are two lines in the middle-- ""So beautiful, you were waltzing/ Little frozen rivers all covered in snow""-- sung by a man whose desire stretches his capacity for eloquence: he could have just seen the woman he'll marry. And he probably goes home alone. The Mekons didn't stand on the brink of collapse because they chose to; they accepted the knowledge that everything could be ripped from their hands. The Thatcher administration could declare war on the people; the miners could lose the strike. You could get one great night out of hundreds of bad ones, and for those fleeting moments you grab whatever you can-- even if it's just a handful of rowdy old songs.","So it turns out this is a stone-cold masterpiece.

Lost in Revelry,The Mendoza Line,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42e13d197565213becb/1:1/w_160/e1b6024d.jpg,2002-03-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5225-lost-in-revelry/,Misra,"""Who rocks the house? The Saxons rock the house! And when the Saxons rock the house, they rock it all the way down!"" --Langley High School Cheerleading Team Not only were the Langley Saxon cheerleaders hot and slutty, but they were also unwitting soothsayers-- who ever could have predicted that Saxons of the future would so thoroughly rock the house? But in the early 1990s, they did. As grunge exploded nationwide, Langley's Auxiliary Gym played host to a different sort of musical explosion: the limitless pyrotechnic excitement of the Battle of the Bands. At Langley, however, each event seemed much less a ""battle"" than a small episode in a never-ending ""War of the Bands,"" as fierce ""Skirmishes of the Bands"" seemed to break out almost every weekend, usually on the same hotly contested turf, and for the same rich $50.00 bounty. Among the regulars in Langley's War of the Bands were stalwart cover artists Spook Jacobs, whose flawless version of Van Halen's ""Jump"" was the weekly neutron bomb that obliterated all other contestants, including, appropriately enough, Ground Zero, featuring the powerful, androgynous tenor of ""Handsome"" Dan Sheridan. There were also the King Fahds, with their indie flair, underdog attitude, and mediocre songwriting ability. In true indie fashion, the King Fahds never won shit. Spook Jacobs, on the other hand, won both shit and fame, piling up victories well into the mid-to-late 90s. One would have thought that, at the minimum, Spook would be staring at a sweet recording deal by now. But alas, they had to settle for merely regional conquest. Of those not shamed into radioactive dust by the Spooks' atomic force were two graduates of Langley's class of 1991, Tim Bracy and Pete Hoffman (who undoubtedly remember all three bands), and a part-time contributor to their band, and likewise Langley alum, Paul Deppler. As far as I know, none of them ever enlisted in the War. So much the better. Instead, Bracy and Hoffman created their own musical insurgency, an indie pop outfit known as the Mendoza Line. Now on their fourth LP, the Mendoza Line has gained a reputation for rootsy, melody-driven pop/rock. That reputation certainly won't change with Lost in Revelry, but as long as they're being formulaic, they're doing a fine job. The majority of the album's highlights come courtesy of the songwriting tandem of Bracy and Hoffman, whose maturity as songsmiths is notable-- this record is consistently concise, punchy and poignant. The album's superb populist clap-along opener, ""A Damn Good Disguise,"" stands out as the best song on the disc, and is emblematic of the Mendoza Line's sound; two parts Westerberg, one part Wilco. The band shifts into a lower gear for ""The Triple Bill of Shame,"" a raspy, rustic tune that delivers a heap of emotion and a load of nifty rhymes (""And you were once of interest/ To the nightly news and the daily press/ But now that you've outlived your uselessness/ Do you know what doesn't happen next?/ They all call you by your number, they won't call you by your name/ On the triple bill of shame""). Mendoza compadre Shannon Mary McArdle doesn't fare quite as well. McArdle, who first appeared on 1999's I Like You When You're Not Around, plays a more prominent role on Lost in Revelry, writing five songs for the album, and singing lead vocals on each of them. Great as a backup vocalist, McArdle could use a little help with the guitar and pen. A few of her songs are decent (""Red Metal Doors""), but others, like the quasi-country of ""Something Dark,"" and the snore-along ""I'm That!""

The Only Reason I Feel Secure EP,Pedro the Lion,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fdb1335d7bf16983bc/1:1/w_160/f5c6e9ee.jpg,2002-03-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6212-the-only-reason-i-feel-secure-ep/,Made in MexicoMade in Mexico,"At any house party, at any given time, there's a person who has isolated himself in one of the rooms, alone with a guitar. Sure, there's a revolving fanbase whose ranks are refreshed by the ever-circulating mass of people listening in hushed awe, but the only constant is the guitar player... and his is the loneliest of lives. His music is considered a ""buzzkill,"" as it generally reflects his disillusionment with the politics of the social world and will temporarily permeate the euphoric ambience of any who dare enter the room for a song. Somewhere along the way, David Bazan made the decision that life outside that room just wasn't worth the toll it took on the soul. Now he permanently resides there, subtly sermonizing to any who'll listen. Throughout the course of Pedro the Lion's career, Bazan has kept his arrangements relatively sparse, and The Only Reason I Feel Secure certainly didn't make any attempt to break from that tradition upon its initial Made in Mexico release. The EP, comprised of five songs dealing with ""criticism"" of all things, first introduced Bazan's self-defeating love for conceptualist departure which would be fully realized on his 30-minute opus Winners Never Quit. Now that the band has jumped ship from Made in Mexico, their back catalog is getting the Jade Tree treatment, complete with repackaging and, in the case of The Only Reason I Feel Secure, the inclusion of a few bonus tracks. Though the EP's re-release certainly won't galvanize the industry, it remains the definitive litmus test for those unfamiliar with Pedro's Eitzel-esque song structures and valium-induced contemplations on life. Much fuss is unnecessarily made of Bazan's Christian leanings. Luckily, Pedro the Lion have always been reasonable, lyrically speaking. Rather than openly addressing the Christian God, they opt to lament through ambiguity which occasionally yields some awkwardly worded sentiments. Still, there's something disarming, even from an objectivist's standpoint, about the disparity and wide-eyed inquiry in lyrics like, ""I hear that you don't change/ How do you expect to keep up with the trends/ You won't survive the information age."" This, coupled with the somber arrangement of ""Letter from a Concerned Follower,"" makes for one of the disc's better moments. If not for former labelmate Damien Jurado's similarly charred pipes and thematic offerings, Pedro the Lion could easily escape on the potency of their lyrics. However, it seems that everything Bazan tries to accomplish on The Only Reason has already been done before, albeit better. So if you consider yourself a fan of the Lion, do yourself a favor and go pick up Jurado's Rehearsals for Departure. Oh, and pretty much anything by American Music Club. Ex-Pitchforker Zach Hooker gave The Only Reason I Feel Secure a slightly overwhelming 8.4 upon its initial release. Purism be damned, but there's something that just doesn't bode well about an EP that boasts a whopping total of three new tracks (one being a live interpretation of ""Invention,"" a song found earlier on the record), a lyrics sheet, and an inflated price. The slightly abridged The Only Reason is still widely available and isn't nearly as much of a strain on your pocketbook. Both make for the perfect accompaniment to that 4:00am disillusionment that has occasionally claimed us all. Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between, and Bazan's output just doesn't sport the same underlying complexity as contemporaries Red House Painters, Will Oldham, and other such artists whose music is often denoted by meditations in the same mood. Pedro the Lion hail from Nathaniel Hawthorne's America. This is what wayward Puritans would headbang to. Satan has invariably given us greater musical gifts, but for those introverts facing more exalted theological issues, The Only Reason I Feel Secure fits like a tailored rosary. Of course, life back then was stark and simple, and the Lion make no qualms about the utter incomplexity of their work. Though it cuts down on extraneous and unnecessary accompaniment, it also makes for a complete lack of surprise when Bazan unsheathes the old verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge formula song after song. It's funny, though, that emo, a genre obviously begat by Beelzebub himself, finds so many of its contributions inspired by the word of God.","At any house party, at any given time, there's a person who has isolated himself in one of the ...

Nothing Down-to-Earth,Galerie Stratique,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bedfc0084474cd0c2f55/1:1/w_160/ac098178.gif,2002-03-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3383-nothing-down-to-earth/,Law and Auder,"Nothing Down-to-Earth is an accurate description of Charles-Émile Beullac's maiden voyage under the Galerie Stratique guise. Beullac describes his work as misty-abstract electronica, which sets up loathsome images of an airbrushed future as envisioned by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. But no matter what brickbats Beullac throws, you should head straight for the album-- it's the most refreshing pure-IDM album I've heard since Ulrich Schnauss' Far Away Trains Passing By was released late last year. Nothing Down-to-Earth is so complete an album that I can't possibly condone Law and Auder even thinking about commissioning a remix record. Beullac distinguishes himself by being concise and true to himself. He's self-assured enough not to leap on any bandwagon or to pay more than passing lip service to current software and styles. Nothing Down-to-Earth is therefore starkly bereft of post-Autechre laptop crunch and Schematic glitch. Beullac's beats are not entities removed from the drifting spaciness of his ambience; he's integrated them into the texture of his pieces, and thereby released them from just signifying rhythmic units. This approach to beat-programming reminds me of the time of Autechre's Tri Repetae. Nothing Down-to-Earth additionally derives its ambivalent complex-simple style from Global Communications' 76.14 and Reload's A Collection of Short Stories. As a result, anyone expecting Beullac to be a bleeding-edge member of the Montreal electronic scene will find this album wistfully nostalgic. By the same token, if you're up for some almost forgotten Artificial Intelligence and Headphone listening, Nothing Down-to-Earth delivers in spades. With the opener, ""Star Filter,"" Beullac begins as he means to go on. The song is a delicately echoed drift through dust motes. ""Algeria"" follows, mutating the first track's theme with a middle-eastern inflected variant. As the track builds tension, repeating the melody line and adding incrementally more oppressive percussion, Beullac releases a powerful analog bass drone to maintain order. Still, an alien countermelody soon appears and challenges all other elements for dominance. ""Leviathan"" is the first piece that borrows from the processed Burundi-style drumming that Jon Hassell and Brian Eno used for their seminal and visionary Possible Music. Beullac gives his polyrhythms prominence and uses dark ambient tones to infuse ""Leviathan"" with a looming, monstrous quality that justifies its title. ""Frozen Lakes"" reprises the echoing chimes of ""Star Filter,"" but as it's three times as long, Beullac has the opportunity to add a nomadic melodica line. I find ""Frozen Lakes"" an inappropriate title, because the music is far more fluid than I'd expect from a piece with this name. It's the melodica line that connotes for me distance and yearning, and within the context of this piece, my third eye imagines wandering through the heatless vastness of space. Or perhaps I've been listening to too many Augustus Pablo records to appreciate any other situation for a melodica. Inevitably, Nothing Down-to-Earth cannot escape the influence of the Boards of Canada. Though ""Rylka"" borrows its naïve melody from Music Has the Right to Children, Beullac distinguishes the track by adding some Burundi-by-way-of-Possible Music percussion. ""Luna"" begins as a reworking of Albinoni's ""Adagio"" for Orb devotees, but Beullac breaks out his melodica for another mournful trip across the universe. ""Opale"" is bass-heavy master class in getting away with gauzy, pitch-slipping hooks just as the fuzzed-out cathedral organ of ""Soleil Levant"" demonstrates what the Phantom of the Opera would play if he'd been studying Brian Wilson and Aphex Twin. The phantasmagoric and elegant four minutes of ""Soleil Levante"" are what Simian spent their entire debut album trying to create. The sound picture that Beullac paints here is not the trite image of sun rising that the Beatles did with ""Here Comes the Sun."" Beullac's sun is unmistakably more Gnostic, more order of the Golden Dawn than George Harrison's happy-go-lucky vision. Perpetuating Beullac's shrouded, disquieting style, ""Dictaphone"" is a Namlook-like sequencer piece, disrupted by static bursts and garbled speech. Again, my third eye is overstimulated. Beullac's ""Dictaphone"" is like the forties-futurist office supplies in Alex Proyas' Dark City. Nothing Down-to-Earth is as complete a debut as I've heard in ages. Unless you're looking for innovation, there's nothing here that won't amaze you. Yes, you've heard some of these textures before, and yes, Beullac borrows from predecessors. But I never lost Beullac in this album. His uniqueness is the background radiation of the universe of Nothing Down-to-Earth. Too many debuts submerge individuality in order to emulate (and therefore become part of) canonical IDM releases. Though Beullac's debut may not receive the plaudits it manifestly deserves because of its unwillingness to pay homage to Reaktor's latest upgrade or the mandates of the style council of the IDM listserv, I am over the moon with it.","Nothing Down-to-Earth is an accurate description of Charles-\xC9mile Beullac's\n\ maiden voyage under the Galerie Stratique guise.

Nuggets: Luke Vibert's Selection,Luke Vibert,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95113d1975652139845/1:1/w_160/88ba4062.gif,2002-03-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8461-nuggets-luke-viberts-selection/,Lo,"When one thinks of the early days of electronic music, one often imagines some crazy old professor locked up in a lab, communicating with a machine the size of a house, churning out something illogical and strange which no one but the most die-hard of avant-gardists would ever hear. But this was not always the case. Take Raymond Scott, for example, a maverick mind who made music with computers in the 1950s-60s. Whether or not you know his name, you've heard his music. His short compositions served as the score for everything from Twinkies commercials to Marvin the Martian cartoons. Such was the fate of most early electronic artists. Though their names may never be known by anyone but the most obsessive music nerds, their work will live on, both in its random appearances in popular culture and in the effect it had on artists of today. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Scott and others like him toiled away in relative obscurity, making short pieces, the rights to which would often later be purchased by television producers. Recent years have seen enterprising record labels filing through the vaults of this so-called Library Music. Recent compilations like Motel Records' Cinemaphonic Soul Punch series, Strut UK's Music for Dancefloors: The Cream of the Chapell Music Library Sessions, and Manhattan Research-- Basta Records' compilation of recently unearthed recordings by Scott-- showcased an amazing array of music, all far-ahead of its time, and most of it steeped in anonymity. Half the fun of this music, of course, lies with that air of familiarity. Even if you've never heard the particular song before, it has a feel that's similar to the music you've been hearing all your life without ever knowing it. Nuggets: Luke Vibert's Selection is Lo Recordings' stab at the Library Music compilation market. Comprised largely from works by French musicians Nino Nardini, Roger Roger and Eddie Warner (who are also billed as Peter Bonello, Cecil Leuter and Georges Teperino, respectively), Nuggets is a collection of short psychedelic tunes pulling equally from the realms of funk, rock and jazz, with heavy doses of synths and delays. And to help you justify dropping your well-earned dollars, the fine folks at Lo even included Vibert's name on the package. But it's actually more than a marketing ploy. Vibert's actually a pretty logical choice as curator. This is the sort of stuff he's been sampling in his work for years. Apparently, Juicy Luke himself spent a few weeks digging through a series of archives to compile this disc, most of which has never seen release to the general public. Much like Vibert's recordings as Wagon Christ, the music on Nuggets tends to walk that fine line between funky/danceable and too-goofy-for-its-own-good. And also like his music, there are moments which suffer from mediocrity, but those moments where everything meshes are strong enough to make up for it. Luckily, these tracks are short and well-sequenced enough to make up for any dull moments. Look at the way Epstein and Kraman's utterly silly ""Turkish Delight"" (which consists of a escalating keyboard pattern, scatting vocals manipulated to sound like a child and complimentary synth horns and vibes) comes after the straightforward funk of Richard Demaria's ""Next Episode"" (which seems pulled right out of a Coldcut Solid Steel mix). Or the way Georges Teperino's forward moving 70s-action-show-theme-song-esque ""Cleopatra"" follows the lazy day introspection of Nardini's 33-second ""Soft Bossa"" (which, with softly strummed guitars, warm strings and a lush female vocal, sounds exactly like its name implies) and the repetitive synthlines and drum machine that make up Boneschi Electronic Combo's somewhat boring ""The Bungler."" Or the way short tracks like Bonello's ""Electronic Track 10,"" David Holland's ""Zouche Drums 3"" (both of which were made with percussion only) and Nardini's cheesy ""Bumbling Along"" break up longer numbers like the Johanna Group's excellent ""Strange Love Action,"" a song that's equal parts acoustic guitar noodling, pseudo-Musique Concrète-style electronic sounds, avant-garde strings, and 70s rock cliché medley. Or Jack Arel/Pierre Dutour's ""Sundown,"" which contrasts the sparseness of strings and handdrums with the fullness of synth-generated horn, piano and drum fanfares. The best tracks here meld the experimental electronics with decidedly accessible pop music, making the new and foreign approachable. Eddie Warner's ""Telex"" incorporates the beeping of a telegram with a slow-but-pleasant pop structure. Built around a simple drum machine pattern, Roger Roger's ""Frantique"" begins and ends with a deep but simple keyboard melody that trades parts with heavily distorted cymbals. But somewhere in the middle, a frantic (eh? eh?) guitar part breaks in, followed by ambient electronic noodling that circles around the effected cymbals for a minute or so before bringing us back to earth. Other tracks try the same trick with less success. ""Pots and Pans,"" by A. King/J. Matthews, seems like a Musique Concrète piece thrown on top of a funk song, with no thought given to where the two parts match. Call it an exercise in Cageian chance music, if you wish. Me, I call it clunky and difficult. Still, most of these tracks are worthwhile, if at times a bit silly. But it's a safe bet that anyone drawn to this disc by Vibert's name won't mind a little kookiness, just as it's a safe bet you've never heard any of these tracks before. Even if, at times, it sounds like you have.","When one thinks of the early days of electronic music, one often imagines some\n\ crazy old professor locked up ...

The Process of Belief,Bad Religion,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f09d034d5c69bf2a95/1:1/w_160/997156c9.jpg,2002-03-05 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/520-the-process-of-belief/,Epitaph,"I know what you expect from this review, and you should be ashamed of yourself. None of you readers are actually sitting there thinking, ""Hmm, I wonder if that new Bad Religion album is worth buying. I'll see what Pitchfork says about it."" Of course not. You're all like a bunch of sharks circling around a freshly thrown bucket of chum. You want to see blood. You want to see gore. You want to see your friendly neighborhood elitist thoroughly skewering a band long past its prime. Well, tough. I'm not gonna give it you. And I do this not out of any moral or ethical standard, but rather because I am a Writer of Fine Literature disguised as humble little record reviews, and resorting to such a predictable course is beneath me. Sure, The Process of Belief serves up enough Slo-Pitch softballs for me to spend a thousand words hitting wiseacre home runs. This is, after all, a band of fortysomethings playing music more appropriate to kids struggling with puberty and Algebra. It's an album where the first entity thanked in the liner notes is ""all punks everywhere."" It's an album with a song called ""Kyoto Now!"" which actually, honest to god, contains a ""Turning Japanese"" Oriental-style riff and the lyric, ""You might not think there's any wisdom in a fucked up punk rock song."" But you know, I find it strangely reassuring that Bad Religion sounds exactly the same as when I last heard them, sometime around 1994's Stranger Than Fiction. Now, this could be because The Process of Belief marks the return of guitarist ""Mr."" Brett Gurewitz from behind his executive's desk at Epitaph, but I kinda don't think so. Like death and taxes, one thing you can count on in this world is that most Bad Religion songs are going to use a combination of rapid-fire power chords, snare and bass-heavy drums, 25¢-word machine gun vocals, and those creepy synthetic-sounding harmonies. Honestly, if you can turn off your frontal lobe and forget that you've heard songs like this forty or fifty times before from Bad Religion, there's a few piping hot tracks to be found in The Process of Belief. On occasion, Gurewitz and singer Greg Graffin continue to show strong hook-writing ability, as with the front-loaded old-school drag racers ""Supersonic"" and ""Can't Stop It."" And if you slowed down ""Evangeline"" to half-speed, the result would be the best Weezer song of the last six years. Furthermore, nothing makes a case for Bad Religion sticking to their thematic guns like the sporadic (and rather hilarious) attempts to stretch their sound. The reggae-punk of ""Sorrow,"" for example, hasn't been considered adventurous since around the time of my birth late in the Carter administration. Obvious pleas for radio play, like the mid-tempo and acoustic-flavored ""Broken,"" make you feel a little sorry for the band and their memories of brief mid-nineties alt-rock stardom (sing it: ""You and me-ee/ Have a disea-ease!"") Most of the album, however, is indistinguishable from anything post-No Control, and sounds like it could've been released any time in the last twelve years of the band's history. The question would be, then, is the Bad Religion formula still relevant? I'm going to take a shocking stance here and say, ""Yup."" Hear me out. Back when I was concerned about such things, I used to have a theory that punk rock split, at some undetermined point, into two camps: goofy punk about girls and food (i.e. the Descendents) and political punk about socialism and governmental corruption (i.e. Bad Religion). Over the past few years, it's become apparent that the goofy punks won, with the Green Day/Blink-182/Sum 41 lineage remaining the only commercially viable branch on the punk rock family tree. Political punk, as far as I know, has all but disappeared (is Propagandhi still around?), leaving only its great grandpappy to carry the torch for educating our nation's youth about petrochemical conspiracies. Therefore, I think discovering Bad Religion and their Chomsky for Dummies rhetoric is an important experience for a youth in his/her formative musical years. Sure, their politics are a little flimsy and idealistic (the line ""when all soldiers lay their weapons down"" would make even a 1967 Haight-Ashbury drum circle queasy), but Graffin's lyrics at least can plant questions in a seventh grader's brain more profound than whether that girl in study hall likes him. And it's all delivered in the kind of sugar-high sonic package that speaks most directly to the age range in question. So buy a copy of The Process of Belief for your little brother, or niece, or Boy Scout Troop. Chances are, they'll probably enjoy it a lot more than Fennesz, and you'll be setting them on a path towards heightened musical and political awareness. Bad Religion, I salute you.","I know what you expect from this review, and you should be ashamed of yourself. None of you readers are ...

3 Pieces for Violin EP,Warren Ellis,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc55c0084474cd0c2a7d/1:1/w_160/ffe3a63a.gif,2002-03-04 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2761-3-pieces-for-violin-ep/,King Crab,"There's some kind of magic in Australia's Dirty Three. It's now well-established that the records they make together are great, but just as interesting is how much they bring to projects outside the band. Each member's instrumental style is both unique and extremely portable. Jim White and Mick Turner work together beautifully as a freelance rhythm section on records with the likes of Cat Power and Will Oldham, and on the evidence of the one seven-inch I have, they also shine when they collaborate as the Tren Brothers (""Kit's Choice"" is incredibly affecting). Meanwhile, violinist Warren Ellis has kept busy working on film scoring projects, along with playing with Nick Cave, among others. The 3 Pieces for Violin EP is his first solo record, as well as one of the first releases on Mick Turner's King Crab label. And keeping with the trend, it's superb. Actually, the genesis of these pieces was also collaboration, this time with Canadian dance company Holy Body Tattoo. These three short tracks were originally a sonic backdrop to a piece called Circa, but don't worry, you don't need to be staring at stone-faced automatons in lyrca body stockings to enjoy the music. All serve as a fine showcase for Ellis' highly physical violin style, which moves easily between earthy folk and contemporary classical textures. The latter is display on the first piece, in which a jarring, fiercely sawed opening with sharp edges of dissonance develops into an eerie, slithering melody with several overdubbed violins. As heard on Whatever You Love, You Are's ""I Offered It Up to the Stars and the Night Sky,"" Ellis has a real knack for layering his violin parts, imparting a chamber music feel without forgoing his aggressive tone. The second track finds Ellis heading in the direction of drone music. As one fiddle bows furiously on a single string, giving a rumbling undercurrent not unlike some of Cale's viola work with the Velvet Underground, he uses another track to spread an ethereal, almost Celtic melody on top. Track three is more relaxed and contemplative, starting with a plucked chord and then adding the kind of yearning, poignant lead line that Stradivarius designed the instrument for. His thick tone is certainly one of Ellis' calling cards, but his brilliant melodic sense is what makes his music so memorable, in and out of his main band. Even though 3 Pieces for Violin adds up to only 16 minutes of music, it's close to an essential purchase for Dirty Three fans.","There's some kind of magic in Australia's Dirty Three.

While on the road, bassist Norm Sundholm, appalled by the lack of volume available from his bass cabinet, contacts brother Conrad Sundholm to help him with a solution. 1964: While the state of Indiana bans the Kingsmens' hit ""Louie Louie"" from the radio, citing suspected obscenities in the aforementioned ""unintelligible lyrical rendition"" (a case which FBI head J. Edgar Hoover himself would take up and not drop until 1965), Conrad Sundholm creates the world's first high-powered concert bass amplifier. 1965: An increased interest in the amplifiers leads to increased orders from guitarists and bassists alike, prompting Conrad to move the operation out of his Father's garage. The Sunn amplifier company is born. 1969: Sunn amplifiers are used for the famed monstrous sound system at the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair in upstate New York. ""The SUNNO))) mission is to create trance like soundscapes with the ultimate low end/bottom frequencies intended to massage the listeners intestines into an act of defecation."" Before forming this band in honor of Earth, the powerful drone/doom outfit who somehow released four albums on Sub Pop while maintaining a higher doom:drone ration than any other band from the Northwest, Steve O'Malley and Greg Anderson did time in Burning Witch and Goatsnake, respectively. But SUNNO))) is a different beast entirely, a dual homage to the two things that count: bravado and volume. Flight of the Behemoth is fifty minutes of well-calculated doomdrone that, in one swift take, manages to sound slower than Sleep, more hypnotic than Sabbath, and ten times more powerful than any early 60s NYC drone music (John Cale, Tony Conrad, etc.), and for one simple reason: it's based on metal. The opening track, ""Death Becomes You,"" does not fade in. It kicks the fucking door open and does not stop riffing every so slightly until the end of its thirteen minutes when it crackles out with the sound of a chorus of crackling, speakerkilling malfunctions. ""Mocking Solemnity"" follows, employing similar tactics, save for some extra feedback and a bit more high-end. ""SunnO)))BOW 1"" and ""SunnO)))BOW 2"" are extremely well-fortified remixes of SUNN O))) tracks by Masami Akita, who you might know better by his alias, Merzbow. Merzbow steps in on top of these tracks, and, his match met the by low-end sludgemasters present in the mix, decides to liven the tracks up with some plunking piano in the left channel, accompanied by signature high-end noise bursts in the right. The second remix ends in a terrifying swirl of noise and bass which comes pretty close to the SUNNO))) mission referenced above. Needless to say, the addition of Merzbow to these tracks is very welcome. The final track, entitled ""FWTBT: (I dream of Lars Ulrich being thrown the bus window instead of my master Mystikall Kliff Burton),"" starts out with what sounds like a detuned 808 kickdrum hit, before it melts savagely into a furious and panting repetition of the previous track's nicely executed M.O. Add some faint drumming and some overtly breathy ""singing"" and you have what sounds like a Sabbath song with all the tricks focused in one place, stretched out over ten minutes, without the imagery necessary to propel you straight downward. When I first heard Sleep's ""Jerusalem,"" I thought that the ultimate in slowness and deliberation had been reached, that it would not be possible to transcend the completely stoned realm of Nazareth that the hour-long concept album champions. Obviously, I wasn't looking hard enough. This album sounds like it could have been recorded ten miles away from Woodstock while it was happening, with special microphones buried ten miles below the surface of the earth to only catch the vibrations of the bass on stage and the pounding of all those hippies doing whatever the hell it was they were doing. The trajectory that begins with Richard Berry and ends with Merzbow leaves me wondering what J. Edgar Hoover would have thought of this album. And then I remember that he was a crossdresser.","Sunn O))), an incidental history:

There Are No New Clouds,Ides of Space,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1a8abf31b7dc7156668/1:1/w_160/a3e0351f.jpg,2002-03-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4058-there-are-no-new-clouds/,Better Looking,"Well, here's a blast from my past. Kind of, anyway. If you'd just thrown this disc on and asked me where and when it was played, I would have guessed Manchester, England, 1992 without giving it much thought. And I probably would have wondered how such a good little shoegazer record had managed to elude me as I swept the genre clean several years ago. You see, big, swirly, noisy British rock was the music that finally broke my close-minded assumption that no one had made any good music after the 70s. And once I found it, I dove in deep, scooping up all the Ride albums I could find and hunting down all of the elusive Boo Radleys records and EPs I could find. If asked, I could produce a pretty massive stack of discs that fit at least vaguely in the category, from acknowledged classics like Loveless to obscurities like a 14 Iced Bears compilation. Of course, Ides of Space's debut album wasn't recorded in 1992, nor in Manchester, England. Rather, it's just an anachronism from Sydney, Australia. And damned if I don't love it. I suppose it's my lot to like an album like this, given the special place this kind of music has in my heart. But while I love it, I have to face facts-- There Are No New Clouds breaks no new ground whatsoever and the ground it does tread is already beaten halfway to death. ""This Side of the Screen"" opens the album with clean guitars and crisp drums that could have come straight off of Ride's Nowhere. Patrick Haid intones in a heavily accented tenor and gets through most of a verse before the inevitable wall of distortion blasts in from both speakers and wraps everything in a dense fuzz. ""Arthur's Car"" follows with a much brisker rhythm and mostly clean guitars, opting instead to allow Martin Barker's keyboards to fill in the spaces that would normally be occupied by noise. Haid's voice is doubled over the top, delivering a strong melody in a tone reminiscent of some of American indiedom's tweer elements, like Witch Hazel and Spectacle. From there, the band blasts through eight other blissed-out nuggets, most of which would have been worthy of an NME Single of the Week column about a decade ago. At this point, though, they're simply enjoyable, and I think the quality of the music says something for the band. The way they play and write, it's hard to believe they've only been together for two years. The melodies are well developed and the playing is technically flawless, yet rough enough to sound real. The only consistently unpredictable timbre is Barker's keyboard, but the Ides vary the feels and tempos enough that the songs don't blur together. ""Random Noise Generator"" ably displays the band's tightness and skill with its switch from a quiet, slow, spacy intro into a quick-paced rocker with an impressive instrumental breakdown in the middle. The band builds toward a climax but instead stops short with a brief silence before blasting back into the verse. The device is a little less effective when repeated for the outro, but they vary the approach slightly by filling the silence with a delay-drenched keyboard and cropping the buildup. Guitarist Mark Ayoub serves up some appealing, if highly derivative, lead parts to counterbalance Haid's airy lead vocal on ""I Promise Not to Notice If You Promise to Pretend."" The rhythm section of brothers Anthony and David The hits particularly hard on this song, too, laying down a solid, driving foundation for the other members' more skyward aspirations. It's followed by ""Computer World,"" which, though unfortunately not a surprise Kraftwerk cover, offers a good look at the band's facility with slower, quieter songs. Beginning with sparse guitar strumming and a distant keyboard drone that wouldn't sound terribly out of place on an old Talk Talk or recent Hood record, it evolves into a windswept ballad that makes good use of space between instruments and notes, only opting to fill it with loud distortion near the very end. Part of what makes this album so successful is the guiding hand of producer Wayne Connolly, who sees to it that, no matter how loud or noisy it is, no one part overwhelms any of the others in a way that it shouldn't. In addition to being well and confidently played, this album even sounds good. This record isn't really for everybody, though-- if you're not already a convert to the shoegazer aesthetic, this won't be the disc that changes your mind. But despite the fact that it doesn't really do anything that original, there's plenty of good stuff to be found here, and There Are No New Clouds, while an unintentionally accurate title, at the very least reveals a young band with scads of potential. If they came this far in two years, imagine where they'll be after two more.","Well, here's a blast from my past. Kind of, anyway. If you'd just thrown this disc on and ...

TransHuman Revolution,Barcelona,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21313d19756521387a8/1:1/w_160/61f2dbde.gif,2002-03-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/558-transhuman-revolution/,DarlapulCec,"Darla Records' James Agren had to put down his vegan tofu wrap just to make sure he'd read the email right. Barcelona were breaking up? What a bummer. Not only were they one of the main bands on the pulCec imprint, they'd basically written Darla's website. Nobody else had a sound quite like theirs-- some people had taken to calling it ""programmer pop,"" what with the keyboard melodies and all the references to computers and software and stuff. Of course, they had taken to writing some stock songs like ""Teenage Pop Star"" lately. The keyboard intro soared like any classic new wave cut, and the boy-girl harmony was cute, but what was with the chorus? ""Gonna be a teenage one-hit washed-up messed-up megalomaniac""-- yet the song sounded like it could be a Saturday morning cartoon intro! Anyway, they would be missed. Jeff couldn't believe the news about Barcelona. He didn't like much synth-pop, but the jangling guitars gave these guys a rocking sound. They didn't use a drum machine, either-- it was all live. Who else was going to write songs like ""I Have the Password to Your Shell Account""?! When he saw that song title on Napster back in the day, he thought it was a joke. And Jennifer Carr, whoa-- brains, beauty and a good voice. She could take his server down any day. It didn't make any sense, the new album was just as good as all the others. ""West Coast Radio"" was like a Beach Boys song for the digital age, with Jason Korzen singing about some intimidating California girl and Carr cooing backing vocals. The album art was cool, too-- images of robots with serving trays Photoshopped into pictures of African natives. It was something conceptual about primitives and futurists. But he had to get back to work; the figures for the next round of missile tests needed to be in by five. Trevor Kampmann had seen it coming. All his engineering work couldn't do much for a song like ""The Power of Jen."" The surf riff wasn't much different than the Cult's ""She Sells Sanctuary,"" and Jen Carr insisted on singing something twee about boys who kept calling her. The chorus was total fluff: ""J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R."" Ugh. They'd written some really great songs for the album, though. ""Human Simulation"" bleeped along with its buzzy Casio keyboards, and Carr's soaring ""I'd give you anything that you want"" was irresistible. They really should have put her in front of the mic more often. Most of the songs featured Korzen on main vocals, and his delivery was just too forced. Cameron Crowe was a fan, and he'd helped them to decide the final sequencing, but they couldn't seem to put together enough songs to last half an hour. They may have perfected their style, but all the mid-tempo rhythms didn't make for much excitement, and the guitar tone tended to slip into monotony. Sarah sat back from her iMac. She'd just imagined a two-song suite. It began with a minute-and-a-half-long instrumental, ""April 1978,"" which featured a gently rolling beat and a guitar pinging at the high registers sentimentally. That would serve as an introduction to ""I Get the Message,"" another slow ballad that didn't descend into cliché. Some lyrics even popped up in her head: ""Radio waves reflect across the screen/ Terminal haze, your transmission's beamed/ I feel the impact from the satellite that's calling me."" Later on, maybe she'd have somebody going ""bah-dah, dah-dah"" over and over again, like a verbal expression of those lonely radio waves. But then it occurred to her that maybe she was spending way too much time at rockstargame.com. It was fun to watch her little automatons write the same songs over and over, and ""Everything Makes Me Think About Sex"" almost made it to hit single. But it was clear that a indie rock band inspired by silly 80s groups like Sparks probably didn't have a chance to climb to the top, and it wasn't going to get her an 'A' in Logic. Time to get back to work. [Barcelona played its last show in February, 2002.]","Darla Records' James Agren had to put down his vegan tofu wrap just to make sure\n\ he'd read ...

Andexelt,Circle,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d7c0084474cd0c07fd/1:1/w_160/2ee0f936.jpeg,2002-03-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1475-andexelt/,Tumult,"Nothing brings me to crummy stripmalls swifter than crummy used CD marts. I love their $1 bins. I love the dusty stench that manages to conquer the reek of the fried-chicken place next door and wards off all but the most determined diggers. But more than anything, I love these bins because I've discovered so many great records in them. One such gem is Circle's Andexelt. Before Thursday afternoon I knew nothing of this Finnish band, but by the typography that reminded me of Brothomstates' Claro and the mechanized body-part photography that occupies the lowest sixth of the cover, I knew I should punt my buck. After a thirty-minute metro ride home and enough time to brew a pot of coffee, I was ready to try out Andexelt. I'd lined up other discs just in case it, in fact, turned out to be Scandinavian doom metal or a cunning front for an area smooth jazz combo. I needn't have bothered. Andexelt is still in my CD tray days later. The album is pure krautrock and it is the most invigorating collection I've heard since a French Canadian called Charles-Émile sent me his debut album, Nothing Down to Earth. Circle, I googled, are a five-piece who since 1991 have been astounding those just south of the Arctic Circle with their muscular explorations of space, time, and the pan-dimensional mega-riff. Andexelt is their seventh full-length, and you need to hear it often. The record voyages to the same places as Les MacCann's Layers, but takes a different route. Grafting Neu!'s motorik percussion, Berlin-era Bowie synths to Robbie Shakespeare's dubby basslines and riding a guitar wave that recalls Black Sabbath and Michael Karoli, Andexelt surpasses Brainticket's Adventure, and equals Can's Future Days in loaded grace. If this band were well-known, the Chemical Brothers would have already sampled Janne Peltomäki's rhythm-salvo of the opening title track, and music critics at large would already have acknowledged Circle's ferocity. The band's guitarist, Teemu Elo, unloads a double-barreled reverb riff straight in your face, and while you're busy searching for bits of your head, frontman Jussi Lehtisalo's analog synth enters, intent on slicing to ribbons any sounds that cross its path. Fortunately, it's hard labor cutting away at Peltomäki's resilient groove. Elo and Lehtisalo form a cluster-bombing alliance against him, but the man relentlessly motoriks on. For ""Odultept,"" the band jumps on the Fender Rhodes space-jazz and bolsters their move by allowing bassist J. Laiho to showcase his fits-and-starts dub-bass abilities. Guest T. Huunonen gives up a galactic flute solo after an explosion of ARP synths and the band decides to take a tour round the interstellar medium. ""20Milate"" is an Arkestral reworking of My Bloody Valentine's ""You Made Me Realize"" whereas ""Lisääpui"" mines the same Stooges treasury that Julian Cope's Brain Donor project did, except Circle got there first and stole the heavenly guitar line that Agitation Free's liquid-harmony guitarist Lutz Ulbrich had left behind. ""Humusaar"" emerges from a doomy bass ground into a receding, FX-spattered star-field. And the brooding, numinous closer, ""Kidulgos,"" proves that Circle have processed Tangerine Dream's nebulous Zeit as well as the third-eye mantra of Electronic Meditation. Andexelt is astounding, no two ways about it. All it's taken for me to get totally pumped up about this music has been a dollar. Yes, it may be a little more than a 10-10-321 collect call, but in that dusty bin, I found something actually worth talking up to twenty minutes about.","Nothing brings me to crummy stripmalls swifter than crummy used CD marts.

In the Grips of the Light,Racebannon,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d4b1335d7bf1698359/1:1/w_160/c96ff713.jpg,2002-03-03 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6633-in-the-grips-of-the-light/,Jagjaguwar,"When a two-year old flies into a fit of impotent, helpless rage, it can scream its head off. It doesn't even need to say anything or explain itself; it just lets fly. Most adults forget this surefire route to feeling better, but not Mike Anderson. As frontman for the Indiana noise-core band Racebannon, Anderson shrieks and gibbers almost unintelligibly, crumpling the words like fast food wrappers in a muck-clogged gutter. The listener hears it just as sound, but if you look up the lyrics in the liner notes, they're clear and succinct-- for example: ""Yr ability to head face first into the dirt has taught you nothing but how to get lost in this open field of market and value. I've got heartburn. I can't pay my goddamn rent."" Hey, I can relate to that. Can I scream too? Anderson's vocal geekshow and the band's artsy leanings set Racebannon apart from your average angry hardcore band. They're a rock quartet that can rip through fast, high thrash. But while the songs usually start loud and spastic, most of them run long-- half are over eight minutes-- and the extended writing, the interesting use of sounds, and the effective cover of Captain Beefheart's ""Electricity"" suggest there's an art band behind the violent facade. Like the vocals, the guitars smear and spray as often as they make statements. The rhythm section plays solid hardcore but it can also play freeform, as with the scattered hi-hats on ""I'm Yr Egomaniac."" Racebannon also throw in effects, theremin, and on ""Egomaniac,"" some kind of bells or chiming glass sound. Fortunately, Racebannon never loses intensity no matter how long or complicated the music becomes. Even the shorter songs like ""Flip n' Fuck"" or ""Fuck Yr Obvious Words"" transition from screaming thrash to effect-stricken outros, but the opening sections are strong enough to keep the rest of the song from wandering. On the other hand, the best songs acquire an awesome magnitude as they ramble on. ""Clubber Lang"" kicks off with a great guitar riff and digs solidly into position behind Anderson's rant; as it jerks through the noises and gizmos of the ending, Anderson trails off into the distance. The most interesting song on the album, the closer ""I'm Yr Egomaniac,"" builds dramatically with slow drones and the hi-hats and bell sounds mentioned above, while Anderson spits out an entire monologue. Racebannon won't win over everybody. As the label ""avant-noise-core"" suggests, they tend to push themselves into a niche. Strict hardcore fans might balk at the long songs and instrumental sections, while people who don't dig hardcore at all will have trouble with the lack of melodies, hooks, or approachable beats. The recording is immaculate and surprisingly unabrasive, but it could stand to get messier. (It's also a little shy on the low-end.) You get the impression that the band is heavy, but not very heavy-- angry, but not aggressive. No matter how ferocious and ugly it sounds, the ugliness is happening to somebody else. But on those terms, it's a compelling and original album: there's a lot of appeal to kicking back and listening to these guys spill their troubles and frustrations. You don't even need to catch all the words.","When a two-year old flies into a fit of impotent, helpless rage, it can scream its head off. It doesn ...

Is a Woman,Lambchop,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc89c0084474cd0c2af0/1:1/w_160/1969576f.jpg,2002-03-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4659-is-a-woman/,Merge,"Perhaps I'm missing something. The sixth LP from Lambchop, everyone's favorite Nashville-based quatuordectet (fourteen members-- look it up!), has been released to generally positive murmuring from the bespectacled intelli-rock crowd. To me, this indicates that Kurt Wagner and his Nashville friends have joined that exclusive herd of sacred musical cows, alongside their pals in Yo La Tengo. In the eyes of critics the world over, they seem to have been deemed untouchable. Which is why I feel like I'm going to have my Music Critics Union (Local #462) card revoked when I say Is a Woman is a disappointment. But before you lay down your harsh punishment, oh wise union magistrates, allow me to present the evidence for the album's underwhelming effect upon your humble supplicant. I generally like Lambchop quite a bit. Their last two albums of new stuff, 2000's Nixon and 1998's What Another Man Spills, collected genres like baseball cards and created an easy listening sound that soothed the soul without triggering the gag reflex. As the band's makeshift orchestra performed horn and string swoops worthy of a Vegas-style lounge revue, Wagner's lyrics and off-kilter vocals provided just enough of a wink to indicate we were all in on the joke, and that it was okay to enjoy the music of our grandmothers. (Hey, remember irony?) But from the Vince Guaraldi-like instrumental intro of Is a Women's opening track, ""The Daily Growl,"" it's apparent that the keyword for this outing is ""sparse."" Fourteen people (twenty, if you count guests) have never sounded so quiet; throughout the album, Lambchop sounds less like the orchestra from ""Name That Tune,"" and more like a piano jazz group whose drummer took the night off. Gone, for the most part, is the genre-hopping, the falsetto, the lushness, and the cornet. Dear God, why the cornet?! Dangerously, the new sound would indicate that Wagner is taking himself a whole lot more seriously this time around, to less entertaining effect. While his lyrics still have the ability to provoke many a double-take (by the second song, he's already name-dropped Chicken of the Sea, Intel, and Sherwin-Williams), the delivery is considerably more straightforward: less faux-crooner than actual crooner. Wagner's aspirations to being the Dean Martin or Bing Crosby of indie rock have never been more obvious, and it's further made clear by the disturbingly high prominence of his voice in the mix (think Mark Kozelek on Old Ramon or Bridge). The rest of the band, meanwhile, is largely relegated to the background or the occasional flourish, with the exception of Tony Crow's frequently front-and-center piano. Admittedly, the sparing use of Lambchop's formerly characteristic orchestral sound is often striking: the honking baritone sax sprinkled into portions of ""The New Cobweb Summer,"" the softly resonating vibes and quivering Moog of ""Caterpillar."" Also nice is the variously filtered angelic chorus answering Wagner's na-na's on ""I Can Hardly Spell My Name,"" and the sudden drop into lite-reggae halfway through the album-closing title track. But the listener has to work through a great deal of less stimulating material before reaching these worthwhile moments, with most of the eleven tracks running at least five minutes. Furthermore, the almost complete absence of significant drumming or percussion until the album's eighth track stretches the prolonged lull of ""My Blue Wave"" and ""The Old Matchbook Trick"" even longer. With little rhythm to anchor songs of such epic length, they much too easily float off into the atmosphere. Most tragic, though, is the startling uniformity of the album. Save the stop/start strut of ""D. Scott Parsley,"" Lambchop has stripped away much of the country and soul influence that made previous work so hard to categorize. What's left is a polished and subtle jazz-based sound that's hardly bad, but hardly good for more than intense bedroom headphone sessions or wine-and-cheese parties. A small ass-covering caveat: Is a Woman sounds threateningly like a ""grower"" album, the kind that suddenly clicks on the 108th listen as genius on the par of Pet Sounds, Loveless, or apparently, that new Trail of Dead album. If this is indeed the case, I'm sure I'll soon be run out of Criticsville by a torch-bearing mob, this embarrassingly short-sighted review preserved for all eternity in the Pitchfork archives. Until that day, however, I throw myself upon the mercy of the court.","Perhaps I'm missing something.

Scream the Sound,Emerald Down,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5e13d197565213b2dc/1:1/w_160/10230eda.jpg,2002-03-03 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2770-scream-the-sound/,Popsound,"Imagine if shoegazer became the standard in popular music like jazz did in the 1940s. Some equivalent of Ken Burns would at some point make a 10-hour epic chronicling the rise of Slowdive, Ride, Chapterhouse, and most notably My Bloody Valentine, and the shoegazing equivalent of Dave Brubeck would counter the attacks of purists with pronouncements like, ""Any idiot can swirl."" Somewhere in this imagined universe, the Emerald Down is firmly stuck in 1991 playing shoegazer standards every Thursday night at a Holiday Inn lounge outside Columbus, maybe staring catatonically at their enormous, pink shag carpet-covered amplifiers while a small crowd of grey-faced business travelers work just intently on their whiskey sours at the bar. It would take this kind of stylistic dominance, and the kind of sub-sub-genre stratification that would inevitably follow from critics, to tell apart and keep straight the hoards of faceless shoegazer bands that, to this day, keep cropping up inexplicably. I'm sure hardcore devotees of this style of music can recognize the subtle nuances separating all these bands that seem completely interchangeable to those of us who just dabble in what we consider the cream of the crop, but the debut from the Emerald Down, Scream the Sound, is so unabashedly retro that it just strikes me as sad. They've obviously invested a lot of time and energy into getting their imitation ""just right."" The question is, why? Why make an album that not only has already been made, and not only been made better, but has been made better about 300 times over at last count. I guess every genre has room for the B and C-league acts, and there are certainly people out there who would eat this up, but there's really no need for this unless you already own the entire output of the above mentioned bands plus about a dozen other groups. Still, there is something sickly endearing about a band so stuck in its own world that it refuses to acknowledge anything much has happened musically since the early 90s. All the classic shoegazer touchstones are present on Scream the Sound: dense, layered production aesthetic, loads of guitars, everything buried in a primordial soup of sound, and an average song length of six minutes plus. The boy/girl vocals offer a nice touch, though that too has been done about a million times by shoegazer bands, and, besides, everything is covered in such a sonic glaze that all vocals are pretty much indistinguishable from one another. Their idea of switching gears (like most bands of their ilk) is to flirt with shoegazer's daintier cousin, dream-pop. But this doesn't offer much in the way of variation, and even after three or four times through the album, nothing really stands out. If I had to pick one track, though, it would be ""Recondite Astral Traveler"" if only for the title alone, but it also has slightly more sinister, almost psychedelic feel to it. A close second would be ""Perilized,"" which strangely reminds me of Soft Cell's ""Sex Dwarf."" But in the end, the album simply stands as yet another testament to how influential My Bloody Valentine was/is. Too much so, it seems. So dominant and pervasive is their sound that it has stifled much, if any, stylistic growth within the shoegazer genre, at least on anything above a microcosmic level. Ten years after Loveless, bands the world over (this particular one is from Columbus via Portland) are still eager to faithfully reenact the intoxicatingly dense swirl and shimmering feedback of Kevin Sheilds & Co., showing little desire to push it forward. And the Emerald Down, like so many others, seem more than willing to be lost in sonic maelstrom.","Imagine if shoegazer became the standard in popular music like jazz did in the 1940s.

Getting into Sinking,AM/FM,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06dc0084474cd0bfb90/1:1/w_160/e54b198c.jpg,2002-02-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/145-getting-into-sinking/,Polyvinyl,"It's become increasingly apparent to me over the past couple of years that the Beach Boys are a significant influence upon approximately 58% of today's indie rock bands. Yeah, maybe this should've been obvious to me a lot earlier. But bear in mind that my formative Beach Boys experiences were a 1986 concert by the dreadful ""Kokomo""-era Mike Love incarnation I saw with my parents, and that ""Full House"" episode where John Stamos filled in on drums. Horrifying. Even in my recent enlightened state, I'm still surprised at the ubiquity of the Brian Wilson Sound, given that it only produced one album unanimously considered to be a masterpiece. Perhaps the Beach Boys continually open peoples' eyes to a variety of elements: the un-ironic falsetto vocal, the joy of nonsense-syllable lyrics (e.g. ba-ba-ba's and dooby-doo's), the tasteful blending-in of orchestral instruments, and the use of crystalline harmonies. Or maybe today's indie rock horde saw themselves as responsible for fulfilling the potential lost when Wilson surrendered to his insanity and his bed during the Smile sessions. Wait a minute, who is this review about again? Oh, right, AM/FM. To pigeon-hole AM/FM as yet another Beach Boys homage would be overly simplistic-- the band seems less directly inspired by Wilson & Co. than by bands who are themselves inspired by the Beach Boys-- not to mention Nick Drake and his legions of clinically depressed devotees, or more contemporary artists like the Coctails and Death Cab for Cutie. All of the above can be heard in the sonic casserole of Getting into Sinking, to various degrees. But still, it's the Beach Boys thing that I can't get out of my head, and I think it's caused by more than the duo's frolicking-through-sand-and-surf cover art. Brian Sokel and Michael Parsell have a knack for dreaming up melodies that sound familiar without sounding derivative, then tactfully using a wide arsenal of instruments to flesh out their vision. And it's all packaged up with the optimism and pep of a pre-manic depression, pinstripe suit-wearing Brian Wilson. Getting into Sinking bursts out of the gate with the anthemic ""Virgins! Virgins!"" and ""If We Burned All the Assholes the Earth Would Look Like the Sun,"" two songs with titles more appropriate for a Slipknot album, but harboring content that glitters with pop sensibility. The former combines lovestruck backing vocals, reverb-drenched guitar, and lazy drums into a package so smiley-faced I can (barely) forgive lyrics like, ""There are so many songs about rainbows/ But what's on the other side?"" ""If We Burned"" has a similar flair, carrying a hook like a pirate-ship captain, and working up a joyous cacophony by throwing in the some Elephant Six circus-style horns. The album never again reaches the heights of these opening tracks, but bounces enjoyably between sunshine daydreams and AM/FM getting their Garfunkel on: a fairly straight reading of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye"" and the coffee-shop folk of ""I Was Never Here Two Seconds Ago."" Missteps come from the exceptions to this formula, like ""It Fell Out of My Head,"" where the programmed percussion, repetitive guitar riff, and jarring chants sound like a less feminist and less catchy Le Tigre. ""Come Suck Down a Cloud"" attempts to build to a choir-fueled climax, but seems flat and forced compared to the album's simpler tunes. Getting into Sinking comes off like an album engineered for springtime, where the increasing temperatures and longer daytimes make even the hardest heart vulnerable to a innocently catchy song's viral attack. The dozen tracks within may not be the most memorable or groundbreaking ever recorded, but AM/FM's cheeriness is contagious enough to inspire nationwide Frisbee-throwing. Somewhere, Brian Wilson tips his fireman's hat.","It's become increasingly apparent to me over the past couple of years that the Beach Boys are a significant ...

I'd choose that and strip it down, give it more of an acoustic sound, piano, maybe a glockenspiel and pull out all of that crazy screaming at the climax.

Sai,Rovo,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b5b1335d7bf1698557/1:1/w_160/bf3ed8ab.jpg,2002-02-28 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6845-sai/,Warner Bros.,"They started out playing stuff that was fairly rough around the edges. It's not that the players were unfocused or naïve, but that they made a point not to do something which had already been done-- chiefly, to turn out ready-made product with the glossy veneer that had hooked the pro-pop junkies only ten years their senior. They played their boisterous clamor for a few years, and moved on. Next up was a more sophisticated brand of noise, though no less communicative for the change. First, they dropped the youthful bravado in favor of hip wisdom beyond their years. It's as if some weird muse had informed them that aiming for the intellect and modern mind could be cool, and unprecedented for bands like them. Their friends followed their lead, and before you knew it, the arena that had once introduced them was now subject to their whims, at the service of their transitions. Of course, this didn't last long, either. Pretty soon, they were into all manner of trial media-- be it musical, cultural, or chemical-- and all of it managed to alter the music they played. In fact, some would argue that these people met a crossroads during this time, as their public perception would forever be altered, due not only to their newly acquired avant-garde curiosity, but also to their completely comfortable way of passing through uncharted waters. The only way out of this labyrinth was to step out of the game entirely, which, following suit and their like-minded brethren, they did. The next phase was to attempt to recapture some of the green enthusiasm of their first days, albeit filtered through the inevitable change in their makeup from all the days of sophisticated, odd evolution. Their music from this time was arguably the best they ever made, in spite of the fact that the actual players were probably growing a bit tired of the journey with one another, and that it would seem humans can only take so much change in so little a time. But, for better or for worse, their friends went through the same things, and the trend was to always be at the forefront of the trip, so they persevered. In fact, the players were on the verge of implosion. They had reached a point where change no longer seemed relevant, and they decided to part ways rather than collectively grope for the next square. And that was it. This is the story of evolution and trends. Most people think of evolution (beyond the religious implication of the term) as an inevitable phenomenon, like ice melting and then turning to gas vapor. But when the concept of a trend comes up, particularly in art, it's viewed as a negative thing. ""They're just following the trend,"" or, ""This will never last, it's just a trend."" Well, sure, that's life, right? And then there's the above story. I read it, and thought ""The Beatles."" Of course, it also applies to Can, Led Zeppelin, the Who, even Abba. And if you take out the part about breaking up, it seems oddly close to the story of U2, R.E.M., Boredoms-- and let's stop here. All this allegory gets a little weighty after a bit. With Boredoms, you can actually see the evolution and trend from album to album. Most bands are like this. But within the scene from which Boredoms are extrapolated, you can see this stuff spread throughout. Rovo (unjustly pegged as a Boredoms side project, when in fact they are more the project of non-Bore violinist Katsui Yuji) have been around since 1998, and have generally played a kind of heavy-trance post-rock, like Tortoise with energy replacing atmosphere. Funny, though, if you took the exact same band members, and had them release a record in, say, 1991, it would almost certainly not sound like that. Back then, Yuji was just starting out with Bondage Fruit playing avant-prog; guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto was making serious racket with the early, noisy Boredoms; drummer Yoshigaki Yasuhiro was playing free-jazz and industrial noise with very early Ground Zero; bassist Jin Harada was playing avant punk-prog with Bazooka Joe. It was a noisy time. Five years ago, the same players would have been playing something a tad more sophisticated, though always keeping an eye to improvisation and experimentation. And today, they play beat-laden improv-trance. They aren't alone, because in Tokyo, Montreal and Chicago (and other places, too), this is the trend. And if you think of trends and evolution as symbiotic occurrences, then bands like Rovo not only make sense; they sound absolutely wonderful. Sai is Rovo's fourth release, though their only record to be released in America was 1999's Imago. For fans of the previous record, the sound remains essentially the same, with lengthy, repetitive jams featuring intricate percussion (courtesy of Yasuhiro and Okabe Yoichi's dual drum attack), profuse electronic manipulation (from Nakanishi Koji and co-producer Masuko Tatsuki), all colored by nylon and other strings (Yuji, Yamamoto and Harada). This record isn't quite as influenced by IDM as Imago was, and transfers much of the percussive drive to more straightforwardly rock rhythm tracks. The album begins with a track in Japanese, whose title I believe translates as ""Aurora Borealis."" It begins with light, water-bounce synth effects, and gradually introduces the cymbals and hi-hat (major players on this album), rolling and swishing away. This gives way to an actual beat, though it's closer to hard bop than gloomy post-rock. Throughout, Yuji's violin wails in the distance, like a disembodied vocal (or more likely, an Eno-esque ambient cry). But as underground Japanese musicians are wont to do, they play furiously where Western post-rockers would slide in unnoticed. This is where the trend gives way to inherent, indigenous qualities. There seems to be something restless in the air there, and despite all evidence of trance and hypnotic calm in the new style, they still play like free spirits. ""Vida"" is the next track, leading off with an expository hi-hat duet (one drummer on the left side, the other on the right). There's a sine-wave mediator to keep things colorful. This slight diversion lasts better than three minutes (all four of the tracks here are over ten minutes long) before the band kicks in with a relatively straight, if rapid Krautrock groove-- drummers fighting in synch all the while. Again, Yuji's violin colors the track, paired with various synth noises and textures, and Yamamoto's restrained strumming figures. ""Rano"" begins with a bouncy keyboard figure similar to the first track, though this time accompanied by what sounds like a constant stream of water, spraying at its fancy in the background. There are few radar blips before the rest of the players come in with Sai's calmest tune. An ostinato synth line, with equal parts wah-wah and analog pad resonance, fires away and the song crescendos to a double time trance-rock jam. The best part of this album is that you could listen to it while tripping, letting it serve as support system for various epiphanies, or you could peer in to the detail, and be treated to incredible musicianship and a more compact sound than seven people would be expected to make. The last tune is ""Seer,"" which again features the hi-hat duet, though here it's ridiculously precise where the earlier one was exploratory. Drummers should get a kick out of this album, if no one else, though this stuff should work as well for laypeople-- and don't worry, there is a little guitar to fluff it up a bit! Of course, Yamamoto seems to be playing with a velvet touch these days, a far cry from his Stooges-cum-Melvins skronk of the early part of the last decade. I won't fault him for calming down any more than I fault Tortoise for not playing grunge. First of all, it's not appropriate: this isn't 1991 anymore, and music, people and trends change. Secondly, it isn't fair: why would I expect any musicians to exist in the narrow reality for which I have created for them? Thirdly, it's simply not smart: Rovo plays Rovo's music, not Boredoms', not Tortoise's, and no one else's. Whatever the evolution of their scene, this is what they're doing now, and I think it sounds great.","They started out playing stuff that was fairly rough around the edges.

Source Tags and Codes,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a091c0084474cd0bfbe3/1:1/w_160/ae0be767.jpg,2002-02-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/178-source-tags-and-codes/,Interscope,"Some music begs to be explored. Promising fascination and intrigue beyond your wildest dreams, its distant melodies beckon you towards it while you try your very best to discern every distinct element that presents itself to you. As you get closer and closer, you begin to relax, letting yourself become completely enveloped by the entrancing tones. Of course, it's all a trap. Just as you begin to lose yourself, you become vaguely aware that the sound that soothingly beckoned you has now transformed into something vastly different-- something powerful, dangerous, and merciless. What was so beautiful at a safe distance is still beautiful, but what was once tranquil and peaceful has metamorphosed into a vicious, violent glory. Before you can even respond, you're flat on your back, pulverized by its sheer force. Making music that is both delicate and dangerous requires a level of skill that most musicians can barely even fathom. While some bands, like the Microphones, succeed at capturing the simultaneous beauty and rage of nature, what And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead have encapsulated on their third full-length, Source Tags and Codes, is something distinctly human. Anger has always played a central role in the band's music, but with this record, they've finally managed to capture all the subtle shades of disappointment, melancholy, frustration and hope that often accompany it. Of course, capturing all this with music is no small feat. Source Tags and Codes is massive in its execution, bursting with layered percussion, deftly arranged strings and, most importantly, songs that are simply epic. ""It Was There That I Saw You"" opens the album with squealing static and a clean guitar playing a simple, tickling figure. There's a palpable sense of excitement as the song suddenly explodes into a frenetic blast of crashing cymbals, screeching guitars, and thumping bass. Amidst the swell of sound, Conrad Keely's voice takes on a sharp, almost crystalline quality that cuts through the mix with biting force. ""Another Morning Stoner"" mimics ""It Was There That I Saw You"" in its opening moments, but rather than exploding with pure energy, it builds slowly and deliberately to an absolutely astonishing finale. Melodic guitar lines ricochet back and forth, brought to new sonic elevations by soaring string arrangements. The call-and-response section that finishes the song, in which two members of the band exchange the phrases, ""What is forgiveness?/ It's just a dream/ What is forgiveness?/ It's everything,"" is one of many absolutely indelible moments on Source Tags and Codes. ""Baudelaire"" follows the haunting ""Another Morning Stoner"" with a blast of pure rock and roll. Catchy and incredibly sinister, ""Baudelaire"" builds upon a central, immensely powerful guitar and trumpet riff with handclaps, driving percussion, and barely audible voices engaged in conversation. Eventually, the song trails off into a single submerged guitar line accentuated by reverb-soaked bells. Just as the hypnotic ending to ""Baudelaire"" pulls you into a trance, ""Homage"" picks you up by the hair, smacks you around, spits in your face, and leaves you gasping for breath, before imploding into a symphony of static. ""How Near How Far"" and ""Heart in the Hand of the Matter"" are the highlights of Source Tags and Codes' center, utterly alive with energy and texture. ""How Near How Far"" uses vocal harmonies and strings to reinforce a sense of violent melancholy, and the unforgettable chorus to ""Heart in the Hand of the Matter"" (""I'm so damned, I can't win"") is enlivened by the contrast between gritty guitars and clear, ringing piano. After another expertly produced segue, ""Monsoon"" pulls together the rock swagger of ""Baudelaire"" and the sentimentality of ""Heart in the Hand of the Matter"" to wonderful effect. The songwriting on Source Tags and Codes is inconceivably elegant-- never predictable, but never gratuitously dissonant. Parts of songs wind seamlessly into each other, each one full of brilliant sonic nuances that are every bit as compelling when taken as part of the entire song as when examined individually. Fragmented feedback heralds the arrival of ""Days of Being Wild,"" a song that hosts some of the most creative instrumental interplay to grace this album, before building to yet another utterly awe-inspiring finale. Source Tags and Codes is an album big on finales-- thus, it makes sense that its three final tracks are quite possibly its best. ""Relative Ways,"" which was released earlier this year as a single, is the most exquisitely constructed song here. Conrad Keely's voice breaks and spits as he pleads, ""It's okay/ I'm a saint/ I forgave/ Your mistakes."" An unexpected chord shift heightens the dramatic tension of the song just in time for it to return to its original theme and fade into ""After the Laughter,"" the only segue on Source Tags and Codes to be given its own track. A stunning concoction of dreamy vocal harmonies, radio noises, pianos and strings, ""After the Laughter"" is wonderful in its own right, but taking into account the fact that the song perfectly bridges the melodies of ""Relative Ways"" and the album's closer, ""Source Tags and Codes,"" it seems utterly brilliant. As with any epic album, Source Tags and Codes demands an epic closer, and the record's title track delivers masterfully. Both a lyrical and melodic high point, ""Source Tags and Codes"" captures the complex emotions of the album in a brief glimpse of pure paradoxical beauty. A perfect arrangement of the guitars, piano, strings, bells, and percussion that help make this record so intricate and powerful, the song sounds almost like a bittersweet reunion with old friends. A few seconds after last guitar has faded, a string ensemble plays a brief, gorgeous piece that is at once hopeful and somber. The strings end in unison on a single note, which is sustained for a few moments before fading out. The impact is immediate: you know without a moment's doubt that you have just heard something that is absolutely classic. And while Source Tags and Codes does seem to carry with it a certain knowledge of its own brilliance, it never tries to cheaply impress. Simply put, it doesn't need to. Dense, beautiful, intricate, haunting, explosive, and dangerous, this is everything rock music aspires to be: intense, incredible songs arranged perfectly and performed with skill and passion. Source Tags and Codes will take you in, rip you to shreds, piece you together, lick your wounds clean, and send you back into the world with a concurrent sense of loss and hope. And you will never, ever be the same.","Some music begs to be explored. Promising fascination and intrigue beyond your wildest dreams, its distant melodies beckon you towards ...

"A New Morning, Changing Weather",The (International) Noise Conspiracy,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97513d197565213ae69/1:1/w_160/b6bb2973.jpg,2002-02-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4110-a-new-morning-changing-weather/,EpitaphBurning Heart,"Used to be that a man was judged by the height of his church. The advent of the Gothic era found architects consciously testing the limitations of their craft as the European countryside became home to freemasons fueled by religious fervor, the first inklings of humanism, and the sole intent of creating the largest damn cathedral this side of Bayeux. Spires crept precariously higher and higher as the movement progressed, yet many designers continued to adorn their work with intricate stone-tracery in lieu of buttresses and other such means of foundation. The logical constraints of gravity that had long antagonized their art no longer seemed to concern many, as they immersed themselves in ""embellishment"" and paid little or no attention to the shortcomings of their tools. Naturally, many of their achievements were only temporary additions to the landscape; some crumbled before their completion while others managed to withstand only a few years. Had their designers not been so deterred by an exalted pissing contest, they may have actually built something with enough stamina and integrity to endure time's heavy toll. It just goes to show you that a little perspective goes a long way. Likewise, if a latter day gothic architect were to gaze upon the excessive sonic weight bore by any (International) Noise Conspiracy song, even he'd tell you that shit was ready to collapse. With Refused, the music of Dennis Lyxzén had a foundation strong enough to support the occasional interjections of electronica, jazz, and whatever other assorted weirdness he and his fellow Swedes conjured up in the studio. In fact, by the time the group had recorded their swan song, the excellent The Shape of Punk to Come, they had begun to invert the genre's oft-formulaic sound by cohesively weaving whole sections of evocative ambient noise into the mix. Now, having left the safe folds of Refused for the infinitely more didactic and uninspired (International) Noise Conspiracy, Lyxzén and partner Lars Strömberg turn to derivative song structures that try in vain to hold up the unwieldy mix of two effect-happy guitars, an incessant saxophone, clumsy keyboards, and Lyxzén's sub-par James Brown impression for over 45 minutes. Forgive me if I flee the scene for fear of imminent implosion. A New Morning, Changing Weather, the Conspiracy's sophomore effort, showcases the group's ability to liberally borrow from the Scorpions, Spinal Tap, and Nation of Ulysses without shame. ""Born into a Mess"" actually sounds like an über-rendition of ""Sex Farm"" (albeit, with an overtly Marxist slant). Much is made of the group's communist rhetoric, which is exemplified by an, admittedly, impressive reading list contained amidst the album's liner notes. But I've yet to understand how lyrics such as, ""I blow my mind everyday/ Turn on your love lights and let them shine on me,"" is supposed to incite a mass meditation on the flaws in modern economic procedure. Social commentary occasionally surfaces in the form of either puerile prose or oblique randomness, or sometimes, in an uninsightful succession of buzzwords. An example: ""Situations symptomatic/ Define the objectified and celebrate the phallic/ To deconstruct this before we run out of time."" Sounds like Foucault as interpreted by Trent Reznor. The most offensive thing about A New Morning is how generic it sounds. There's little-to-no variation in tempo, instrumentation, or aesthetic appeal, imbuing the album with all the emotional scope of Ben Stein. Lyxzén and Strömberg's exchange of guttural yelps and uh-huh's are sung in a perpetual state of over-emphasis, belying the triviality of their lyrical content. Even the various spots throughout the record in which the musicians are afforded the chance to experiment seem nothing more than afterthoughts conceived once the respective songs had already been arranged, and often come off as nothing more than ZOOM pedal wankery. Lyxzén's preoccupation with approximating the angst of teenage suburbia will sell a lot of albums amongst the burgeoning screamo crowd. Will he pull his album from the shelves when he hears that ""Capitalism Stole My Virginity"" is being played round the clock on M2, or at the local shopping mall? Probably not, but from what I can discern, the (International) Noise Conspiracy are at a far greater impasse. If their intention is to invoke the spirit of revolution in their fans, they need to offer a coherent and appealing alternative to the status quo and reflect it in their music. If their goal is to ascend to the upper echelons of hair-metal, they're only one virtuoso guitar solo away.","Used to be that a man was judged by the height of his church.

OSC-DIS (Oscillator in Distortion),Mad Capsule Markets,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35e5e6ef95969323808/1:1/w_160/01be993c.jpg,2002-02-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5025-osc-dis-oscillator-in-distortion/,Palm,"I've never been huge on heavy music. People's individual definitions of ""heavy music"" vary quite a bit, but when I say it, I mean music that aims to be heavy in the bone-crushing sense-- usually metal or hardcore. I never went through a Metallica and/or Megadeth phase in school, and I never got into Earth Crisis when I discovered punk. I like plenty of noisy stuff, but browsing through my collection, you're not likely to find much that the average listener would call ""brutal."" My friends are pretty well aware of this, and virtually every one of them has reacted with a certain amount of shock when they've heard Mad Capsule Markets blaring from my stereo. And it's true-- OSC-DIS may be the heaviest album I own, yet I've been playing the hell out of it. For some reason, it speaks to me in a way most music of its ilk doesn't. There are a lot of reasons for this, and the primary one is probably that, for all of their stuttering riffs, dropped tunings and double bass fills, Mad Capsule Markets are never lacking in the melodic department, which makes listening a lot easier. It could also have something to do with the cultural filter the music is being sifted through before it gets to me. See, these guys are from Japan, and they approach their music with a certain open-minded eclecticism that seems to characterize a lot of the music coming from that country these days. I think one of the reasons a lot of Americans find Japanese music so fascinating is that it's such an incredibly pure synthesis of influences. Punk, surf, industrial, prog, radio-ready pop, and just about any other genre you can think of are all treated equally, and don't carry the same baggage in Japan as they do in the U.S. Thus, Mad Capsule Markets' ninth album (their second available in the States) pours all of those genres and more into a 40-minute adrenaline blast that never gets tiring. Released in Japan in 1999, this album has already spawned five major hits for the band in their homeland, and it's easy to see why. Given a fair shake on radio in the U.S., I could see it enjoying a similar reign here, despite the fact that the band veers back and forth between English and Japanese lyrics (often in the same song). Vocalist Kyono ably alternates scattershot raps, deep growls and melodic singing, constantly switching approaches, while bassist/programmer Takeshi Ueda and drummer/programmer Motokatsu Miyagami lay down an intense rhythmic onslaught designed to alternately move your ass and pummel it into oblivion. The odd guitar works its way into the mix here and there, but for the most part, Ueda handles everything with his bass, dishing up clean, elastic lines and window-rattling, distorted figures with equal aplomb. OSC-DIS opens with the pulsating electronic rhythms and four-on-the-floor kick drum of ""Tribe"" before blasting into the first of many blistering choruses. Admittedly, the lyrics don't translate that well, but the increase in heart rate the song provides renders any concerns like that pretty well moot. ""Out/Definition"" follows, layering Miyagami's octopedal kit drumming on top of frenetic drum programs and weaving loops of Kyono's filtered screaming into the heavily distorted bassline to create a dense low-end texture that supports the semi-melodic rapping taking place in the foreground. ""N (Pulse)"" bursts with melodies indebted to West Coast surf and old school UK punk while the music churns violently underneath, injecting thunderous stuttering passages after each chorus. Occasionally, the keyboard programming comes close to the Mutant New Wave of the Tokyo-based band Polysics (such as on ""Multiplies""), though it's always featured lower in the mix. The brief ""Mob Track"" is one of the few tracks that subverts melody altogether, in favor of head spinning, industrial drum programming and meat-grinder bass not terribly far removed any of the hundreds of projects Alec Empire has put his name on. (That's a good thing here, by the way.) It's followed by the highly melodic, surf-drenched ""All the Time in Sunny Beach,"" which features lyrics about literally walking around on a sunny beach, a hilariously mundane topic when you consider the urgency with which it's sung. This gives way to ""Island,"" the real odd duck in this flock. The only song to feature guitar prominently, it sports verses that could easily be mistaken for the slow track on a mid-80s jangle pop album, complete with ""ooh ooh"" backing vocals (albeit with distorted lead vocals). These verses alternate with full-on hardcore punk choruses that feel strangely appropriate regardless of the abruptness they enter with. The rest of OSC-DIS swings wildly between the thrashing digital metal of ""Restart!"" and ""Jag,"" the buzzy jungle-punk of ""Step into Yourself,"" and the almost bouncy pop-punk of ""Good Girl (Dedicated to Bride After 20 Years),"" naturally cut though with ridiculously heavy passages that would make Blink 182 soil themselves. Then, it all ends with ""Midi Surf,"" an aptly titled number that ties together all of the album's musical threads, with heavy as hell verses, rapped pre-choruses, freakishly fast drumming and a heavily melodic chorus. Sequenced rhythms lurk in every corner of the mix, pushing the song even harder toward its abrupt conclusion, which ends the album in just about the exact right amount of time. So, overall, the Mad Capsule Markets have it going on in spades, grabbing your adrenal glands and squeezing them as hard as possible. God knows what their name means (I suspect it's an odd translation of some sort of drug reference), but I hope that doesn't keep people from noticing this band. Like I said before, I've never really been into heavy music, but this gets my full endorsement.","I've never been huge on heavy music.

Peak of Nothingness,KK Null,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43dea9e61561daa80df/1:1/w_160/171fa947.gif,2002-02-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5856-peak-of-nothingness/,Hushush,"There's something admirable about surviving. When you look at the kind of people who have made it through the last few decades of music in one piece, it's hard to argue that many survived. I'm not referring to the ones who came out clean, or who learned their painful lessons of youth and chaotic growth. Actually, when I think of musicians like that (Brian Wilson, the Beastie Boys and Iggy Pop, to name just a few), they don't seem like real survivors to me. They just seem like they got old. And that isn't romantic, exciting or even evitable. The survivors I love are the ones that made it this far in one piece-- the same piece they started with. How rare is it when an artist wields the same powers of persuasion and attraction twenty years down the road as they did when they made their big bang? There are always going to be diehards who support them through and through, and maybe there's something to be said of the personal connection an artist makes with his or her audience that could lead to such devotion. But, there is a school of thought that doesn't believe in that. Chiefly, the angels who are impervious to trend, age and metabolism are the ones that glow brightest for me. Now, this is idealistic, narrow minded and deeply unfair. It's a plan destined to fail; so says nature. But I picked it up somewhere, and it's hard to let go. I can defend some artists using this aesthetic, or I can just say that I like them because of whatever, and leave it at that. I can defend Tom Waits in this way. I can defend Boredoms in this way, and theoretically, I can defend John Zorn in this way (I'm not sure I really believe he's still truly surviving, though he has certainly made it further than most). I can also defend KK Null in this way, and though I never have, it's easy enough. Null started playing about twenty years ago, and began playing with his band Zeni Geva in 1987. They were a harsh, brutally intense band then. They still are, even though I don't always like everything they play. Null also releases solo albums, featuring his guitar, voice and other tools that are so often frustrating, disparate artistic statements that I really have to question why I'd ever consider him an admirable person. He isn't just making noise, but he isn't making friends, either. I can't get a handle on what he's doing all the time, even when I think it's beautiful (check A New Kind of Water, his collaboration with Jim O'Rourke if you suspect me, and why wouldn't you?). But he isn't less difficult now than he used to be. He hasn't lost the ability to change my mood. KK Null is as powerful an artist (not something inherently good or bad, but merely the basis of my dilemma, in this case) now as ever, and he shows little indication of burning out. Indeed, I admire KK Null for that. Peak of Nothingness is at once the embodiment of its title, and an act of false humility. Null has packed away his guitar for the vacuum comfort of a laptop. His press release says ""bleep core,"" which is as desperate a use to insert ""core"" into a genre as I've heard, especially considering that most of the time this album doesn't seem designed to purify or intensify (which is what I figure people mean when they append ""core"" to something) anything other than Null's interest in new composition. It isn't a record that I feel commanded to praise, though it's quite accomplished for someone who supposedly never made this kind of music before. But it is interesting, and it is something that strikes similar chords as when I first heard Zeni Geva. I want to hear more of him doing this, because I'm curious about where he'll turn, what mistakes he'll expose and what he might uncover along the way. Two of the pieces on Peak of Nothingness are quite grating, at least comparatively speaking. The first track (none of these songs have names-- Null uses running times in lieu of titles here) lasts barely over a minute, and features very distorted panned sounds and a slowly building shudder in the left speaker. It almost sounds like some kind of interstellar tennis match, with perhaps someone playing ""Atari Combat"" in the background. It leads without break to the second track, featuring a non-wavering metronome pulse with an ultra-high sine wave over the top. The last track is more like the sound of a digital construction site, with constantly running generator and oscillating power drills. It's a lengthy piece of music, most likely improvised (as was about half of the album, apparently), and I'm hesitant to describe it as ""industrial"" because of conditioned musical connotations, though of course it is. The remaining ten tracks are much softer, and often display subtlety for which Null is rarely credited. The third track brings back the sine wave and a few glitches every now and then, but these sound like real glitches-- i.e. mistakes, rather than strategically placed sputters and pops. Maybe this is the modern equivalent to ambient music. Or, maybe it's just a buzzing hum that means nothing. It's frustrating, and I like it. Track seven actually increases the volume (and static), and comes close to sounding like Fennesz, though Null has an even looser affiliation with melody than the Austrian. The fourth track is little but a soft electronic pulse, which summons passive techno demons by virtue of its consistency, but almost certainly accidentally. Track five keeps the consistent patterns, but translates them as hypnotic, dimensional sinoids, spinning across the speakers. There's a little radio static to give the piece color, but it's quite an impressive use of space with a ridiculously limited palette of sound. Again, this record may not be essential listening, but small pleasures abound. The only drawback with Null is that you never know if he'll ever return to this music again. There are so many ideas here, so many possibilities to explore, and yet I wouldn't be surprised if he was already beyond it. That said, laptops do seem to be the way of the world these days, and a vital artist rarely wastes an opportunity to make a statement on new toys.

The Stability EP,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d95e6ef959693212d2/1:1/w_160/32ca1fa3.gif,2002-02-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2228-the-stability-ep/,Barsuk,"""The gift of memory is an awful curse.""
--Ben Gibbard, ""Stability"" Aside from being a rather nice turn of phrase, this line from the title track of Death Cab for Cutie's new EP strikes me as oddly universal. That's not to say it applies to all people or memories, but it does bring up an interesting point, especially with regard to music. Given that music is a time-based art form, relying on the passage of minutes and seconds (or sometimes hours) to make its impact and relay its message, I sometimes get to thinking about what it would be like to listen to music if you had no memory. I'm pretty sure I first had this thought while exiting the theater after a showing of Memento. For those of you who haven't seen the film, it centers around a man who, after being attacked, loses the ability to form short-term memories. Without those memories, attachments become difficult to form, and his life begins to lose meaning altogether. It's actually quite a terrifying concept. Transposing this to music, think about how it would change the way you listened to things. First, you'd have no frame of reference for what you were listening to-- it would essentially be pure sound. Secondly, if your frame of memory were extremely short (say, five or so seconds) repetition would become basically meaningless. In the West, music relies so heavily on repetition to be successful that I think it would be interesting to see how the average pop song would fare without that benefit. I've often thought that I'd love to experience music from that standpoint for just one day, if only to gain a fresh perspective. Of course, this isn't what Gibbard is getting at. Rather, he's referring in somewhat abstract terms to those little nagging memories that we can't seem to make disappear, no matter how hard we try. This is often his topic of choice for lyrics, but don't think for a second that this is a typical Death Cab for Cutie release. With these two originals and one Björk cover, we find the Bellingham, Washington-based quartet exploring musical directions they've never fully headed in before, though listening back through their other records, you can find hints of this direction if you know what you're looking for. The EP opens with ""20th Century Towers,"" a wasted, incredibly slow song that hangs on the barest of rhythmic frameworks. ""I know the conscious choice was crystal clear/ To clear the slate of former years/ When I sang softly in your ear/ And tied these arms around you,"" sings Gibbard over Nick Harmer's swelling bassline, minimal guitar parts and somnambulant drums. The song's strange climax comes after Gibbard sings the line, ""Keeping busy is just wasting time/ And I've wasted what little he gave me,"" when the entire band joins to sing only two words-- ""All around""-- in harmony. The guitars become steadily more active after this point, with Gibbard and Chris Walla each playing a part on separate channels, making for an interesting stereo effect. Strangely, the band's cover of Björk's ""All Is Full of Love"" is both the most typical-sounding and the most propulsive of Stability's three tracks. Drummer Michael Schorr lays down a distinctive beat, mostly on his toms, immediately setting the version apart from the ambient, drumless original. Gibbard handles the vocal nicely, which isn't really too surprising, seeing as he and Björk sing in almost the same range. It certainly does not better the original, but I suspect it would at least work well in the car. Overall, it does what a good cover should do: it takes a fine original and adopts it to the band's own style, as opposed to copying it note-for-note. And then there's the 13-minute long title track. The first few minutes are affecting, plaintive and slow, very much in a similar vein with ""20th Century Towers."" The rhythm is far more insistent and steady, though, and things swell more quickly. Gibbard is joined by John Vanderslice, who sings backup on most of the song's vocal section. After the verses end, the song continues for nine minutes, with the apparition of Gibbard singing far in the background, and Walla's guitar playing a sparse part over molasses drums and bass. Vanderslice contributes some synth textures which help things bit, but in the end, this seems like one case where a lack of musical memory might be a good thing. That way, you at least couldn't tell how bloody long it is. The main problem is that the band doesn't really do anything interesting in that nine-minute span. There's no buildup of tension or subsequent release, and Vanderslice can only offer so much variation with his sustained synth chords and volume swells. If nothing else, I suppose it serves as a decent cure for insomnia. At any rate, it just sort of peters out at the end, keeping the EP from feeling like a fully realized statement. For those new to the Death Cab for Cutie camp, I'd say We Have the Facts and Are Voting Yes still stands as the best entry point, but the true fans might be into this new disc. It shows a side of the band that we only rarely get to see, and only briefly at that. Some fans may actually own it already, if they happened to purchase the limited edition first pressing of last year's The Photo Album or the Japanese import version of that album. For those who don't, Stability reveals a promising new dimension to Death Cab's sound that, in non-epic doses, could do wonders for their future releases.","""The gift of memory is an awful curse.""

Song of the Sovereign,Labtekwon,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc60ea9e61561daa746f/1:1/w_160/f7bb6268.jpg,2002-02-26 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4619-song-of-the-sovereign/,Mush,"Song of the Sovereign is a retrospective covering the first fifteen years of Labtekwon's career. ""Lab-tek-what?"" Yeah, he's definitely gone unnoticed in all but indie hip-hop circles, and he lets you know it more than once on these songs. But he's not just another MC whining about his holy struggle in the underground. His delivery's plainclothes at first, a sort of brown paper bag for all the identities kept inside-- amongst others, guru, prophet, griot, lover, philosopher and educator if you believe his boasts. His diversity means you can't pin him down too easily, though that may be one factor in his lack of fame. Of course, you might count ""the underground"" as just another crutch for those who lack skills, an excuse dressed up as treasure-filled crates. Search for a second and you'll find those telltale glints of gold: you can always identify the underground in its opposition to the mainstream. ""Culture"" weaves together positive and negative images of African-Americana, from b-ball and the mothers of mankind to prison and ""fornication on the frequent, regardless of consequence."" It's a solid cut, with an upbeat bass groove and piano-roll plinks, and Labtek flows playfully for the most part (""If you try to step you catch a Labteknical foul""). But there's a hint of elder-statesmen-of-rap-style preaching, talking about living like savages and asking ""fifteen years from now, we still going to be doing the same rhyme flows from '86?"" I don't know, Lab, you wrote this in '94-- when you gonna stop with the Native Tongues licks from the early 90s? That's the main problem across this retrospective; Labtekwon's beats are too simple. Most tracks are built from hip-hop's barest bones, just a looped beat and a sample. ""Speak on It"" is from 1996's Da Helpless Won, but the backing music sounds like a mixtape refugee from the early days of rap. There's this canned horn vamp that seriously hits on every single beat. It's unlistenable, too bad because lyrically Lab's on an African renaissance tip that would make Marcus Garvey proud. ""I almost cried when I realized black tribes sold out to the merchant ships/ Black girls becomes guinea pigs for Norplant/ I'm tired of all of this, I begin the war chant."" He spits, ""Ya god damn right I got a chip on my shoulder,"" but all I can think about is those horn bleats beating down on mine. Then there's seven uninspired minutes of ""Perversion,"" which drips syrupy-smooth inflections over a funk-a-delic bassline. No, baby, you ain't Dr. Funkenstein. Take off those star-shaped shades and come on down from the Mothership. So it comes down to the lyrics, and most of the time that's enough. The man is intelligent and articulate, and though he rarely raises above spoken-word volume, he cuts off on the rhythm, then fires back, bobs and weaves whenever necessary and doesn't shy from twisted perspectives. ""The Last Emcee,"" from the 2000 album of the same name, sketches out a picture in the third person, but you know who it refers to. The stage is set in Baltimore, Labtekwon's hometown. The plot: an MC's rise to fame. Despite its lyrical conceits the song succeeds, pivoting on spacy synthwork and the discovery that the underground's just as filled with snakes as the mainstream. 1997's Balti-Moorish Science offers up ""Perspective,"" whose turntablist scratches don't distract from the cutting quality of the imagery: ""Embryo grows, rise out of the water/ Fluid pours from the comatose form between the thighs of a daughter/ Birth canal hurts now/ No money for Lamaze classes."" There's a nice minimalism at work in the tracks at the middle of Song of the Sovereign. Most date to the last few years, and share a jazzy Native Tongues flavor even if the mood isn't always light. In an interview Labtekwon said that first and foremost he's always been a battle MC. I don't hear that, and not just because there's too few guests on this sampler. Labtek sounds most at home when he's on a mission, as on ""Darkside of the Sun"" from 1998's Nile Child. On top of crackling vinyl and Midnight Marauder keyboards he narrates about sun tribes and pharaoh phonetics: ""Proverbial Frankenstein's monster/ From ancient times comes the conqueror/ Odyssey'in to my epic."" On ""King of Kings,"" also from Nile Child, Labtek assumes an aggressive, raspy flow and the mantle of warrior king, dropping the gelatin/skin/skeleton rhyme before all his followers. In his spare time Labtekwon tutors kids, and his storytelling skills come clear as his best gift. His verses are studious, but most of the time not academic. Overall he's guilty of overconfidence, and singular vision is both his blessing and downfall. He's got charm, from his Sun Ra-style ""I-wasn't-born-here"" personal mythology to a Nation of Gods and Earths-influenced promotion of his community. But it's hard to deny that Lab's beats are boring. They're just too damn plain and retro. Listen to each track over and over and you might start to love them, but trying to get excited about them is like raising morale in the terminal ward. I'm guessing that maybe an actual album might be a better starter. Before Mush put together this retrospective, Labtek said a good introduction would be Da Dawn, Volume 5 in his extensive self-released Labteknology series. Anyways, check something because he's got his own unique science and it's worth it to watch it drop.","Song of the Sovereign is a retrospective covering the first fifteen years of Labtekwon's career.

The Day the Earth Met Rocket from the Tombs,Rocket from the Tombs,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2955e6ef9596932044b/1:1/w_160/845f7b5c.jpg,2002-02-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6814-the-day-the-earth-met-rocket-from-the-tombs/,Smog Veil,"Anyone up on their history of punk rock has heard of them, but relatively few have actually heard the music they made. And this is one of the main reasons Rocket from the Tombs is one of the most mythologized bands ever. Active for less than a year-- from winter 1974 to late summer '75-- RFTT released only one single during its brief lifespan, but its legacy was magnified by the two bands that sprung from its ashes: the scuzzy Dead Boys and arty, Beefheartian new wavers Pere Ubu. Ubu's Dave Thomas (who performed under the name Crocus Behemoth) started the band, later adding future Dead Boys Gene O'Connor (aka Cheetah Chrome) and John Madansky (aka Johnny Blitz). But the man most responsible for the band's mythic stature is Peter Laughner, a hard-living, Lou Reed-worshipping music journalist who wrote for the Lester Bangs-edited Creem magazine. He was also a promising songwriter (over the years his songs have been covered by Mission of Burma and Guns n' Roses, among many others) and a searing guitarist of Tom Verlaine-caliber. In fact, he was being groomed to replace Richard Lloyd in Television when he died of pancreatitis in 1977; years of constant drug abuse had simply worn out his body. And we all know what an untimely death means for an artist mythic stature, and as Laugher's rep grew so did that of RFTT. Of course, it didn't hurt that Pere Ubu released a series of excellent albums in the late seventies and early eighties. A lot of the discussion surrounding RFTT focuses on their milieu. I wasn't there, so I can't say I have firsthand knowledge, but my impressions, based on what I've read and heard, is that Cleveland in 1974 was an industrial wasteland and a cultural desert, all mangled metal and shattered glass sprawled upon the rusty shores of a lake that was so polluted it periodically caught fire. Just ask anyone who was there at the time-- they're almost proud of how shitty it was. And Rocket from the Tombs perfectly embodied the bleakness of the city. Perhaps no other rock band has embodied (and thus, made commented upon) its surroundings better. It's something more akin to early 90s gansta rap than anything seen in rock. Approaching the band from this viewpoint only deepens their myth. But what about the actual music? Does it measure up? Is RFTT actually worth listening to? Or are they just a band to be discussed, name dropped, and filed away? This 19-song comp, The Day the Earth Met the Rocket from the Tombs, seeks to answer those questions by offering ""a tantalizing glimpse at one of the greatest albums never recorded,"" as the back cover puts it. Nine of the songs are from home recorded demos, while the remaining ten are from two live dates; the sound quality, while nowhere near spectacular, is consistent and listenable. The easiest way to describe RFTT's proto-punk is as a combination of the Stooges and Alice Cooper, with hints of Sabbath, the Velvet Underground, the Troggs, and Beefheart. Altogether it's a jarring concoction. Lyrically, they were easily the most nihilistic American band since the Stooges. But RFTT's music is even more arresting than Iggy & Co.'s in the sense that one can imagine doing something else while listening to it-- say, exercising or driving. But with RFTT, all you feel like doing is huddling up in the corner, or turning it off. These are the only options this music offers. This comp fittingly begins with a partial cover of the Stooges' ""Raw Power"" and ends with ""Search and Destroy."" In between, the band covers ""Satisfaction"" (almost beyond recognition) and the unreleased-at-the-time Velvet Underground song ""Foggy Notion."" All of which have their charms, but far better are the RFTT originals, many of which later wound up on Pere Ubu or Dead Boys albums (or both). There are nascent versions of the classics ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" and ""Sonic Reducer"" bearing witness to a great idiosyncratic songwriter (Thomas) coming into his own. But the highlight of the album is Laughner's oft-covered ""Amphetamine"" (anyone familiar with Wilco's ""Misunderstood"" will immediately recognize the lyrics, which were respectfully lifted from this track nearly verbatim). This is the closest one can hope for in terms of a definitive recording of this mournful, yet unrelenting ballad. Yes, a ballad. These aren't all heavy punk songs. In fact, in this one song, you can almost hear the entire career of Paul Westerberg being born. But back to my earlier question: does the band's music live up to the lofty myth surrounding it? One might as well ask if unrealized potential can substitute for actually delivering the goods. The answer, friends, is no. Had personality conflicts not ripped the band apart before it could capitalize on its members' talents, Rocket from the Tombs might have recorded a groundbreaking album. But they didn't. And so, all that's left are these fragments, left over from a by-gone era, and they can either be mourned over for what they're not, or enjoyed for what they are. I'll choose the latter.","Anyone up on their history of punk rock has heard of them, but relatively few have actually heard the music ...

The Trial of St-Orange,Shalabi Effect,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b513d1975652138b4b/1:1/w_160/a282d2b5.gif,2002-02-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7089-the-trial-of-st-orange/,Alien8,"If you place any faith in the Fork at all, if you give any credence to our pretentious ramblings, if you've ever picked up a record because we told you to; then please, dear readers, do yourself a favor. Stop reading this review now and tear yourself away from that Spoon album. Then, buy/burn/download/steal/or otherwise get hold of a copy of the Shalabi Effect's The Trial of St-Orange. Go listen and then come back. Because if you don't, if you read this review before you hear the album, it'll spoil all the surprises. Yes, that's right, oh wearied music listener: surprises! The unexpected! When was the last time you heard an album that genuinely surprised you again and again? When was the last time you threw an album on in the background, only to find yourself torn from wherever your attention was supposed to be focused because the music was doing things you absolutely did not expect it to? Because this is what happened to my jaded ass, and I haven't been happier in ages. Not only does the Shalabi Effect surprise upon its virgin spin, it continues to reveal new elements with each consecutive listen. But still, that initial St. Orange session is a wonderful experience. And I'd rather not rob anyone of it. But alas, a job is a job, so for better or worse, here goes: A primal feel is established from the disc's opening moments. An acoustic guitar is plucked as faint percussion falls like raindrops over ubiquitous natural field recordings-- bird songs, forest sounds, etc.-- placed at far intervals. Periodic gong soundings emerge. At first, the metal is allowed to resonate in a mostly empty space, but soon the field recordings grow far less distant. As we move into the second track, ""Sister Sleep"" (there are only three movements here, but there are seven individual tracks), the field recordings grow less sparse, and much louder. These sounds dominate the mix, effects are added, and the results are placed into loops. Soon, the random percussion falls into line like soldiers at attention. Rapid-fire hand-percussion serves as a counterpoint for the electronic sounds and fragmented guitar that creep slowly from the soundworld like the legs on one of those bugs that show up on humid days in basements and garden apartments. Thus begins a slow transformation from sparse, yet identifiable sounds into all-encompassing ethereal noise. It's easy to miss the certain subtleties in this disc the first time through-- you don't realize what you've heard until it mutates into something different. This is best exemplified on the next track, ""Mr. Titz (The Revelator)""-- and if you were wondering why this album isn't rated a solid 10.0, look no further than that title-- when the heavenly noise falls out entirely, leaving behind nothing but a quick, repeating bassline. There's a very brief vocal sample, kicking off a race between Will Eizlini's North Indian hand percussion and Sam Shalabi's frantically repeated guitar part. All the while, electronics float about, growing more comfortable with the idea of structure every minute. But the listener doesn't realize the development of the electronics part until the song transforms altogether into a straightforward drum machine roll, taking the movement in a whole new direction. I could gladly go on. I could write thousands of words, in hope that my meager keyboard could replicate the intricacies of The Trial of St-Orange, the way gently chimed bells dance with electric static as faint memories of guitar melodies past linger over a background of found sound in ""A Glow in the Dark."" Or the way that very guitar part will keep repeating, adding a new nuance each go round until what was once a background element has taken the lead. To describe every subtle nuance on this album, every last unpredictable twist and turn of this music would be as impossible as it would be futile. This is the sort of music that defies description. Because even if you were to say that the Shalabi Effect fuses elements of Canada's burgeoning experimental electronics/musique concrète with psychedelic rock structure and North Indian harmonics, you'd still be failing to account for the ambient drones that layer so many moments or the tendency to place sparse AMM-style tinkering in the dark spots between would-be crescendos. And I did say ""would-be."" Much like that of fellow Montreal scenesters Godspeed You Black Emperor!, the Shalabi Effect's music is always building towards something. GYBE! takes the obvious way out, usually culminating in a grand cinematic blast. Like a Hollywood action movie, you enjoy it despite its predictability. The Shalabi Effect, though, is the Amelie to Godspeed's Lord of the Rings, veering off on an unexpected path each time it reaches the finale. Which is why I'm hoping you heeded my advice, why I'm hoping that if you've made it this far into the review, you've already heard The Trial of St-Orange. Because, much like an intercontinental cruise or (more likely, given the Pitchfork demographic) a good road trip with a few close friends in a rusty old Chrysler, the payoff here comes not in the arrival, but in the trip itself. A review of an action movie won't ruin anything, because anyone who's seen a couple of them is likely to predict the entire plot before the popcorn's gone. But the Shalabi Effect isn't just another rehashing of pop-culture cliches. They're as unpredictable and original as can be. And in today's lukewarm, microwavable, prepackaged culture, that's the biggest surprise of them all.","If you place any faith in the Fork at all, if you give any credence to our\n\ pretentious ramblings ...

To Everybody,90 Day Men,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c407ea9e61561daa8065/1:1/w_160/a7d8f604.jpg,2002-02-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5806-to-everybody/,Southern,"Help me out here, people. It's time we all put our minds together and came up with a new name for the genre known as ""post-rock."" Now, genre labels are never very descriptive, and usually serve merely as a crutch for writers and a denial target for musicians (""We're not emo!"" a thousand bespectacled bands cry). But they do serve some purpose as a sort of critical shorthand-- I tell you a band is new-wave synth-pop, and your brain instantly dials up an approximate framework for the music at hand. Post-rock is an especially faulty term, however, since it says almost nothing about a band's sound, other than it being somehow ""after rock."" It's sort of like describing an especially tasty dinner as being post-lunch. What else can we call it then? One could go back to the genre's obvious roots in King Crimson-style complexity and call it neo-prog, or something more futuristic, like prog-o-tron. If it's important to tip a hat to the music's German origins, Ameri-Kraut might catch on. Or we could all just tell it like it is and label it pretentious-core. I'm open to suggestions. All this semantics-wrassling is provoked by 90 Day Men, an act that many would most likely lump into post-rock or math-rock circles. On To Everybody, their second album, the St. Louis quartet may possibly be addressing this problem of classification by naming a track, ""We Blame Chicago,"" indicting the geographic center of post-rock with charges of beating the genre into clichédom. That's just a wild guess, and only the 90 Day Men know the real story behind the title, but To Everybody comes across as just such a challenge to the scene. The first three minutes of the opening track, ""I've Got Designs on You,"" led me to think that the album had little in store, with Dianogah's melodic bass, Don Caballero's gymnastic drumming and an irritating pinched whine for vocals. However, after eight minutes of bobsled run twists and turns (sorry, too much Olympics), I was hooked. What happened? Well, the addition of Brian Case's textured guitars and more restrained counterpoint vocals didn't hurt. But the real kicker is Andy Lansangan's piano, which slowly enters the fray before taking control and allowing the composition to achieve liftoff. Piano, you say? Big frickin' deal, you say. I'm gonna go see what else Pitchfork reviewed today, you say. Shut up and sit down, I say. While the piano might not be the most advanced of instruments, Lansangan uses it to great effect on To Everybody, adding much-needed warmth and melody to 90 Day Men's sound. Where the band's previous effort, 1999's (It (Is) It) Critical Band, occasionally sank into the sludge of an overly busy rhythm section, Lansangan's inventive playing has the band in a much more balanced state instrumentally. No one song showcases their new strengths like the aforementioned ""We Blame Chicago,"" a piano and wah-wah-driven piece that swoops and darts through two tuneful movements, disintegrates into noise, then returns triumphantly to the original theme. 90 Day Men function like a musical assembly line, with each member playing simple phrases that add up to a cohesive and complex whole. While many bands that take this approach sound overly choreographed and rigid, Lansangan's jazzy style keeps things loose, giving off at least the appearance of improvisational energy. ""St. Theresa in Ecstasy"" and ""A National Car Crash"" follow a stretched out version of the same blueprint, slowly assembling an intricate pyramid of sound before destroying it all like an angry toddler, only to rebuild it even higher. While the former says less than it probably should over its near nine-minute length, the latter closes the album with a fiery display of tension-release dynamics. If 90 Day Men have a weakpoint, it's in their vocals, which are predominantly used as just another color of yarn to knit into their musical scarf. That most singing gets buried in the mix is perhaps a wise decision, as only the brief, aerobic ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"" reaches minimum singalong-ability. When the vocals are too prominently displayed they distract from the music beneath, or at worst, are wincingly melodramatic (""Alligator,"" where the band's prog side gets the best of them). 90 Day Men are also smart enough to know that listeners can only handle so much of their dense, sinister sound in one sitting, and keep the album at a lean, mean forty-minute length. And despite a few missteps, To Everybody indicates that the 90 Day Men are a band to watch in the Ameri-Kraut arena, using familiar ingredients but to greater effect. It may even end up being one of the better prog-o-tron releases of 2002. What do you think, are they catching on?","Help me out here, people.

"Gunpowder, Treason and Plot",Red Monkey,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2309d034d5c69bf2b37/1:1/w_160/4c2a2b6d.gif,2002-02-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6718-gunpowder-treason-and-plot/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Why do you know the name Red Monkey? Well, you may have seen them open for Fugazi a while back. Or you may recognize Pete and Rachel as members of Pussycat Trash and mainstays of Slampt Underground. But more likely, you caught a glimpse of an album cover while fueling your secret shame by scrolling through Troubleman's new releases on their nifty webbar catalog. Hell, they may even be old hat to you now, after six odd years and three albums to their name. Alright, I was fucking with you. You don't know the name. And, after careful deliberation, it is my considered opinion that you should not ever want to. I suppose since the title is a line from a familiar-to-Brits nursery rhyme about proto-terrorist Guy Fawkes that gets chanted every November 5th, we're supposed to start with assumptions of a politicized worldview. But as it turns out, this record is more about alienation-as-politick. (Seriously, if the terrorists aren't alienated, who is?) Here, on Gunpowder, Treason and Plot, the requisite and anticipated socio-political observances would have had a somewhat mullable quality to them if they weren't flavored with such self-mutilation-inducing, quasi-poetic lyrics. The lazy half-speaking here is of an especially grating sort. I admit I have a pretty low threshold for shit like that, and tend to give special dispensation to famous ""spinkers"" (e.g. Lou Reed, Travis Morrison and Mark E. Smith) to get at the quality music behind the tone-deaf frontmen. Red Monkey isn't quite in that class. Pete and Rachel take turns sputtering or droning into the mike. The apathy they display in their voices transliterates 100%: I soon no longer care one whit about what they're singing, and only digest the lyrics through the chore of reading them apart from the listening experience. Jerky rhythms that do nothing more than prove these simians can count to five instead of four are used, overused and abused on each and every song. Hey, free advice: if you're interested in subverting the traditional rock reliance on 4/4, try not immediately setting up another crutch in its place. It didn't work for the El Salvadoran government and it's not going to work for post-hardcore, either. We liked Gang of Four, too, guys. Please respect their memory. When the music and unmelodies almost work, the lyrics don't (""Sewing,"" ""From Ground Down""), and vice versa (""Jazz Step Forwards""). The result is an album out of sync with itself. Perhaps Red Monkey got too distracted worrying about trying to nail their time shifts to miss the fact that the separate components of the album were evolving away from each other. Or maybe they just haven't figured out yet that while art can be a vehicle for political expression, a guitar isn't a megaphone and an amp isn't a soapbox. Either way, it results in a incredibly trying, forced and uncohesive ten songs. Hearing to this album, I get the sense that Red Monkey is a much better band to experience live. As bad as this material is, they do have a good sense of dynamics going for them, and a presence more apropos to the stage than to plastic. For example, the single noteworthy track, ""Courage in This Now,"" is an epic blast and has a bring-down-the-house potential that could very likely be positively incendiary in a sweaty, shoulder-to-shoulder environment. But after reflecting on Gunpowder, Treason and Plot via the headphone experience, deprived of the boosting charisma inherent in a live setting, I realized what it is that I now find intolerable about bands like Red Monkey. For all their efforts to be different, they're all playing the same notes and riffs over the same stock ""edgy"" beats, and singing along to it with the same adolescent gripes. Same as their own other songs; and the same as other bands. So what makes this approach inferior to, say, an equally blunt-to-a-fault throwback punk band like Anti-Flag?

"Open, Coma",Tim BerneHerb RobertsonCopenhagen Art EnsembleMarc Ducret,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27f9d034d5c69bf2bf1/1:1/w_160/8ea36ebc.gif,2002-02-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/663-open-coma/,Screwgun,"Back in the 80s, when John Zorn was namechecking hardcore bands and Tim Berne was making albums like Fulton Street Maul, you could assume that the downtown jazz scene had a lot of anger. Berne collaborated on Zorn's Spy vs. Spy, one of the most violent records of 80s jazz: two alto sax players destroying the compositions of Ornette Coleman by flaying them with skronky solos and pummeling drums. They were kicking off a punk/jazz revolution. Or so it seemed. In retrospect, no matter how loud or chaotic the John Zorn/Knitting Factory axis of musicians would get, the music was too brainy or too careful to be cathartic. Rather than combining hardcore with jazz, composers like Zorn ultimately handled it as just another style to mimic, alongside surf music or the works of Messiaen. In the case of Tim Berne, the cocky swagger of his horn and the snarly twists of his compositions arrived diluted. Even when Berne told his band to shred, there was still some chin-scratching and careful treading-- not to mention that his collaborators might throw in everything but the kitchen sink by way of electronics and gadgets. He made some good music, but song titles like ""Unknown Disaster"" promised something stronger. And then came Bloodcount. In the early 90s, when Berne assembled this acoustic quartet, he finally had a band where he could create decisive and undistracted music played by in-your-face virtuosos. Berne's smooth alto and rumbling baritone sax knocked against Chris Speed's keening, wailing tenor and clarinet; bassist Michael Formanek anchored the band, and now-legendary drummer Jim Black kicked up a ruckus like a 300-pound construction worker. Unwound still stands as Berne's masterpiece, with three discs of clear but raw recordings that conveyed every pound of metal and wood, and every drop of sweat. Here, finally, was a guy who deserved the right to print ""FUCK THE KITTY"" on an album cover. After starting his own label, Screwgun Records, Berne released several albums by Bloodcount and by his trio Paraphrase, an unusually taut and rhythmic free improv combo. His latest album, Open, Coma, presents his first recordings for big band: a two-disc set recorded with the Copenhagen Art Ensemble, plus his long-time associates Marc Ducret and Herb Robertson as featured soloists. And it's no surprise that for all the colors and nuances of Berne's and conductor Ture Larsen's arrangements, this band is primarily an instrument of force. The great Basie and Ellington orchestras could get just as raucous, but they also had elements of swing and ""cool"" that Berne has mostly dispensed with. At turns rowdy, gorgeous, and frantically overstimulating, it's an exciting performance of Berne's catchy and intricate writing. The four compositions on Open, Coma run between thirty and forty minutes each. That's not an unusual length for Berne, but it's still surprising how tight each piece sounds: there's no noodling or open spaces. Each track is carefully organized into solo, small combo and group passages. Berne can throw more catchy melodies into a single piece than many people write in their lives, and he uses as many as seven in the longest track, ""Eye Contact."" This piece actually sounded mild and a little thin when Bloodcount (plus guest Ducret) first recorded it in 1994, but here, with a larger band, Berne is able to flesh out its beauty and aggressiveness, while still setting up some great solo features. If the players seem slightly uncomfortable speeding through the knottier group passages, they make up for it by slamming through ""The Legend of P-1"" at full speed: the piece builds to rock music intensity, and then segues to a rowdy burlesque-- just add dancers. ""Impacted Wisdom"" is a little looser, with sections like a calm middle part that emphasizes flute and muted trumpet. The title track, which is the newest piece and the only one that debuts here, has gentler transitions, and fewer contrasts and changes: the horns swell in waves across the themes. The Copenhagen players are completely committed to Berne's concept, from the more lyrical solos of Lotte Anker on soprano sax or Peter Fuglsang on clarinet (the latter unwinding his instrument over drifting backgrounds), to the rowdier sections like the open horn improv near the end of ""P-1."" Thomas Clausen's piano accompaniment dances around the melodies, and his distorted Fender Rhodes adds a perfect rough texture-- for example, behind Ducret's solo on ""Open, Coma."" Of the featured soloists, Ducret is a fascinating guitarist who has a rubbery tone-- he's derivative of Bill Frisell, by way of Gumby, but he's more willing to shred and make some nasty sounds. Herb Robertson is a phenomenal, extremely expressive trumpet player: his plunger work here is incredibly entertaining, as expected from someone who's known to take his trumpet apart in mid-solo to get the sounds he wants. And as for Berne, his solos are inventive and tangled, wrapping around ideas like a rat snake. When he needles into the upper register it may make your ears hurt, but let him go: he's earned it.",,8.9,
Versus,Kings of Convenience,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbab13d197565213b144/1:1/w_160/49f17715.jpg,2002-02-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4447-versus/,Astralwerks,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a historical journalistic event. In an effort to properly discuss Versus, the remix album from Scandinavian folk duo Kings of Convenience, I hereby create one of the first-ever remixed album reviews. To make this experiment a reality, I considered copying all of Pitchfork's review of Quiet is the New Loud (KoC's previous album, from which most of Versus' material derives) and adding a drumbeat. But not knowing its writer, Richard M. Juzwiak, I've opted for a different, even more revolutionary approach. With the assistance of Sven Bjørlykke, Norway's ninth-highest selling electronic artist, I present to you a live remix of my Versus review. Say hi, Sven. ""Hyggelig å treffe deg!"" Okay, let's get started. [funky drum beat] The remix album has long fought with the live album for the title of most self-indulgent career move; the equivalent of a TV sitcom's ""clip show"" episodes. [oonce-oonce bass] Usually consisting of clubbed-up traxx made suitable for step aerobics and fashion show runways, it's rare to find a remix album that holds allure for anybody but an artist's most diehard fans. A Kings of Convenience remix album, however, would seem to generate a certain amount of curiosity amongst any music fan, as the duo's usual folky, soothing aesthetic makes Simon and Garfunkel sound like Megadeth. [space-synth EQ] But on Versus, Eirik Glambek Bøe and Erlend Øye enlist a number of umlauted and ø-bearing laptop wizards to sculpt their songs into something more akin to the kind of stuff Astralwerks usually releases. Given the band's highly minimalist style, the tweakers are forced to use the subtlety and restraint usually missing from remixes, tastefully embellishing the songs without being overly distracting. It's unsurprising, then, that the most effective interpretations are offered by the most organically inclined remixers. Four Tet funks up ""The Weight of My Words"" with per-, per-, per-, cuss-, cuss-, per-, per-, per-, FourFourFourFour, Tet, Tet, per-, per-. Hey, Sven, I thought we agreed on no glitch? ""Angre pa."" That's okay, it's just sort of hard on the reader. [wood block clicks/clacks] As I was saying, Four Tet take on the seemingly impossible task of funking up the formerly wussy ""The Weight of My Words"" using live percussion breaks and turning up the bass knob. [backwards guitar feedback] It doesn't sound like much, but the increased presence of a rhythm section here-- as well as on reworkings by Rokysopp and Bamboo Soul-- transform the sparse original versions into more realized compositions. Adding a low end doesn't change much about Kings of Convenience's reading glasses and turtleneck sound-- they still generally sound like two guys who deserve to be beaten for their lunch money. [rimshot] Thanks, Sven. Riton's addition of Latin rhythms and trumpets refashions ""The Girl from Back Then"" into the kind of soft-rock most commonly found on beauty salon PA systems. [bongos and maracas] Later, the duo's collaboration with Erot on ""Gold for the Price of Silver"" (the album's one previously unreleased track) indicates that pale Norwegians haven't quite yet mastered the swagger of 60s booty soul. Though cheesy, these two tracks at least play to the easy listening strengths of the Kings' material, and have an enjoyable Sunday afternoon feel. [hand claps] Only Evil Tordivel (if that is his real name) takes the Bacharachiana too far with a keyboard bossa nova preset, ultra-fake horns, and what sounds like a steel drum on his ""remake"" of ""Leaning Against the Wall."" [skating-rink organ fill] Attempts to give the band a Rawk infusion, however, are similarly unsuccessful. [clanking machine rhythm] Ladytron's fuzzy synths and relentless drum loops overwhelm the breathy vocals, and, like much of their own material, grows tiresome long before the end of the track. [smooth sax solo] Right, Sven, that reminds me about the Kings' own ""arrangement"" of ""Failure,"" which differs from the album version only in its use of sleazeball lounge horns. And while the brass adds an inoffensive, jazzy swing to the song, it's a nearly inconsequential change that only Kings of Convenience completists would find it necessary to hear/own. [wikkity wikkity turntable scratch] Same goes for the ""string arrangement"" of ""Toxic Girl,"" adding (duh) strings to the original track, and the instrumental reprise of Four Tet's ""The Weight of My Words"" remix. Given all this filler, Versus bears the usual problem of a remix album: the contents would perhaps have been better released on singles, or the best stuff put together as an EP. [electric piano drone] But that best stuff (Four Tet, Erot, Andy Votel's ""Winning a Battle, Losing the War"") gives Versus a leg up, presenting a Kings of Convenience I would actually choose over the un-remixed version of the band. Then again, the world already has one Pinback, which is what most these interpretations end up sounding like. [brass fanfare] This concludes our experiment with remixed music criticism, sure to be the next critical trend to sweep the nation's webzines. Thanks again to Sven Bjørlykke for helping out. Say goodbye, Sven. ""Pa gjensyn!""","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a historical journalistic event. In an effort\n\ to properly discuss Versus, the remix album ...

Walking with Thee,Clinic,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fe9d034d5c69bf3420/1:1/w_160/6989fca4.jpg,2002-02-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1512-walking-with-thee/,Domino,"Somewhere in the town where you live is a middle-aged man who's been in a band since his late teens. His belly wobbles around under his too-tight, stained white tank top and his oil-slicked hair is tied up in a ponytail. To pay the bills, he does sound at the local bar. He hangs out at the local record store, selling off his old vinyl with disclaimers like ""we almost opened for them once,"" and ""yeah, I heard that his sister was really into the band."" He doesn't have a family, aside from the four other middle-aged men he hangs out with on weekends and the drummer's 13-year-old nephew, who they recruited when their old rhythm guitarist moved to Arizona. This man likes beer. He likes Led Zeppelin. And although he's never heard of Clinic, he fucking hates them. The world is full of aging, frustrated career musicians who've struggled their whole lives to write a single song that doesn't sound like AC/DC's ""Big Balls."" And yet, only one proper album into their careers, Clinic managed to accomplish several of the most coveted goals of rock musicians: they amassed a small but fiercely dedicated following, received almost unanimous critical praise from the likes of John Peel, and they toured with one of the most successful bands in the world. Perhaps most importantly (and most impressively), they had utterly mastered their art. Internal Wrangler sounded as good as an album like Internal Wrangler could possibly sound-- and Internal Wrangler was the only album that sounded like Internal Wrangler. Having conquered their own unique brand of dirty, beautifully awkward garage rock, Clinic was left to seek out new castles to storm. With Walking with Thee, they venture towards a darker, more mythical castle, but seem stuck halfway between their past victories and their new aspirations. Lyrically and musically, this album is darker and more austere than its predecessor. While Internal Wrangler seemed to radiate an immediate nervous energy, Walking with Thee is much more detached. ""Harmony"" opens the record promisingly, with a spooky electric piano and hypnotic bassline providing a backdrop for Ade Blackburn's nasal, reptilian vocals. Here, the combination of Blackburn's more withdrawn (and more decipherable) vocal delivery and the similarly lucid production works wonderfully. The song's ethereal refrain of ""fill yourself with dreams"" is absolutely haunting, and one of the greatest moments Clinic has laid to tape. ""The Equaliser,"" one of four songs from this album performed in August of 2000 on John Peel's radio show (and later retitled), begins to incorporate the more dynamic, pulsating energy of Internal Wrangler with a new, darker side of Clinic, but never follows through. The moment when all the instruments cut out and Blackburn intones, ""We hoped for the best and the best then we left so,"" is absolutely fantastic. But the rest of the song never goes much of anywhere. ""Welcome,"" once known as ""The Jouster,"" sounds like it could have been taken directly off of Internal Wrangler, but the absence of the rough energy that helped make that album so incredible leaves ""Welcome"" feeling a bit limp by comparison. The album's title track also bears a very strong resemblance to the band's earlier work-- but the song itself is so good that it would be hard to levy any kind of serious complaint against it. With a driving beat, trademark fuzzy organ and bass arrangement, and some of the most urgently mumbly vocals to be found on the album, ""Walking with Thee"" is a short, sweet reminder of what made Clinic so great in the first place. Sadly, the same can't be said for ""Pet Eunoch"" and ""Mr. Moonlight,"" which sound almost like carbon copies of Internal Wrangler's ""Hippy Death Suite"" and ""Earth Angel,"" respectively. Again utilizing a repeating electric piano figure, ""Come Into Our Room"" sounds a bit like a more subdued version of ""Harmony."" The same electric piano is coupled with the exact bassline from ""Voodoo Wop,"" to limited effect. ""Sunlight Bathes Our Home"" opens with a slight variation on the opening of Internal Wrangler's title track, played by a clarinet. Internal Wrangler was an album rich with contrast-- wherever there was a steady, fuzzed-out organ, there was a shifty bassline or syncopated drumbeat to underscore it. This masterful arrangement left the album with a slightly unsettling sense of perpetual motion that seems underplayed a bit on this record. Finally, with its closing track, Walking with Thee picks up where ""Harmony"" left off. On ""For the Wars,"" Clinic recaptures the cold, haunting aesthetic that makes the album's opening track so engaging-- this time as a ballad, instead of as a jittery rock number. Dreamy guitars, reverb-soaked background vocals, and some of Ade Blackburn's most affecting lyrics to date make ""For the Wars"" a perfect realization of the newer, more crystalline elements of Clinic's sound. It's pretty much a given that most bands work largely from formula. If the band is good, odds are they're working from a self-composed formula, rather than taking cues entirely from their influences. If they're really good, they can mix things up enough to keep their formula from becoming transparent. On Internal Wrangler, and the better parts of Walking with Thee, Clinic managed to be distinctive without ever sounding formulaic. In parts of this album's squishy middle, though, Clinic seems far too comfortable relying upon the melodies of songs they've already written. Ultimately, Walking with Thee is neither an album of triumph nor of disappointment. Its first and last tracks hint at a new direction for Clinic that could, if fully realized, become something utterly brilliant. Yet, much of this record remains stuck between the raw vitality of Internal Wrangler and the detached, haunting beauty that's hinted at on ""For the Wars"" and ""Harmony."" Thankfully, the album is less of a tragic misstep than an awkward straddle. And at this point, there's very little doubt that Clinic are perfectly capable of turning awkwardness into brilliance.","Somewhere in the town where you live is a middle-aged man who's been in a band since his late ...

AOI:Bionix,De La Soul,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c4ea9e61561daa58d2/1:1/w_160/eda4d8de.jpg,2002-02-24 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2207-aoibionix/,Tommy Boy,"The aging of hip-hop presents a serious structural dilemma, similar to the one rock and roll faced a few decades after its inception: if a genre's narrowly targeted at the kids, what happens when those kids grow up? Most of rock's pioneers hit middle age in the 1980s. Their responses to this dilemma sucked more than a modicum of ass, with none sucking more of it than Bowie and Jagger's near career-killing rendition of ""Dancing in the Streets."" So far, golden-era hip-hop hasn't fared much better. Among the many who've fallen include Q-Tip, whose formerly enlightened self-awareness has regressed into a shocking lack of the same. LL Cool J's meaty ass bought a ticket on the suck train several years ago, accomplishing one of the most thorough sell-outs in recent memory. And I recently learned from VH1's ""Behind the Music"" that Busta Rhymes has heeded the advice of an oracle named P-Diddy, altering his rugged self-image to become hip-hop's estrogen-friendly answer to Barry White. (Though you certainly wouldn't know it from his current single, ""Break Ya Neck."") It appears from their latest release, AOI:Bionix, the second in their AOI trilogy, that De La Soul has managed to steer clear of similar ignominy. The trio, now in their third decade of existence, are well beyond the expiration date of some of their golden-era peers. But just when you thought De La, too, might go sour (see the trilogy's first installment), they hit you with the unexpected. And in doing so, they provide an obvious answer to the dilemma: target a new demographic. The new audience clearly likes things smooth. They appreciate family, love and maturity. They're the same group who've accounted for the explainable success of D'Angelo, the unexplainable success of Bilal, and possibly, the never-ending barrage of Morris Chestnut-laced, black, middle-class motion pictures (including such blockbusters as Waiting to Exhale, The Wood, and The Best Man-- where's my man Taye Diggs?). Straight up, AOI:Bionix takes a belt sander to hip-hop's rougher edges, resulting in refinement, sophistication and undeniable accessibility. The first single off Bionix, ""Baby Phat,"" draws from that eternal font of hip-hop inspiration: the shapely beauty of the black female physique. Its beat is oddly reminiscent of Toni Braxton, but that said, it's tight, and matches the breaks in the rhymes. ""Simply,"" a superior party anthem, takes familiarity to the next level, sampling Wings' ""Wonderful Christmas Time"" in the most glorious manner. The groove is smooth, and will undoubtedly be the soundtrack to some of the finest ""Soul Train"" lines to come. ""Held Down"" features Cee-Lo and a gospel choir with a soulful vocal chorus, delivered over a classic walking bassline a la Al Green. ""Watch Out"" is more emblematic of the De La of old; although the beat is built around a vibraphone, it hits pretty hard, and the rhymes are direct and incisive. But before we get too excited about Bionix, we must address its shortcomings, which are belated but apparent. On ""What We Do for Love,"" washed-up gay pimp Slick Rick once again manages to annoy and disturb. As if to provoke riots, De La Soul match Rick with an electronic harpsichord. (Should have matched him with a muzzle.) The situation doesn't improve much in the last few tracks, as B-Real displays a masterwork of character development on ""Peer Pressure,"" playing the challenging role of a conniving drug pusher. You go, B. In short, AOI:Bionix is to hip-hop what Grover Washington, Jr. was to jazz. It's smooth, well-produced, well-executed, and palatable. And, like Grover, it's probably a lot better than you think.","The aging of hip-hop presents a serious structural dilemma, similar to the one rock and roll faced a few decades ...

Kitchen U.S.A.,Twin Atlas,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84813d19756521395ff/1:1/w_160/a7bbdf2b.gif,2002-02-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8213-kitchen-usa/,Tappersize,"Some albums have to grow on you. Is it a cliché because it's true or is it true because it's a cliché? Don't ask me, man, I didn't come up with it. All I know is that I waited a long, long time for The Twin Atlas' second full-length, Kitchen U.S.A., to stand out from the slew of crap that usually resides at the bottom of my ""to-be-reviewed"" stack. But, on what seemed like the infinith listen, the band's home-brewed yet refined folk-rock sound-- something like if the Elephant 6 explosion had happened in Wales instead of the American South-- finally hit. The Twin Atlas is, as you might assume from the name, a duo-- Sean Byrne, who drums for both Lenola and Mazarin, and Lucas Zaleski-- and one of many bands wrestling with the specter of multi-city collaboration. But if their fecundity is any measure, they're handling it pretty well. There are 22 tracks on this album, and 26 on their out-of-print debut, 2000's The Philadelphia Parking Authority Must Die, representing a nearly unbroken streak of recording from January 1999 to March of last year. These are short songs, but they do have a great thematic consistency. Phrases, both musical and lyrical, repeat throughout, and some tracks are permutations of earlier ones, lending the whole thing a loose, concept album feel without actually taking that grandiose, pretentious step. The end result is that, by the end of the record, you feel an instant familiarity with the music. Nice. But while any dart thrown randomly at the Kitchen U.S.A. could strike a potential college radio hit, there are definite highs and lows. One of the standouts is ""When the Dawn Survives,"" a song that takes the most simplistic organ hook imaginable and layers it with guitars, mandolins, maracas, and some genuinely moving and evocative lyrical muscle. But if you don't laugh out loud at the lo-fi stylistic parroting of everyone's (least) favorite pompous Irish rockers on ""Where the Feet Have No Name,"" I'll give you a buck. Intentional or not, people don't need any more instrumental U2 in their lives. Still, the gorgeous harmonies on Kitchen U.S.A., if that's your bag, are truly the centerpiece here, and they generally deliver the goods. Sean and Lucas' voices blend perfectly, complementing each other like a true classic pop pairing. It's easy like Sunday morning. Just give it time.","Some albums have to grow on you.

Native Lab,Various Artists,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7feea9e61561daa56f8/1:1/w_160/7444c5e6.gif,2002-02-24 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2017-native-lab/,Komfort.LaborWMF,"The Berlin club night Native Lab is essentially a market research and sales tool. It's organized by Native Instruments, the designer and developer of the modular audio software, Reaktor. The Native Lab night is an opportunity for computer-based musicians to showcase their own material, but also plug the benefits of making Reaktor software as much as a part of your life as gravity. This latest edition of the inhospitably parenthesized and idiosyncratically punctuated [komfort.labor] series is less an opportunity for artists such as Kid 606, Vert, and Vladislav Delay, who have performed at Native Lab to reach a wider audience, than it is a gimmick to give a big plug for Native Instruments products. As far as I can tell, however, none of the thirteen tracks was actually recorded at Native Lab. Many of the tracks have been licensed from other labels and previous releases, which really makes me think that Native Instruments are implying that the artists featured on this disc endorse their products. In short, this is the IDM equivalent of Barry Bostwick slurping a Pepsi Twist. So marketing swizz concerns aside, how's the music? Well, compiler Mate Galic has an ear alert for bass-heavy, moderately glitchy club grooves. Kid 606 begins this unmixed set with ""Damn, Dre, Why You Always Hating on Me,"" a bouncy tech-house romp distinguished by some rather Fennesz-like guitar plucks. Jake Mandell, never one to disappoint, hands over the doomy Chain Reaction trance of ""Broccoli Crisis,"" which overcomes its ridiculous title and proves itself a fetching club monster. Mandell cuts the trademark Chain Reaction fog with orchestral stabs, as effective and as dated as when the Pet Shop Boys used them throughout 1988's Introspective. Excerpted from the Asect.Dsect EP, Richard Devine's ""Pulsion Mirror"" furthers Mandell's dancefloor mission and increases the speaker-freaking bass action. I find that Devine's tracks are usually some the most emotionless and academic of laptop-ery. But with a solid commitment to getting my gluteus gooey, Devine shows himself in quite a different and appealing light. Errorsmith takes the compilation away from dancefloor hedonism and into abstract processes with ""Free for All (Breaks Version),"" which he may have intended to be a lethal combination of the chromium-funk of Spectrum's ""Metal Master"" and the drifting opening minutes of Vapourspace's ""Gravitational Arch of Ten."" Except that Errorsmith's repetition of the same rhythmic pattern is as predictable as a French neo-disco cut-- you know when the panning will occur, the phasing, the mid-frequency drop-out. Perhaps ""Free for All (Breaks Version)"" is nothing more than Errorsmith's test-drive demonstration of how Reaktor handles such things. Mouse on Mars associate F.X. Randomiz returns to the days of ambient liquid sounds for ""Danuni,"" whereas Rob Acid (sounding more like his Atlon Inc. alias) drops some heavy ordinance to describe ""A Day in My Life."" Worm Interface's Solar X charms me with his Boards of Canada-derivative jump-up jungle and nursery rhyme fusion, ""Marmilad Sticker."" Vladislav Delay does nothing to impugn his reputation as reigning majesty of IDM with ""The Super Has Left the Model,"" which recalls his fractured Chicago jack tracks recorded under the Luomo and Uusitalo aliases. Siegmar Kreie, on the other hand, takes the glitch into territory previously unknown to me. Kreie's ""Zen Ist Nights Dagegen"" strikes me as if OMD's ""Architecture and Morality"" were reworked by gabba maniacs, and then re-reworked by Pete Namlook. ""Zen Ist Nights Dagegen"" is a roiling mass of contradictions, deftly contained by Kreie. Mike Dred brings the acid of his early Kosmik Kommando days up to date, puncturing his pure tone pulses with digitalized screams and searing stabs, and assuring himself Supremely Evil Entity status in the fledgling goth-glitch community. After Nitrada vs. Vger's atmospheric burbling called ""(Sky was blue)pow2,"" compiler Galic closes the session in Steve Reich-ian zombie illbient bhangra style (got that?) with Vert's ""Drawers of Water"" lifted from their Nine Types of Ambiguity LP. There's no escaping the fact that Native Lab is a sampler. If someone new to IDM picked up this compilation and attempted to come to some conclusions about, for example, Kid 606, he would be misled. This type of compilation will never accurately portray Kid 606's splattercore or Vladislav Delay's gently clattering, ever morphing-grooves. That concern aside, the record is far more cohesive than Mille Plateaux's Electric Ladyland: Clickhop version 1.0, which is stylistically similar. By maintaining a club focus, Native Lab proves that when the devil drives, these artists can unmistakably rock the party as well as satisfy MIT Media Lab grads.","The Berlin club night Native Lab is essentially a market research and sales tool.

Tanz der Lemminge,Amon Düül II,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0865e6ef9596931ff88/1:1/w_160/67fc7ec6.gif,2002-02-24 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/168-tanz-der-lemminge/,LibertyLiberty,"Amon Düül II rose from the communal pit of Amon Düül I, a group of beaters and stompers who made three albums culled from the chaos of a single tribe-jam session. The second outfit saw the madness in that situation, and decided to do their own thing, and not worry about getting a new name (or fighting too hard for the first one). Guitarist Chris Karrer took with him seven of the collective's best musicians, and they formed what is generally thought of as the better half of this family. They're usually aligned with Faust (not really a good comparison), Can (getting colder) and Neu! (might as well say ""Frank Sinatra""), but if indeed the band was ever typical ""krautrock,"" they were decidedly closer to the rambunctious prog-rock side (though comparing them to Yes is even worse), with a liberal dose of heavy psych. Amon Düül II was infinitely darker than most of their countrymen as well, with songs (or more accurately, suites) often running the gamut of proto-goth subjects: aliens, funerals, alien funerals-- they did it all. Of course, none of it would matter much without some seriously engaging music. I first got into Amon Düül II after a friend had compared Boredoms' Super Ae to their 1970 release, Yeti, and though that's a convenient reference, the German band were the far hairier proposition. Pounding rhythms, acid-attack guitar freak-outs, inappropriately wet reverb overdoses, and strange lyrics about H.G. Wells and toothpaste all contribute to the general strangeness that is an experience with the early works of this band. 1971's Tanz der Lemminge (Dance of the Lemmings) was the band's third album, and though they'd already taken the pedal off the spacy, overdriven metal a bit, it's still a sight removed from the pop charts. By that point, only Karrer, John Weinzierl (guitar), Lothar Meid (bass), Falk Rogner (organ) and Peter Leopold (drums) remained from the original group (plus a few guests), though that didn't stop them from filling up their second double LP in a row. The sound is something like old school Jethro Tull (uh-huh, though sans-flute) with so many odd sonic detours as to make the prospect of not one, not two, but three full-grown, epic-length goth-prog tunes (and some group improv to boot) not as daunting as it could be. And for the record, this stuff rocks the haus. ""Syntelman's March of the Roaring Seventies,"" at almost 16 minutes, is actually the shortest of the epics on Lemminge. Unlike Can, whose Tago Mago was released shortly after this album, Amon Düül II's lengthy pieces are generally fleshed out works, rather than pure studio concoctions and pastiches of improvisation or shorter segments. ""Syntelman's"" starts ominously enough with a wall of chimes and distant organ tones, but the insistent bass and drum groove boils to the surface, with Karrer's acoustic guitar (which is a major component on the album, and one reason why it feels less a hazy workout than previous releases) working over top, and even some light mellotron (sounding like a choir of children) to give it sci-fi charm. ""After a long introducing, you can listen to the story,"" says the singer, and so another light acoustic guitar interlude brings in the next section. The band may have been influenced by Space Oddity-era Bowie, as many of the pieces featuring song-like sections are reminiscent of Bowie's more whimsical outings. All things considered, this is a pretty warm introduction to the band, if you were so inclined. ""Restless Skylight-Transistor Child"" begins with one of about a hundred classic riffs featured on Lemminge-- and if there's one major difference between this album and its predecessors, it's the noticeable increase in major league, hard rock riffery. This leads to a completely different, though equally classic riff, and to still another riff after that. The last one, though, brings it down a notch, and even introduces some nice sitar to the mix. Where this band has distanced itself from the other krautrock bands is its unrelenting eclecticism and variety in its arrangements. Even Faust couldn't claim as many points of reference points as this tune: after the rocking intro, it goes to ghostly freak ambience, then to Musique Concrète broken carousel, onto über-Foghat territory with riffs aplenty, then to something that sounds like it was ripped off of the first Funkadelic album with Hendrix guitar and big beats, and then a crazy gypsy violin goes apeshit. See? The final grossewerk is perhaps the centerpiece of the record, ""Chamsin Soundtrack/The Marilyn Monroe Memorial Church."" Where the previous pieces were long, they weren't necessarily mind-expanding (which is what I expect from the best Amon Düül II), and this piece makes up for that in spades. Beginning with cloudy, undefined organ/feedback ambience-- and with a little ancient violin lament here, future-shock noise there-- it is positively haunting. Percussion enters sporadically, though this piece is certainly not about groove. Romantic, heavenly organ repeats what the violin only hinted at earlier, and I'm taken to the next plane in space-rock. Pretenders usually wuss out by including some ridiculous spoken word thing or, even worse, start playing a guitar solo. Not these guys; after the organ, more sound affects and disembodied instrumental embellishments ensue, with the most horrific being the pounded piano about twelve minutes in. As psychedelic noise symphonies go, this is in a class all by itself. Three shorter pieces end the album, most likely as sobering agents after the preceding journeys. ""Chewinggum Telegram"" is a fairly standard, early-70s hard rock jam, while ""Stumbling over Melted Moonlight"" takes out the funky trash and introduces the best demonic riff Black Sabbath never played. The end of the tune turns everything inside out, as the drums get filtered through what sounds like a telephone wire, and the guitar is replaced by weightless organ. The closer, ""Toxicological Whispering"" continues the end-jam, though with a lazy, repetitive riff more suited to closing your eyes and letting life drift by than just about anything else. This is not my favorite Amon Düül II record, but it may be the best introduction to the band. Records like Yeti and Phallus Dei are fiercer (and certainly louder), but don't really cover the ground Lemminge does. And in fact, the band did slowly recede into commercialism throughout the 70s (though by no means immediately, as the two records after this one were almost as good), so it's possible this record just marked their transition into a calmer, gentler beast. But, a beast they were (and in some form, still are, for which their recent reunion testifies), and most folks are happy/horrified with as much.","Amon Düül II rose from the communal pit of Amon Düül I, a group of beaters...

A Jackson in Your House/Message to Our Folks,Art Ensemble of Chicago,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10ac0084474cd0bfd05/1:1/w_160/5bc6224f.jpg,2002-02-21 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11643-a-jackson-in-your-housemessage-to-our-folks/,ActuelActuel,"The Art Ensemble of Chicago is one of the most enduring units dedicated to free improvisation and modern jazz composition in existence. They began as a series of projects led by saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell, a member of the Illinois-based non-profit Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians which is dedicated to nurturing serious, original music in Chicago's black community. In 1968, after working with several small groups, Mitchell found himself with a great line-up: himself (naturally), bassist Malachi Flavors, trumpeter Lester Bowie and saxophonist Joseph Jarman. At that point, the group was still known as Roscoe Mitchell's Art Ensemble, and they actually recorded a couple of early records for both the Nessa imprint (Sound, which debuted what would become the defining sound of the AACM) and Delmark (Numbers 1 & 2). Ironically, the group wasn't even known as the Art Ensemble of Chicago until they relocated to Paris in 1969. A Jackson in Your House (recorded June 23, 1969) and Message to Our Folks (August 12, 1969), both just reissued on one disc from Actuel Records, were originally recorded in Paris for the BYG label, and before percussionist Famoudou Don Moye had joined the band. For the most part, the music on these early records is a direct indication of the kind of projects the musicians had previously been involved with: free improvisation; counterpoint and modern European classical music; traditionally minded attempts to integrate African music into their sound; a significant theatric influence. The combination of these elements immediately distinguished the Art Ensemble from almost every other improvising group of the time. But there was more to them than that. Their embrace of vaudevillian humor, sometimes delivered in the form of strange spoken word sections or rough skits, lent their records a unique kind of levity that couldn't be found in the ultra-serious expressionism of peers like Albert Ayler and Pharoah Sanders. The first record begins with its title track, and encapsulates many of the Art Ensemble's strengths, though in somewhat sprawling form: faux-theatric whimsy, classic jazz forms, and even some strange form of world music. And all in five minutes! But the song, while definitely offering an interesting overall mixture of sounds, can be a tad too much for me at times. Things come together better on the next song, ""Get In Line."" Here, the group again relies on the vaudevillian, opening with a rollercoaster head (not unlike something you might hear on a John Zorn bebop record) and gradually transforming into a burlesque march while someone shouts out the track's namesake. Then, with no warning whatsoever, begins four minutes of prime chaos. Saxes go ballistic like predatory beasts, Malachi Flavors busts out blistering acoustic basslines, and what little percussion there is spins wildly out of control. Next thing you know, someone's sounding a gong, like the cops raiding a party with hoses and smoke bombs, and the track grinds recklessly to a halt. Intense. Things get much more civil on ""The Waltz,"" a very short (though typically referential) waltz spotlighting the band's ease with restrained arrangements while hinting at the bawdy, dignified old-time jazz these guys obviously love. Too bad the tune is just over a minute long, because it's easily the most focused on the disc. The other tracks are quite daring, and even passionate, but possibly rough drafts. That's not a crime (especially in jazz), but it does make it just a tad harder to take in all at once. Of course, ""Song for Charles"" is the centerpiece of the first album, and not just because it's longer than all of the previous tracks combined. It begins as an extension of Jarman's delicate beat poem ""Ericka,"" but dissolves into free, lyrical phrasing from the horns and bass (with Flavors sounding eerily like a rather wired Scott LaFaro). Soon, a vibraphone enters, as Bowie and Mitchell turn a small figure into a very emphatic five-note melody, proclaiming who knows what grandeur. This moment of clarity is quite brief, though, as the group improvisation quickly begins, and in full exploratory mode. The mammoth session seems like abstract impressionism, but what impression? Sometimes strange and distorted, sometimes cold, sometimes resembling a traditional jazz torch song (especially during Bowie's soliloquy about nine minutes in). This is heady stuff, and though I can hear the dedication in the performance, sometimes the feeling loses me. The second album on the disc, Message to Our Folks, opens with an arrangement of ""Old Time Religion,"" replete with an introductory sermon and responses from the ""congregation."" Ominous bowed bass and cymbal splashes allow the exposition to hover until the proper tune kicks in. The horns hold steady all the way up until the last minute, when they drop a hard, swinging head. But already, this record feels a lot more serious than A Jackson in Your House. Charlie Parker's ""Dexterity"" gets the post-modern treatment (quite a feat back in 1969), as Bowie and Mitchell play the tune straight enough, but blow a hole through the speakers during the solo. There are grunts, an accompanying triangle, and even something like be-bop drums. And they pull a similar stylistic leap on ""Rock Out"" which sounds like an abstract take on James Brown-style soul-funk. The bassline actually feels curiously lifted from ""I Got You (I Feel Good),"" and whoever's playing drums is doing a mean Jabo Starks impersonation. Things really get interesting when Mitchell comes in with a mean solo, spikier than anything Maceo Parker blew in those days. Since the Art Ensemble were trying to unite so many forms of ""Great Black Music"" (a term coined by the AACM to describe its own musical direction, but also applicable to so many other artists), bringing in funk and rock was a natural step. Again, the band ends with a sidelong piece, ""A Brain for the Seine."" This is no less challenging than ""Song for Charles"" was, and is in many ways further adrift of contemporary jazz (even in the avant-garde). Bowie begins with a somber, muted statement, with what sounds like an accordion and jingle bells helping him along. This very clearly breaks into distant percussion, speaking, and something like tools banging against wood. ""Please, may I have a drink of water?"" says one narrator, and a zither sounds. Bowie removes the mute, Flavors bows ever persistently, and still more exotic percussion and mallets make entrances and exits. Perhaps this is a treatise on economic symphonic arrangements, or maybe they're just that eclectic to include so many timbres in a short time span (and even at 20 minutes, they manage to get in more than most artists do in three albums). This record, a logical progression from A Jackson in Your House (as well as major source of sampling for Amon Tobin's 1997 masterpiece Bricolage), seems to have more at stake than its predecessor. But both serve as a good indication of the heights the group would scale over the course of the next few decades. Step forward, have patience, and be ready for anything.","

Geogaddi,Boards of Canada,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a330b1335d7bf1698685/1:1/w_160/068497d8.jpg,2002-02-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/,Warp,"It's a bit of a stretch, but a while ago I compared Boards of Canada's seminal Music Has the Right to Children with Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. I wasn't saying anything about the similarity or relative quality of the actual music, of course; I was just making an observation about how each album has a remarkably wide appeal that stretches beyond fans of its respective genre, while simultaneously carrying great weight with more experienced and discerning listeners. Because of this dual nature, both records are considered ideal ""first purchases"" for those curious about the musical world they come from. The comparison fails in other respects, but there's no doubting the consensus of opinion that has formed around these records, shared among both newcomers and schooled aesthetes. The reputation of Music Has the Right to Children has everything to do with why Geogaddi is one of the most anticipated records of 2002 for indie and electronic music fans of all stripes. It's been four long years since this Scottish duo's landmark debut, and during this time, we've seen an uncountable number of ""kind of like Boards of Canada"" bands drifting by, with only a toddler's handful of new material released by the Boards themselves-- namely, the In a Beautiful Place out in the Country EP, released in late 2000. As Marcus Eoin and Michael Sandison toiled away in secrecy in their Hexagon Sun studio and remote artists' compound, fans speculated about possible new directions: where would they go next? Geogaddi provides a clear answer: not so far, really. As similar as this album is to the rest of the band's catalog, it seems a safe speculation that the concept of ""reinvention"" is not part of the Boards of Canada M.O. Their exceptionally distinctive and oft-imitated sound emerged fully formed on the early EPs, and for now, at least, they're sticking with it. While some will complain about Boards of Canada's failure to cover new territory, which puts them apart from the praised eclectic ""searchers"" of the music scene (Miles made only made one stab at Kind of Blue before moving on, after all), the rest of us will delight in what we see as a very accomplished album packed with great music. When it comes to discussing records, though, similarities are boring, so let's talk about what makes Geogaddi different. The first thing that comes to mind is the shift in mood. While the band continues to traffic in childhood and nostalgia, the atmosphere on this album is a shade darker than on previous releases, and comparatively tense with a noticeable thread of paranoia. Boards of Canada have always had a disorienting cast to their music, in part because of their proclivity for the quivery modulation of their analog synths. But where the warbles once seemed designed to evoke the sensation of strained memory, the distortions now have a disturbing undercurrent, suggesting that something frightening might lie beneath the surface. Part of this darker trend comes from a thicker production environment and apparent aversion to unused space. On Geogaddi, Boards of Canada have replaced silence with the drone, and the master tapes are saturated with the sounds of the duo's customized machinery. There's none of the wistful airiness of a track like ""Turquoise Hexagon Sun,"" nor the lighthearted warmth of a Music Has the Right to Children track like ""Aquarius."" Gone, too, is the gentle pastoralism of In a Beautiful Place out in the Country. In its place, we find the swirling claustrophobic winds of ""Julie and Candy,"" menacing swells of feedback anchoring the rhythm of ""Dawn Chorus,"" and the lonely, isolated Nuno Cannavaro-isms of ""The Devil Is in the Details,"" whose two sampled voices are a crying baby and a monolog given by a woman who might be drowning. Some of the beats on Geogaddi compliment this new, darker undercurrent and stand out from previous work. The pummeling, mechanized drum loop that drives ""Gyroscope"" is downright violent, and seems squarely aimed at the distorted child's voice in the background. And on ""Alpha and Omega,"" hints of tabla mix with multi-layered percussion, lending an intriguing live band feel to an otherwise unremarkable track. So, yes, the Boards have implemented their trademark tools on Geogaddi, but in the service of a slightly gloomier vision. Granted, the familiarity of their sound could prove to become a liability on their future releases, but it's easy to see why Eoin and Sandison have played this record so close to the vest. If you'd perfected a sonic playground like this, you'd probably want to explore it a while longer, too.","It's a bit of a stretch, but a while ago I compared Boards of Canada's seminal Music Has ...

Straight from the Fridge,James Hardway,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c06013d197565213ba2d/1:1/w_160/d326b151.jpg,2002-02-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3744-straight-from-the-fridge/,Hydrogen Dukebox,"David Harrow has been many things in his career. Under a multiplicity of monikers he's remixed Depeche Mode (""Enjoy the Silence"") and the Orb (""Asylum""), and worked with Adrian Sherwood's On-U Sound System, Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart, and Psychic TV. Harrow's most lucrative credit, though, is for writing Billie Ray Martin's Euro dance monster, ""Your Loving Arms."" He even explored ethno-techno as Technova and laptop jungle as Magnetic for releases on Andrew Weatherall's Emissions Audio Output label. But James Hardway is Dave Harrow's hardest working alias. Straight from the Fridge is Harrow's fifth full-length excursion as James Hardway, and it incorporates many of the Afro-Cubanisms that dominated his previous album, Moors and Christians, into the jazzy drum-n-bass of earlier outings. Straight from the Fridge launches into the St. Germain-style dancefloor jazz of ""Happiness Brakes."" To a bucking accompaniment of grimy Hammond B-3 organ stabs, Invader of the Heart Clive Bell sends flute curlicues flitting above and in between scurrying muted horns. The track is so deftly syncopated that its 4/4 kick drum stomp is almost superfluous. For ""Earth Runnings,"" Harrow sets up spacy synths that lurk in the background and wisp past vocalist J.B. Bell's sultry, spoken-word vocals. ""Andrea's Chimes"" is a gorgeous piano doodle that segues into the world-weary voice of Floyd Batts and his ""Danger Blue"" lament. Here, Hardway has sampled Batts' song (originally recorded in 1959 at the Parchman Mississippi State Penitentiary) and surrounded it with xylophone lines and burdensome shackles of piano chords. Fortunately, the song avoids the oafishness that usually accompanies disco-fied blues hollers. Hardway's setting is so complimentary and seamless that if I didn't know Batts' vocal was an incorporated recording, I could not have guessed. Ghetto Priest makes a couple of appearances here, too, ripping loose some fiery dancehall chat over the kind of fierce acoustic bass that should by now be familiar to longtime Hardway albums. Priest gets nuff respect from me by referencing both Admiral Bailey's Casiotone raga classic ""Jump Up"" and Death in Vegas's digital rudie ""Jump and Twist"" throughout ""Jump Up Natural."" He also proves himself more than just a rasping raggamuffin during the consciousness ballad ""Speak Softly,"" on which he gives up a fine Bim Sherman impression. ""Can't Slow Down"" approaches cosmic-jazz territory with a reed-thin swooping synthline zipping through a percussive barrage. With a solo trumpet blast similar to the one heard in Sinéad O'Connor's ""Fire on Babylon,"" the middle-eastern tonalities of the unfittingly named ""Uptown"" is an immediate link to Moors and Christians. With its Hammond organ filling in spaces between sirocco-surfing horns and a skittering piano figure, the song recalls jazz-folkster Glen Moore's bass-heavy growler, ""Moot."" As Hardway records go, Straight from the Fridge is succinct and infectiously strong. Unlike previous outings, this record rents no space to noodly weaklings such as ""Our Cousin Frank"" (from A Positive Sweat). I'm already thirsty for another frosty cool one from Hardway's icebox.","David Harrow has been many things in his career. Under a multiplicity of monikers\n\ he's remixed Depeche Mode ...

"This World, Then the Fireworks",Witch Hazel Sound,by: David M.

Now they've changed their name to the Witch Hazel Sound. With a name like that, you can tell these guys want to be thought of as something different. Theirs is a unique sound, man-- one unlike anything you've heard before, one deserving of a name all its own. Ahh, if only this were the case. If only this album were unique, then I'd know what to say about it. At best, I could heap on gushing praise. At worst, I could tear it to shreds with my most vicious turns of phrase. But the Witch Hazel Sound is, quite unfortunately, not really worthy of its own subgenre. Theirs is a brand of pop-rock we've heard a thousand times before; yet another in a seemingly infinite line of would-be 60s pop-rockers born a few decades too late. Indeed, the Witch Hazel Sound is almost indistinguishable from say, the Elephant Six Sound. It's one made from layered instruments and harmonies, one full of horns and organs and backup singers. It's not even a bad sound, really-- just one that begs the question, ""Does this really need to be done again?"" Which leaves me in a tough spot. What's to say about an album like This World, Then the Fireworks that hasn't been said a thousand times before about a thousand similar albums? I suppose I could tell you about the arrangements, but the band's liberal use of trumpets, saxophones, and organs, which seem to exist only to supplement their otherwise traditional sound, are just not that spectacular. I could talk about how the vocals and musicianship are remarkably competent (though never anything more). And I guess I could talk about the neat little flourishes the groups adds here and there-- like the way ""Kiss Me Monster"" begins with one of the most familiar words in all of 60s pop-rock (""Hello Darkness""), and continues with traditional vocal harmonizing and a wistful aesthetic, yet somehow manages to do it in a way that doesn't seem derivative of Simon and Garfunkel. Or, hey, while we're on the subject, I could even tell you about the guitar part that plays backwards over the end of ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,"" creating a sound that's at once familiar and alien. Maybe I could gush about ""Providence,"" a charming instrumental right out of a cartoon, comprised entirely of organ and vibraphone. Friends, I could mention all of these things. And in between I could use phrases like ""jangly guitars"" or ""harmonies like a summer breeze."" But that would leave you without any knowledge of the lyrical content, which, predictably, consists of your standard, innocuous pop song fare. (This, incidentally, would be better left unmentioned.) And what of the song structures? Shouldn't you be told that-- with the exception of a few short instrumental numbers, and the simple yet charming ""Guild of Splinters""-- they're about as predictable as they come? Yes, you should be told. And you should also be told that the Witch Hazel Sound, while often painfully unremarkable, aren't truly deserving of critical beatdown. Because along with being too ordinary to love, they're also far too pleasant to hate. This, after all, is a decent bunch of reasonably talented guys, and the music they create is certainly harmless enough. They never get as tooth-rottingly sweet as the Apples in Stereo in their most grating moments, nor do they ever succumb to the absurd pretensions that occasionally drag down Of Montreal. Yet, without such possibility of failure lurking over their shoulders, the songs on This World, Then the Fireworks ultimately all sound a bit too alike. In a market glutted with 1960s style pop music, these guys seem designed to fade into the background. And I realize that you're reading this because you want me to tell you these things. But fuck, I just don't know where to start.","Originally, these guys were just plain ""Witch Hazel."" Now they've changed their name to the Witch Hazel Sound. With ...

From Here On In,South,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e99d034d5c69bf3195/1:1/w_160/0cea0866.jpg,2002-02-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7381-from-here-on-in/,KineticMo'Wax,"Is it electronica chopped up into pop songs? Or a collection of hookless pop that props up gorgeous electronic effects? It's hard to be absolutely certain, but I can tell you one thing: for all the work that went into their debut, British band South failed to fully deliver on their hype. Sad, too, because From Here On In is inches away from being a success. It's just that it's weighed down by so many repetitive textures and songs that fail to impact. Joel Cadbury handles most of the vocals and routinely swaps drums, bass, keyboards and guitar with Brett Shaw and Jamie McDonald. And on a few of these tracks, they make a straightforward Brit-pop combo. You can hear echoes of some 90s Manchester bands like the Stone Roses and possibly a less glamour-stricken Suede, and the piano and vocals-- particularly on ""Keep Close""-- are reminiscent of John Lennon (or at least Julian). But the guys only turn out one solid rock song, the orchestral ""Paint the Silence,"" and the appealing but derivative ""Here On In."" The latter, a summer-day power ballad with acoustic guitars and pastoral keyboards, builds to a beautiful, aching climax while Cadbury intones the chorus, surrounded by smashed drumkits and mangled guitars. With songs like this, South has the potential to be a great bliss-pop band. But pop isn't enough for South, and when they hit the studio, things got a little crazy. South co-produced the album with James Lavelle, the head of acid jazz label Mo'Wax (which released From Here On In in Britain) and the man behind U.N.K.L.E.; he collaborated with DJ Shadow on the 1998 hit Psyence Fiction, an album widely recognized for sounding great but not actually being great. But, possibly due to Lavelle's influence, or maybe their own excessive facility in the studio, South was a bit liberal with the sounds and effects on this album, and not necessarily in a good way. In fact, many of these songs mercilessly work a beat without ever taking it anywhere. The instrumentals have a driven pace, but they end up as static ""variations on a groove,"" if you'll pardon my soul-professor terminology. South includes three separate versions of ""Broken Head,"" each longer and less interesting than the last. ""All In for Nothing (Reprise)"" kicks off with a terrific drumbeat and soaring keyboards (or guitars?), but loses its effect after stagnating for the remaining four minutes. Many of the pop songs are also drowned with texture: ""All in for Nothing"" becomes vague and indistinct as the band turns it into a canvas for the beats and keyboards. Even some of the simpler songs suffer from a short attention span. ""Keep Close"" already works as a straightforward song, but the guys can't resist the urge to play with the vocal mix or tack a gloomy instrumental onto the end. This is even more unfortunate considering that the band actually sounds terrific. The drumming is crisp and limber, and I can't get enough of their basslines. Occasionally, they hit a song with everything they've got and it all comes together: ""Sight of Me"" segues well from the slower body of the song to a solid dance outro. But the overall impression is of long stretches with little to warrant attention; the arrangements are muddied by too many textures and the tracklist relies too heavily on dirges, such as the back-to-back woe of ""Recovered Now,"" ""Southern Climes"" and ""By the Time You Catch Your Heart."" With a running time of seventy minutes, all the good parts get buried. Last year, South worked with Lavelle on the soundtrack to Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast, and if you've seen the film, you've heard the stuff South excels at: slightly lo-fi atmospheric music that's great in small doses and works well behind scenes of criminals breaking into vaults and dreaming about hairy monsters. But the best musical moment of that film comes from punk band the Stranglers, during the title sequence: there's a shot of Ray Winstone, several pounds overweight with his leathery, bare gut hanging out over tight Speedos, stumbling next to the pool. As his groin hangs in the middle of the screen for way, way too long, the Stranglers play a little song called ""Peaches"" whose concise drums and raunchy organ mocks the scene perfectly. If South had pushed themselves to make one great moment like that, or really anything that evokes images of Ray's fleshy thigh, we might have had something a little stickier on our hands.","Is it electronica chopped up into pop songs?

Moth and Marriage,The Zincs,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab3913d1975652139b89/1:1/w_160/97ba6a7d.gif,2002-02-20 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8937-moth-and-marriage/,Ohio Gold,"Back in the day, I couldn't listen to any music that wasn't super high in fidelity. I was weaned on pop radio, and anything less than ""the best"" sounded like chicken-scratch. It took me a few years, but eventually I came to appreciate the immediacy of more raw recordings. Now I have a distaste for music that sounds too glossy. It works in intricate electronic music and R&B;, but when I hear a rock band with that overproduced sheen it leaves a bad taste in my mouth-- it's hard for me to avoid the sense that there's a certain lifestyle being sold along with the music. I'm just glad my tastes turned tail, because five years ago, I might have been all over this stuff. The Zincs isn't so much a band as it is the work of one man, Jim Elkington (aka Jim Zinc). He's from London, but like so many mystifying Brits, his accent virtually disappears when he sings. Elkington's voice sounds rich and worn with age-- a weathered old bastard like Paul Weller or Mark Lanegan-- but his music is a twangy breed of rock-and-roll that seems sure to have come out of the rural American Midwest. Yet, the Ohio Gold label is actually based in Chicago, Elkington's current home. The Zincs might get accused of being alt-country, but the little details Elkington spreads throughout his songs keep the album from being pigeonholed as part of the No Depression scene. ""I Remember"" begins with strange, whining electronics and Elkington's vibrant finger-picking. Halfway through, the song shifts suddenly into searing guitar distortion, then back to the melody before this short, slow little introduction ends. ""Two Patients"" picks up with a bender of a groove, punchdrunk guitars swerving back and forth across the lines set down by the bass and drums. ""I had forgotten what it means to be scared,"" Elkington sings, but he sounds far from cowed. ""Never Endeavour"" reveals a more vulnerable side. Jim breathes reassurances (""we'll weather together away from the cold""), and the soft guitars and drums fade into an organ solo that restates the main melody really sweetly. On ""Opening Time,"" the deliberate snare-tick and acoustic strum paint a lazy picture that doesn't need to be elaborated upon beyond the song title; Elkington asks, ""Close your eyes, were they closed all the time?"" and the mellow slide guitar admits as much. It's a drinking song, and there seem to be a few of them on Moth and Marriage, but while each is world-weary they're also heart-warming. ""Whisper in the Well"" is built around a dismal chorus (""There's a whisper in the well tonight/ Soak this parasite""), but the meandering guitar jangle, tambourine and repetitious hook make it dirge so good. ""X in Executor"" cranks the volume as Elkington yowls distortedly into the mic and layers of guitars weave together in pure Wowee-Zowee-era Pavement chaos. With the album closer, ""In the Hallway,"" Elkington returns to the experimental vibe, stroking the nylon strings of his guitar into a complex melody that slows to a crawl and ends in forlorn harmonica notes. While he pockmarks his songs with odd electronic touches and drones here and there, Elkington's first and foremost concerned with songwriting. And he never takes himself too seriously-- there's a current of dry humor running through the record, as on the bossanova-tinged ""The Elemental"" where he takes a dive towards self-mockery: ""Show me the list of affectations/ I can do all of them without a stop."" I guess the Zincs' name came from the galvanizing property of the ore: I listen to this on the way to work in the morning, and it gives me a boost.","Back in the day, I couldn't listen to any music that wasn't super high in fidelity.

Skeleton Key was pretty cool. They wrote good rock songs and banged on garbage cans. Capitol Records took notice. They signed Skeleton Key. And then, as often happens in the music industry, they fucked the band thoroughly and vigorously. Skeleton Key's one proper album, Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon, got less than no promotion, failed to gain the kind of support it no doubt would've garnered from an indie label, and was later yanked out of print. Skeleton Key lost their limbs on the battlefield of alternative music, and it turned out to be a fatal wound. In the military, they have the Purple Heart for people who meet such a fate. A thoughtful, kind token to say, ""Hey, dude, sorry we sent you to have your knee blown off in 'Nam""-- a gesture of appreciation for someone who was screwed over in service. The music industry has never been particularly good about showing appreciation for its soldiers. Unless you consider Jethro Tull ""fuckin' hardcore,"" the Grammy is essentially a joke. Awards are only given to the so-called heroes of the business. But what of the wounded? What recognition do the poor souls who have been reduced to collateral damage by the thoughtless machinations of the record industry receive? Erik Sanko and his bandmates should have, at the very least, each received a medal, depicting in fine bronze and gold engraving a musician being brutally raped by a smiling record exec. Fortunately, a little piece of metal probably wouldn't have mattered all that much to the boys of Skeleton Key, who have since gone on to plenty of other projects. Junk percussionist Rick Lee and drummer Steve Calhoon formed Enon with ex-Brainiac guitarist John Schmersal. And now, frontman Erik Sanko has returned with a pleasant, if not terribly exciting, solo record on a friendly little label. Past Imperfect, Present Tense is a solo album in the truest sense of the term-- every single note on the album is composed and played by Sanko himself. Given that Erik is primarily a guitarist with an interest in keyboards and strange noises, it makes sense that this record would be a more subdued effort than the tattered junkyard jams of Skeleton Key. Indeed, Sanko's guitar and voice, with some additional atmospherics provided by subtle effects and keyboard flourishes, constitute the album's core. Sanko is, without question, a talented man, both as a performer and a songwriter. But, despite the fact that Past Imperfect sprung entirely from the loins of a single creator, it only occasionally registers as particularly affecting. When it does register, however, it does so with remarkable elegance and style-- there are a few moments here that are absolutely intriguing. The shaky, slithery synthesizer part that appears throughout ""The Perfect Flaw"" is utterly entrancing, and the track is this incarnation of Sanko at his finest-- subtle, downcast, and vaguely haunting. Hints of this run through the album as a whole, but are rarely developed enough to yield truly potent results. Much of Past Imperfect seems to rely on a similar formula-- a sparse, usually minor guitar figure, a shaky vocal melody, and some atmospherics thrown in for good measure. Sanko manages to use this recipe to pretty good effect, too, on occasion, such as in ""While You Were Out,"" a song that occasionally bears an uncanny resemblance to the live version of Radiohead's ""Like Spinning Plates."" With ""That Train,"" Sanko picks up the pace a bit, but the Spartan arrangement and lack of change in dynamics tethers the song to the tag ""pretty good."" Aside from a few deeply hypnotic moments, Sanko's isolation doesn't really seem to help Past Imperfect much. A more diverse range of sounds would have benefited the album greatly. As Sanko surely knows, the music world can be a cruel, horribly unfair place. It's best not to face such things alone.","Once upon a time, Erik Sanko was the frontman for a band called Skeleton Key.

Regeneration,The Divine Comedy,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a5c0084474cd0c266b/1:1/w_160/e49dadf3.jpg,2002-02-20 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2341-regeneration/,Nettwerk,"The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon openly admits in interviews that he's never actually read the book his band is named after. I've always found this somewhat amusing, especially considering how literate the man is otherwise. Hell, his second album has a track that consists of nothing but him naming off great authors over a baroque arrangement, and his first ends with a Wordsworth poem put to music. Recently divorced from the Setanta label (amicably), Hannon shows up on Parlophone with a seven-piece band (including himself), apparently ready for a change in direction. For Regeneration, Hannon more or less leaves the orchestras and superhuman wit of past offerings at the door, mostly opting to treat the Divine Comedy as a self-contained band for the first time since their disowned first album, Fanfare for the Comic Muse. Back then, the group was still a guitar/bass/drums trio on the Northern Irish club circuit. To help realize this relatively stripped-down approach, Hannon and his newly solidified lineup called in über-producer Nigel Godrich, who at the time was fresh off helping Radiohead realize Kid A and Amnesiac. Godrich's recent work actually surfaces in quite a few places on Regeneration, though the little ambient noises and the tape-manipulated wash of sound that close ""Eye of the Needle"" represent the only time they really come to the fore. Those same atmospheric flourishes color the edges of much of the rest of the album, though, giving it an overall sonic unity and depth that works well in the absence of the usual soundwall present on Divine Comedy records. The album opens with one of Hannon's reliably depressing musings on life and time, entitled ""Timestretched."" ""There's not enough hours in the day to say all that I want to say,"" he sings, later offering that ""there's not enough lines on the stave to capture the music I crave."" His distinctive low baritone sounds as good as ever, and throughout most of the album, he remains considerably more reserved in his delivery than he ever used to, steering clear of the manic yelling of ""Charge"" or the cheeky operatics of ""Sweden."" On the one hand, this aids the low-key subject matter he's dealing with here, but on the other, it makes for a rather less interesting listen. That said, there's not a bad song to be found anywhere on this disc, and it remains engaging for nearly its entire duration, only falling into the background in a few isolated spots. Mostly, though, there's gold a-plenty to be mined from a song like ""Perfect Lovesong,"" which comes close to making good on its title. ""Give me your love and I'll give you the perfect lovesong/ With a divine Beatles bassline and a big old Beach Boys sound,"" he proposes, just as Joby Talbot launches a recorder countermelody sweet enough for ""Sloop John B."" It's matched by understated glockenspiel and echoing auxiliary percussion, all on top of a loping, easy-going beat that makes it hard not to bob your head. ""Note to Self"" follows with slinking guitars and a steady beat before breaking into the crashing bridge, where Hannon cries out ""what the fuck is happening?"" like he really doesn't know. ""Monday/ Restate my assumptions/ Heaven and Hell do not exist,"" go the song's opening lines, and the band does a fine job of echoing that uneasy sentiment with the music. The mix is densely layered, and multiple listens reveal small blasts of feedback, squirming keyboards and other disconcerting noises which, buried throughout the song, heighten anxiety with their subtle presence. ""Lost Property"" plays with imagery, naming off raincoats, tennis rackets, and other lost objects as a metaphor for the passage of time and moments that really matter to us over arpeggiating piano and a subtle string arrangement. The aforementioned ""Eye of the Needle"" follows, with Stuart Bates' treated trombone blending with electronic effects for an unusual background texture. Hannon reels off some great imagery and commentary with lines like, ""The cars in the churchyard/ Are shiny and German/ Distinctly at odds with/ The theme of the sermon."" The song's Spartan arrangement and placement in the middle of the album work together to provide some needed variety and segues perfectly into ""Love What You Do,"" the album's most obvious single. The verses are doused in glockenspiel and well-blended synth and recorder, while the chorus positively soars on electric piano ostinatos and fluid bass. The rest of the album is characterized by somewhat colder textures, like the guitars that don't really sound like guitars on the chorus of ""Dumb It Down"" and the meandering piano on ""Mastermind."" The second verse of ""Dumb It Down"" bends and warps with post-production effects, a surprisingly avant-garde move that works quite well. ""Mastermind"" is subdued and largely acoustic, aside from sonar-like sound effects. Hannon ends it with the line, ""All the dreams that we have had are gonna prove that we're all mad/ And that's okay."" The title track gets even chillier on the verses, with icy piano and hushed vocals, and even refuses to warm up when Ivor Talbot's guitar rips it open for the two bridges. ""The Beauty Regime"" closes things off on a warmer note, with its 70s R&B-influenced; rhythm section and ultimately inspirational message. Hannon tears into the plethora of modern image-oriented magazines that clog the shelves these days, exhorting the listener to forget everything they've read there and just live life. It's strange how such a ridiculous cliche manages to sound convincing coming at the end of an album like this. The thing is, no matter what he says, Hannon sounds utterly sincere, and that's what really drives his message home. In the end, Regeneration turns out to be a validating listen, much like the Divine Comedy's past efforts. It's certainly a lot less melodramatic, and that's both a strength and a weakness. The music is great, and the honesty is refreshing, but sometimes I miss the old Hannon-- insecure, but brash nonetheless, and witty as hell. The past aside, Regeneration delivers, and often brilliantly. Dante would be proud, even if Hannon still hasn't read his book.","The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon openly admits in interviews that he's never\n\ actually read the book his ...

Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves,Champagne Kiss,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a580ea9e61561daa515b/1:1/w_160/0485ed4d.gif,2002-02-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1395-dancing-in-the-pockets-of-thieves/,Troubleman Unlimited,"""Do you hear that? Now don't turn around-- something's coming up behind you. It's coming closer and closer and closer..."" No, it's not John Ashcroft and his Legion of Lawless Thugs, though he might have a question or two for you if you're of middle-Eastern descent. The above sample begins Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves. Warped distortion sounds accelerate, and a disembodied voice croaks, ""Not wanting to be found."" This short intro segues to the brutal rage of ""Cement Is Blue."" It sounds like hardcore punk thrust through an oscillating fan, what with the constant clang of the drums and the noxious guitar. ""My hands are tied together,"" frontman Russell White screams over and over, and while the repetition gets too barbaric, the tense guitars and humming synth build up and then betray with a short ending. Michelle Maskovich and Russell White formed Champagne Kiss (with Jesse Johnson) after moving to Minneapolis. The duo's new band carries on like a continuation of their time in San Diego's Camera Obscura, a band that left only one document, To Change the Shape of an Envelope, which was rooted in the San Diego hardcore scene, yet branched out towards broader influences. Like fellow Diego-dwellers Clikatat Ikatowi Camera Obscura were willing to experiment, jamming keyboards, samples and piano into the mix. Their songs were more polished than their kin, and they coupled White's shouts with Maskovich's understated backing vocals. A step in the direction of rock seemed likely. If anything, Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves is even more abrasive. I'm staring at the strange retro fashions on the cover-- all neon lines and angular skyscrapers-- and listening to the MIDI beeps and looped crying sounds at the beginning of ""Stereo Relapse."" But then the track busts with a thick seam of guitar buzz and White screams about ""plastic consumption"" and ""reflective addictions."" The Roland keyboard bleeps raw melodies, oddly appropriate for the seething emotions; the electronics are leveled so ear-splittingly in the mix that you barely notice at first that the drums are all programmed. The aesthetic develops into an industrial process, combining remnants of new-wave primitivism with post-punk's linear minimalism, and suddenly I'm feeling Reaganite paranoia all over again. ""Monarch Syndicate"" pummels with endless crashes of percussion as the guitars mass together and uncoil in screw-loose chaos. Hardcore was a uniquely American reaction to punk and cold war suburbia in the 1980s-- defiance channeled through raw sonic force, a sense of community and brotherhood. Champagne Kiss offer up just a hint of that affirmation during the chorus of ""Black Violin"" as they raise their voices and guitars en masse, voices echoing each other awkwardly and shouting, ""This is the last time!"" But then White descends into emo diary drama, squealing about ""bleeding diamonds/ Hands are screaming/ Voice confessions/ That are bleeding."" There's this breathy voiceover (""Can you hear?"") that sounds like Rozz Williams fucking around on a Christian Death b-side. The problem isn't just the loss of any sense of hope; it's that the alternative nihilism doesn't sound as scary as they want it to. ""80's Centric"" is the sound of a band lashing out at all that disgusts it but tripping over itself. ""Don't need another hex on my head!"" White yells, and the battered drums and shrill synth crescendos sound more campy than creepy. According to the liner notes, Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves was recorded in thirty-eight hours. I wish they'd taken more time. Their tech obsolescence and brittle robotic rhythm is in turns menacing and appealing, but this album doesn't contain any one song as amazing as Camera Obscura's ""Cinematheque,"" a surging wave of noise counterpointed by Maskovich's faint couplets. ""Deconstructing Genius"" comes the closest, defining the phrase ""synth stab"" while the guitar tingles edgily and White whispers, ""Panic-stricken with your filled prescriptions."" Screamed lyrics are buried far back, muted and metallic, coming out of some valium-like haze, and after a few minutes of silence another section begins full of hyperspeed snares and lonely piano. The guitars play with knife-edge funk, and the band throws in voice samples about a research paper on the pharmacological properties of Soma. Half an hour is too short to tease with this kind of acidic commentary, but at least the place they're coming from makes sense these days. Remember all the Americans, shocked at terrorist attacks during a time of ""peace?""","""Do you hear that? Now don't turn around-- something's coming up behind you. It's coming closer and ...

I Am Sam OST,Various Artists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e6b1335d7bf1698f29/1:1/w_160/922ca564.jpg,2002-02-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7867-i-am-sam-ost/,V2,"In I Am Sam, Sean Penn plays a retarded man who loves the Beatles. There's only one (other) problem: he's losing custody of his seven-year old daughter, Lucy Diamond Dawson. From what I've heard about the film-- and I haven't seen it, because life's too short-- Penn continually quotes Beatles lyrics and tells anecdotes about the band. So the natural tie-in is a soundtrack album of Beatles songs. Of course, licensing the original songs would have been prohibitively expensive, so in lieu of John, Paul, George and Ringo, this disc features Fab Four covers by seventeen artists and bands, mostly pooled from contemporary pop charts and adult alternative radio. Because these recordings were made for the film, they can't really be faulted for sticking pretty closely to the originals and eschewing any wild interpretations. After all, these bands aren't competing with the Beatles' versions; they're attempting to replicate the songs in a manner which not only suits the film, but also remains accessible to the general public. Not that they're winning any points with us for that, but it does shed some light on why these songs turned out the way they did. While it's true that many great musicians have recorded powerful and creative interpretations of this music, the bulk of Beatles covers have been little more than slavish imitations. And of course, that's what we end up with here. Most of the performers on I Am Sam lean on the Beatles' arrangements and never bring anything unexpected to the table. Sarah McLachlan faithfully runs through ""Blackbird"" on an acoustic guitar; Eddie Vedder echoes the weary tone in Lennon's voice on ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away""; Ben Harper's performance of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" even recreates the song's string section verbatim. Granted, the Vines' ""I'm Only Sleeping"" manages to radiate a little energy, and Ben Folds shows up with a pretty take on ""Golden Slumbers"" with strong vocals and nice orchestration. But elsewhere, things are pretty dismal. The Black Crowes' faithful but dull rendition of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" and the Wallflowers' middling ""I'm Looking Through You"" are both painfully prosaic. Chocolate Genius' reworking of ""Julia"" sounds expensive with its crisp drums, acoustic guitars and rough vocals, but ultimately comes off plastic. And Heather Nova (""We Can Work It Out"") and Sheryl Crow (""Mother Nature's Son"") are just lousy-- they don't even sing well here. Interestingly enough, the one band that actually tried to do something inventive with any of these songs flops miserably. Grandaddy's reworking of ""Revolution"" dumbs the melody down to the band's own standards, with Jason Lytle's colorless, disinterested vocals and extraneous keyboards effects doing little to motivate listeners to the song's namesake. A commendable effort, maybe, but still an ineffective one. And then there are the highlights. Aimee Mann and Michael Penn turn in a fair reading of ""Two of Us,"" with well-crafted production in place of the stripped-down original. Rufus Wainwright's ""Across the Universe"" is unremarkable, but at least brings some conviction and earnestness. Paul Westerberg and Howie Day play acoustic versions of ""Nowhere Man"" and ""Help,"" respectively, and the two songs work well with their back-to-back sequencing. And unexpectedly, Nick Cave actually improves upon Paul McCartney's schmaltzy ""Let It Be"" with his understated, sincere vocals. Regardless, these more passable moments are far outnumbered by the boring and/or intolerable ones. Listeners will probably like (and buy) this soundtrack if they dig the big-name performers. All of these artists have their fans-- even Sheryl Crow-- and if you're one of them, you might enjoy this record. After all, it does exactly what it was meant to do. But with the Beatles, that just doesn't cut it.","In I Am Sam, Sean Penn plays a retarded man who loves the Beatles. There's only one (other) problem ...

Primordia,Deadbeat,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8cfb1335d7bf1699387/1:1/w_160/99544c88.jpeg,2002-02-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2219-primordia/,Intr_Version,"Montreal's abstract electronic community is quite the busy little scene right now. With the Mutek and FCMM festival showcasing the city's laptop and post-techno artists, the city seems to spawns another star every week. And this week, it's Scott Montieth. Congratulations, Scott. Deadbeat is the appropriately ambivalent alias Montieth has adopted for Primordia, his dub-inspired pop-, crack- and fuzz-matic debut for the Intr_Version label. So why should anyone take any notice of Montieth's contribution to a style already bloated beyond sustainability? Simply: Montieth is an accomplished manipulator of sound and a swell storyteller. I approach Primordia in two similar ways: either as a narrative about decay, or as an ice-core drill's journey through millennia-old packed ice. Whether the album is actually about radioactive decay or glaciology, I'm not certain. But these have served as useful metaphors and tools by which I have come understand and appreciate this seven-track collection. I acknowledge that all of this sounds horribly pretentious. But since this music is definitely more oriented for the Whitney than prepared for Rick's Roadhouse Bar, I think that I'm meeting Montieth head-on. Like, if he's being intellectual and artistic enough to describe Brownian motion or the extent of 180 accumulation the glaciers of Greenland, then I should at least attempt to match him. Away from my adopted narrative approaches, Primordia's seven tracks are immensely pixelated versions of Jon Hassell and Brian Eno's Possible Music, with units of distortion and fuzz glide and drift much like Hassell's manipulated trumpet, and the beats here are similar in that they exist out of any time keeping construct. In Possible Music, Nana Vasconcelos and Aiyb Dieng use their ghatam (an earthenware pot percussion instrument featured extensively in South Indian classical music) and congas to comment on and emulate Hassell's and Eno's drifts of sound. Montieth's beats are similarly conversational. But beyond the winking self-effacement of the name Deadbeat, Montieth's moniker serves to state that his beats don't function like the ones on dance records. In this regard, Montieth's beats are indeed dead. Yet, in his Primordia, Montieth's vision of the pristine state of existence, his beats are very much alive and fully functioning-- as much free-floating, uncoalesced entities as his fuzzed-out, drifting synths. While not exactly revolutionary, Primordia does have the rare quality of being as malleable and fascinating as the mind of whoever's listening. And that can go a long way.","Montreal's abstract electronic community is quite the busy little scene right now. With the Mutek and FCMM festival showcasing ...

Selected Ambient Works 85-92,Aphex Twin,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c2ea9e61561daa4636/1:1/w_160/9f2f45b8.jpg,2002-02-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/,DistanceDistance,"Stop me if this gets sappy. And it might. Because Selected Ambient Works 85-92—recently reissued by PIAS America—was the very first electronic music I ever bought, and certainly the first I ever heard over and over again. Long ago, before I was old enough to drive, I would sit in a small, cluttered bedroom in my parents’ suburban ranch house, absorbed for hours by the sounds contained on this disc. The creeping basslines, the constantly mutating drum patterns, the synth tones which moved with all the grace and fluidity of a professional dancer, the strange noises that I’d be unable to identify even if I tried. Back then, Aphex Twin was making music like nothing I’d ever heard before. What’s become apparent since is that I probably wasn’t the only one affected. After last year's disappointing Drukqs, it’s easy to forget that, back in the Warp Records heyday, Richard D. James was to this new breed of ambient and electronic music what Babe Ruth was to baseball. Sure, there were upstarts; µ-Ziq, Squarepusher, and Autechre were all on the scene by the time this collection hit shelves. But James was still the poster boy, the presumed ringmaster, single-handedly defining a style of music in the minds of many. Now, as a new wave of mostly twentysomethings step to the forefront of IDM, redefining electronic music for the third time in a decade, it becomes more and more obvious just how far reaching James’ influence was. There’s nothing new about this re-release, aside from improved availability and decreased cost. But then, improving on this package would be near impossible. Sure, the music on Selected Ambient Works 85-92 may sound a bit dated (as does, to be fair, most electronic music more than a few years old), but there’s no denying it was the defining statement of Warp’s early years, and the foundation for the careers of bands like Boards of Canada and Plaid. The songs here are not ambient in the same way as those on this disc’s sequel. Technically, most fall into Brian Eno’s broad definition of the style—it can be appreciated in small segments just as much as in its entirety. The music develops slowly, unafraid to linger on a particularly effective sound for as long as necessary—the creeping keyboard loop of “Schottkey 7th Path,” for example, is continually modified throughout the course of the song, but never once eliminated from the mix—but James would never be content as a mere follower in anyone’s footsteps. His work here serves a model for what would come to be known as traditional IDM. A simpler version of the style we’ve grown accustomed to, certainly, but IDM nonetheless. James’ early work is heavily indebted to early dance music, filled with beats so eminently danceable as to confuse those who only know him from the spastic drum patterns that came later. There’s little of that here, though. Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is, rather, an album stretching back to the days before software allowed for heavy sampling or glitch technology. Drum machines serve as its backbone and synthesized bass and keyboard sounds provide the meat. Most of the songs follow a relatively basic formula as well. One element—say, a synth melody—is introduced and repeated, and as new elements are added with each go round, the song gradually builds to a dense, multi-layered swirl. This Ravel-esque approach flavors much of James’ older material, and yet, despite the simplicity of his equipment and approach, the songs here are both interesting and varied, ranging from the dancefloor-friendly beats of “Pulsewidth” to the industrial clanks and whirs of “Green Calx.” Indeed, these early works do a fine job of showcasing James’ ability to transform even the most seemingly mundane patterns into something unique and interesting. “Hedphelym,” for instance, is built around a relentless headache-throb cliché of a house beat. But James surrounds the pulsation with an ethereal feedback that bleeds all over the track, leaving the percussion awash in a murky solution of synth tones, pairing dance music with ambience in ways the Orb never dreamed possible. Slightly more structured (and equally enjoyable) is “We are the Music Makers,” a track which follows a drumbeat and a bassline past a pair of intertwined synth loops and a repeated Willy Wonka vocal sample as simple keyboard melodies pour down from overhead. But the aforementioned “Green Calx” is the closest Selected Ambient Works 85-92 comes to the spastic trickery of which James would become such a pioneer. It matches pitchshifted tones and drum machines with a burbling bassline, assorted machine-gun synth interjections, the slightly effected tones of various pistons, motors, and machines, and even the occasional cartoon spring noise. Moments like these serve to foreshadow both James’ later work, as well as the infinitely more complex twists and turns that IDM would make in the years that would follow. They say next to no one heard the Velvet Underground’s first album when it was released, but everyone who did went on to start a band. Listening to Selected Ambient Works 85-92, one can’t help but imagine the seeds being planted in the imaginations of the lucky few who were there when it all began. Nestled in these simple, undeniably danceable tracks are the roots of contemporary IDM. And despite its somewhat primitive origins, the final product remains among the most interesting ever created with a keyboard and a computer.","Stop me if this gets sappy. And it might.

Use with Headphones Late at Night: Best of 1990-2000,Tadpoles,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71aea9e61561daa54f0/1:1/w_160/4a7f9395.jpg,2002-02-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7915-use-with-headphones-late-at-night-best-of-1990-2000/,Bakery,"There are styles of music that I figure will probably always be around in some form, and psychedelia is one of them. I have a lot of reasons for thinking that, but the main one is that, as a genre, it's so adaptable. The advent of decent recording technology was one of the main things that made truly psychedelic music possible in the first place, so it seems natural that the music should continue to evolve with the technology. Secondly, psychedelia is at best a vaguely defined genre distinction, so it's easy to apply it to music that comes decidedly from a rock or pop standpoint, but is colored on the edges with noise and effects. The Tadpoles pretty much exemplify what most American psychedelic music sounded like in the 1990s-- melodic rock wrapped in blankets of fuzz, heavily processed guitars and the occasional electronic studio effect. The Tadpoles were adept enough at jamming and developing themes, but they were at their best when working with concise, punchy songs. Then they broke up in 2000 (""indefinite hiatus,"" they called it), and leader Tom Parker pulled together this retrospective as a eulogy of sorts for the band. By and large, he's come up with a good overview of their catalog, taking four tracks from each of the band's four studio LPs, and one track from 1997's Know Your Ghosts EP. The 78-minute disc starts where it logically should, with four songs from the band's debut album, 1994's He Fell into the Sky, and proceeds chronologically from there. As such, it gives a clear view of just how much the Hoboken, NJ band progressed during their career. ""Snapper"" opens things in a haze of stompbox fuzz, with Parker's tenor voice hanging low in the mix. Original drummer Michael Kite Audino lays on the toms hard, and the sheets of distortion sometimes give way to cleanly strummed guitar chords, and even something that might be described as a solo at one point (albeit not a very melodic one). The vocals stay fairly buried and the guitar tones largely the same for the other three selections from He Fell, the best of which is probably the slow-burning ""The Ride,"" which features some fine playing from bassist David Max and a gloriously muddy buildup near the end. The four selections from 1996's Far Out show progress almost immediately, with Nick Kramer's heavily processed guitar coming to the fore after the departure of co-guitarist Andrew Jackson. ""Race You to the Mustard Patch"" drips in wah pedals and vocal effects, while the Nick Kramer-sung ""Nazareth"" remains squeaky-clean until about 2\xBD minutes in, when it briefly explodes in a ball of distortion and flailing lead lines. ""Ride the World Around the Sun"" features dueling guitars orbiting a solid bassline, while ""At Least I'm Not Like Jonathan Carver"" begins floating somewhere in space before congealing halfway through into a heavy, aggressive attack. The portion of the disc devoted to 1998's excellent Smoke Ghost album is probably the most solid portion of the compilation, as the band finally hit on a combination of songwriting and sound that balanced the two equally. Kramer puts his voice out in front for ""Know Your Ghosts,"" and the band allows for considerably more space in the arrangement, setting up some dramatic guitar breaks. ""Jaded Jean"" could easily have been a single, falling into the same noise-tainted pop territory that the Jesus and Mary Chain nurtured in the 80s. Both Parker and Kramer had come a long way with their singing by this point, which allowed them not only to handle better, rangier melodies, but also gave them the confidence to put them up front in the mix, a move that greatly increases the immediacy of the songs. The only disappointing thing about this section of the disc is that Parker has chosen not to include Smoke Ghost's excellent opener ""When I Feel,"" which is easily one of the band's best songs. Still, the propulsive, effects-drenched ""Firecracker"" is a reasonable substitute, if not an ideal one. ""Judas, This Is Jesus,"" from the Know Your Ghosts EP, follows, breaking the chronological flow for a few moments, but it's unlikely that any listener would mind, as the song doesn't sound like a step back at all. It begins with an answering machine message of a man saying, ""Judas, this is Jesus. It's raining silver. Help me,"" a clip that reverberates over the course of the whole instrumental, which is otherwise a sticky concoction of molten guitar mayhem. Whirlaway, the band's final album (and their only effort not recorded for their own Bakery label) had by far the clearest sound of any of their releases, incorporating more keyboards and electronics and largely eschewing the fuzz that typified their early work. Instead, the distortion on ""Crash of the Bug"" is more controlled and less opaque. The guitars take on more melodic tasks, too, soaring in tandem behind the verses and bridging the gaps between vocal passages. Final drummer Adam Boyette lays down a furious groove on that album's title song, giving Max the chance to toss off an impressive bass lead at one point and ably supporting the fluid guitar leads. Unfortunately, the last two tracks each find the band gazing a little too hard at their shoes, ending the disc on a fairly unengaging note, but overall, Use with Headphones Late at Night is a satisfying look at the Tadpoles' studio career. Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about it is that it only focuses on their studio material, neglecting to include a single track from The Tadpoles Destroy Terrastock, an EP documenting their ferocious performance at the original Ptolemaic Terrascope-sponsored Terrastock festival in 1997. As far as definitive statements on what the band was capable of at their best, that EP just may be it. Aside from that, though, there's little to gripe about. This is, in the end, a faithful overview that serves as a fine introduction to one of the great overlooked psychedelic acts of the 90s. Of course, it also catches them wandering here and there, but by and large, Use With Headphones Late at Night concentrates on the band's most focused work. For most people, this is all the Tadpoles you'll ever need. You may still want to try and catch them destroying Terrastock, though.","There are styles of music that I figure will probably always be around in some\n\ form, and psychedelia is ...

A School of Secret Dangers,Amy Annelle,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a55e6ef9596931ffd4/1:1/w_160/69c75e3a.jpg,2002-02-18 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/197-a-school-of-secret-dangers/,Hush,"The title of Amy Annelle's latest solo album, A School of Secret Dangers, quotes John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley. Steinbeck wrote the book after taking a trip across the country, and Annelle's album has a similar feel: collecting eleven songs from four years' worth of home recordings, it takes snapshots of American scenes. With their spare tunes and elliptical lyrics, Annelle's songs are like pinpricks on a vast map. Amy Annelle has never sung a word she didn't need. On her solo albums and in her work with the Places, she has a perfect sense of how to use silence in her recordings-- neither playing faster to fill the quiet, nor slowing down to create it. She recorded A School of Secret Dangers alone, singing and accompanying herself on guitar. Her vocals are the selling point for the album: Annelle has a compelling voice that can sound both breathy and grounded, dreamy and rough-- like having the bartender sing you a lullaby. And the album sounds great, considering Annelle recorded it to lo-fi four-track. The ambience is intimate but wide-open, as if she were camping out in her backyard. Silence hangs behind every song, and it's a breathing presence on the quieter numbers-- for example, around the low vocals on ""Ugly Stray."" The only context comes from the ""found sound"" between some of the tracks. Annelle also includes recordings of distorted music and talk programs from Christian radio broadcasts. Cribbing from backwater religious radio may not be original, but the dislocated voices are eerily effective. Compared to the indie pop of her last album, the Places' excellent debut The Autopilot Knows You Best, these songs have simpler tunes and stick closer to country and folk. ""The Birds Start Talking English,"" the upbeat opener, lopes along as Annelle sings about a campfire on a hillside; other songs are more dour, such as ""Broke Down,"" about an abandoned cemetery. The gently catchy melody of ""Soft City"" carries a description of a city at night, along with vague information about the person who's looking at it. Annelle challenges herself to make these lyrics ambiguous but not meaningless. She generally succeeds, but the more detailed songs have better lines-- check these ones from ""Idaho"": ""We stay up all night listening to your grandpa's 78s/ Til the lights begin to glow and shadow all the lines on your face."" A School of Secret Dangers requires more attention than the immediately likeable Autopilot, but its songs get better with every listen. Their subtlety, when matched with the restraint of Annelle's performance, allow her to explore ideas that she can't approach directly. Annelle implies the emptiness around the places she sings about, and the movement of people through wide open spaces, listening to half-received radio broadcasts. And in doing so, she captures the sound of being alone.","The title of Amy Annelle's latest solo album, A School of Secret Dangers, quotes John Steinbeck's Travels with ...

Deceit,This Heat,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a782ea9e61561daa55dc/1:1/w_160/4111c40e.jpg,2002-02-18 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8015-deceit/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"This Heat were many things, but popular was never one of them. It's almost funny to see this record getting so much deserved attention recently due to its reissue, because before now, I only knew a few people who had even heard of the thing. It's especially strange to see all the praise in light of Gareth Williams' death on Christmas Eve last year. He wasn't a person who ever really wanted to be famous or even known as a musician, and yet will doubtlessly be better known henceforth than he'd ever been during This Heat's existence. English drummer/vocalist Charles Hayward (fresh from working with Brian Eno and Phil Manzanera in the avant-prog/fusion outfit Quiet Sun) formed This Heat with Charles Bullen (guitar, clarinet, viola, etc.) and Williams (bass, keyboards, tape manipulation, etc.) around 1975. Hayward had worked with a fairly broad array of jazz and prog bands (and post-This Heat, would continue to do so), though Bullen and Williams were much less traveled, even as they were accomplished musicians. Hayward and Bullen had been playing together as a duo for a few years prior to This Heat, and began playing with Williams only after Hayward completed his duties with Quiet Sun. Williams would actually leave the band before this album, Deceit, was released, and maintain a very busy career as an engineer for John Barry and various symphonic recordings. His interest in recording techniques may have provided the impetus for This Heat to experiment with tape loops and editing, which would play very large roles in their studio output. This Heat's sound was something like a confrontation of prog, free-jazz and contemporary electronic music (think early Stockhausen, not Kraftwerk). They often get lumped into the post-punk (or even just ""punk"") camp, for no better reason other than they started at the same time. They certainly sounded as if they were angry about something, and taking a glance at the lyric sheet for this album (and you'd better, as often the vocals seem more musical element than communicative force), they had fairly intense political/social statements to make-- though pinning down their position is often as hard as pinning down their sound. In any case, they were ""progressive"" in the literal sense of the word, and though they came up with the first wave of punk, they didn't really sound like anyone else of the time (save a few other English radicals like Henry Cow or Art Bears, occasionally). Deceit was the band's second and final album (not counting posthumous releases, including the excellent BBC session release Made Available). As odd as it sounds on the surface, it's actually the more immediately appealing of their two albums, at least partially because of a greater emphasis on drive and something like song structure (though the music here is quite a ways from typical ""songs""). The vocals-- mostly handled by Hayward-- were probably the weakest link for This Heat, though they don't really take away from the music so much as push it into yet a stranger realm. ""Sleep,"" the first track, is actually an atypically calm song, almost like a fractured lullaby. Layers of what sound like African percussion, and a simple piano line support a very low-key melody, wherein lines like, ""Softness is a thing called comfort/ Doesn't cost much to keep in touch/ We never forget you have a choice,"" make me wonder if there isn't some kind of subversive commentary about consumer ethics and advertising at work. This shortly leads to the rave-up ""Paper Hats"" with its brawny, pouncing rhythms and subtly acrobatic guitar lines. This is a piece with several sections, none of them having too much to do with each other. Some, like the lengthy outro, sound like archetypical math-rock, with repetitive, complicated rhythmic patterns, while the brief middle section is more viscerally dynamic, or perhaps even ""noisy."" Lyrically, the band was as eclectic: ""Well, what do we expect?/ Paper hats?/ Or maybe even roses?/ The sound of explosions?/ Oh no."" I'd like to know what they expected, but I'm not sure what they got instead, and am certainly in the dark about to whom they protested. ""Triumph"" is a Dadaist collage of various noises, musical and otherwise. There's a brief accordion intro, leading to what sounds like a kazoo lament accompanied by someone scraping a few pieces of metal and wood together. Then, Hayward mentions something about the angles being reversed, and the garbage symphony makes its grand conclusion-- all in less than three minutes. Perhaps this was a prologue for ""S.P.Q.R.,"" which throws out any ideas of abstract noodling in favor of pure rock expression. The high-speed beat threatens to overpower a droning duo vocal line (""We organize via property as power/ Slavehood and freedom imperial purple/ Pax Romana!""). This track doesn't run through a myriad of stylistic changes; it makes its case via sheer persistence. Hayward's interest in all manner of world rhythms and percussion manifested itself in tracks like ""Shrink Wrap"" and ""Independence"" (words provided by one Thomas Jefferson), where kinetic drum orchestras and ancient rain forest flutes and strings lent the music an otherworldly quality which further removed it from recordings by This Heat's angry peers. ""Radio Prague"" features more electronic trickery, and what sounds like someone actually tuning in and out of a Czech radio broadcast. There's a steady pitter-patter underneath, and some rather dark drones in the background (along with a haunting cello), and though I'm tempted to say this could have influenced Godspeed You Black Emperor!, it's more likely an isolated vignette. In a way, the entire album seems removed from typical musical happenings-- even the underground. Maybe that's why it's taken so long for This Heat to start receiving their due. The band got its digs in once more for ""A New Kind of Water,"" expressing the rage that seems to have been implied throughout the record, though rarely shown directly. Phrases like, ""We were told to expect more/ And now that we've got more/ We want more, we want more,"" offer some of the only clear ideas about the feelings behind Deceit, and the music is appropriately insistent (crashing drums, wailing group vocals, very precise, discordant guitar lines). Over the years, there have been bands to play as aggressively, or even as strangely, but very few have been able to rise from their collective influences and histories to create music so singularly distinctive and inspiring. I don't know that Hayward, Bullen and Williams were trying to inspire (and that they debated over whether to release their music at all could be evidence to support that they weren't), but the overall feeling I take away from this album is that of revolution and a very creative form of protest. That's what I call punk.","This Heat were many things, but popular was never one of them. It's almost funny to see this record ...

Forever,Cracker,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a693b1335d7bf1698e6a/1:1/w_160/4c7611bf.jpg,2002-02-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1651-forever/,VirginBack Porch,"Get ready, key Pitchfork demographic (18-25 year olds); you're about to become the target of an oldies campaign. Given the ever-shortening waiting period for nostalgia (hey, man, remember when the Patriots won the Super Bowl?) it's just a matter of time before the first ""hits of the 90s"" radio stations start popping up across the country. And when ""Seether"" starts rockin' the airwaves again, you better believe Verula Salt will be touring America's low-capacity venues, perhaps co-headlining with Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Jesus Jones. Nine years removed from their biggest hits, Cracker would seem to be state-fair circuit material themselves. Yet, to their credit, David Lowery & Co appear to be trying their hardest to avoid this fate and remain a vital, relevant act with their newest album, Forever. Of course, when your band's lasting image for most people is the lead singer boxing Sandra Bernhard, that's an uphill battle to be fighting. Cracker's secret weapon against obscurity, apparently, is to take refuge under the roots-rock banner, releasing Forever on the Virgin imprint Back Porch Records and wearing a whole lot of denim in the album art. While perhaps a further insult to hardcore Camper Van Beethoven fans desperately praying for Lowery to turn around his musical de-evolution, the choice at least reflects a purpose more thought out than, ""Hey, remember us? Please, please, please buy our new album!"" But roots-rock itself has always been something of a questionable cause, usually implying something along the lines of ""we're tired of experimenting; let's just make music that's already been made a thousand times before."" Save a few exceptions, that's mostly the vibe Forever projects, with the band (whittled down to a core of Lowery and guitarist Johnny Hickman) content to reside along a familiar country-rock-soul axis. You've got your acoustic guitar base, your occasional slide guitar fill, your Dylan-esque organ, your chug-a-lug drums, and your mildly catchy melodies. It would be offensive if it wasn't so obvious that Cracker doesn't aspire to much more than this rustic middle-America mediocrity act. Or do they? Mark Linkous returns the favor of Lowery co-writing the brilliant Sparklehorse anthem ""Sick of Goodbyes"" by producing the leadoff ""Brides of Neptune"" and tweaking Cracker's sound by throwing some eerie synth voices and a tinny drum loop into the mix. And while it's not quite Jim O'Rourke re-inventing Wilco, it is a compelling opening to the album. Hickman's lone solo composition, ""Superfan"", also augments the Cracker formula with an underlying drone and some ""Baba O'Riley"" violin, indicating that he's more than just Lowery's hired-gun soloist. But then again, experimentation also gives us ""What You're Missing"", a self-referential joke that painfully allows these Crackers to near-rap about their respective roles in the band. That sound you hear is Biggie rapidly spinning around in his oversized, solid-gold coffin. Humorous intention or no, can we please put a ban on white rock bands rapping? Elsewhere, Lowery's singing voice retains the same old one-dimensional, inflexible rasp which, given the uniformity of the music, works more often than not. Less successful are attempts to soften it with two-bit Sheryl Crow-ish harmony/backing vocals, which give ""Shine"" and ""Guarded by Monkeys"" a distastefully slick sheen. In fact, the album's overall polished countenance doesn't seem to jive with the band's supposed rootsy goals. So, no, Forever isn't the album that's going to rescue Cracker from the discount used bins and return them to radio prominence, but at the very least, it establishes them on the respectable side of the soon-to-be-oldies continuum: more our generation's Cheap Trick than our Doobie Brothers. And something tells me that's about all they're shooting for.","Get ready, key Pitchfork demographic (18-25 year olds); you're about to become the target of an oldies campaign. Given ...

Fog,Fog,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde25e6ef95969323163/1:1/w_160/f903ccf7.jpg,2002-02-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3129-fog/,Ninja Tune,"When it came to music, poor little Timmy could never do anything right. They gave him a horn; he blew in the wrong end. They gave him a guitar; he made feedback. They sat him at a piano; he opened it up and plucked at the chords. So discouraged was little Timmy by the taunts of his peers that one day, he gave up playing music altogether. Then, one sunny afternoon, he stumbled upon a record by this guy named Fog. Fog didn't necessarily play his instruments right, either. Sure, Timmy had heard people scratching records, but he'd never heard anyone doing it like this. It was strange, almost haphazard in a way. The music fell somewhere in between Christian Marclay and Kid Koala-- more a collage of strange sounds sometimes set to guitar or bass than the rhythm-happy scratchfests that comprise most traditional DJ records. Fog seemed more interested in seeing how many strange sounds he could make with his turntables than in keeping a rhythm or showboating. And yet, there was something to the chaos that sounded totally planned, completely sculpted. Timmy was amazed to hear someone show the same utter disregard for convention his very classmates had convinced him was so wrong. Fog became a catalyst for Timmy. He soon realized that there was no such thing as ""a right way"" to play an instrument, and that there were others out there who believed this, too. Soon he would discover other turntable wizards-- folks like Christian Marclay and Otomo Yoshihide-- and he grew even more awestruck. A year later, little Timmy, slightly less little and much less melancholy, found himself surrounded by strange albums, and had even taken up the turntable himself. True, Fog wasn't quite so amazing now that he'd heard all these other turntablists, but it still had its moments and he certainly couldn't deny that it played the role of catalyst in his life, or that it was-- in many ways-- responsible for his trajectory. But enough about Timmy; let's talk about Fog (aka Andrew Broder), a young Minnesotan who grew up, in fact, only a few miles away from Pitchfork's esteemed editor. But while Schreiber was learning to pitch the fork, Broder was no doubt hiding away in a nearby suburban bedroom, destroying records, fooling around with turntables in the dark, and following the call of his muse, no matter how strange that call might have been. As an avant-gardist, Broder's music is solid-- nothing revolutionary, perhaps, but solid. Where Broder truly shines is in his understanding of pop, and in the way he makes it fit so snugly with his more left-field musings. Take the decidedly poppy ""Pneumonia,"" for example. The track starts out sounding like another in a long line of Neutral Milk Hotel imposters, with distorted fuzz bass, a simple acoustic guitar melody, vocals that teeter dangerously on the edge that separates grating from sensitive, and weird ghostly theremin-like noises hovering ominously in the background. But rest assured, it's only Broder and his turntable. He's also keeping the beat with a looped, gently scratched drum sample. But it's when the song reaches its instrumental interlude that Broder really shines, busting out a stunning turntable solo that sounds more like a harmonica or a guitar than a record player. The technique he's using at this point is actually rather minimal-- using records with just one flat tone, allowing it to play on its own more often than he manipulates it. Even then, it's just a quick scratch here and there, and a pitch adjust before he allows it to play again. Still, simple is not synonymous with ineffective or unoriginal. The sound works. Indeed, it's Broder's willingness to give in to his pop sensibilities that make Fog work so well. ""Truth and Laughing Gas"" opens as one of the more straightforward tracks on the album, with thrashing guitar, distorted bass, ominous synths and frenzied hip-hop scratching. But as the song progresses, the guitar falls away and the scratching grows more and more abstract, eventually giving way to an exercise in ambience. ""Hitting a Wall"" begins like Ween or vintage Beck, replete with heavily treated wobbly vocals, purposely sloppy guitar and well-placed scratches. But every so often, Broder's turntable takes over, as if possessed, letting the song fall by the wayside as he presents a barrage of strange noises. Ultimately, Broder allows bits and pieces of crackly old folk records to fall into the collage, and manipulates and contrasts them with feedback-laden guitar that brings us back to the song's opening. Broder restrains himself on ""Glory,"" layering violins and little bells underneath his manipulated percussion samples as cLOUDDEAD's Dose One weaves vocal digressions in and out, nothing more than another element of the atmosphere. If the poppy aspects of some of Fog's songs end up alienating some stuck-up, by-the-book avant-gardists, then so be it. Because it's Broder's careful balancing act between the traditional and the abnormal that makes his music so interesting. And if anything, the album's more traditional moments will serve as a jump-on point for those who'd never think to check out something like ""experimental turntablism."" It's here that Broder will succeed where many of his brethren fail-- not only is he creating innovative music; he's making an effort to expand its audience as well.","When it came to music, poor little Timmy could never do anything right.

In the Beginning There Was Rhythm,Various Artists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e5b1335d7bf169915e/1:1/w_160/6bc8b34b.jpg,2002-02-14 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1991-in-the-beginning-there-was-rhythm/,Soul Jazz,"How raw do you like your dance music? Does modern techno feel like a soft blow to your skull? There used to be a better way. London's Soul Jazz Records has released In the Beginning There Was Rhythm, a compilation of British post-punk bands, including the Slits, Gang of Four, Throbbing Gristle, and Cabaret Voltaire. We're talking about drums and wires, knife-sharp scratchy rhythm guitar, crappy synths, and veteran funk and reggae horns. We're talking men shouting political slogans and naked women covered in mud. And while this music sounds old, it sure as hell isn't dated-- this stuff is primal, made by people who were finding new ways to channel the brute instinct that first drove man to bang animal skins with sticks. These songs came out of the bleak setting of industrial England in the late 70s and early 80s. The Thatcher administration came into power, and skinheads and members of the National Right roamed the streets. Against this climate, bands emerged from the inner city melting pots embodying a new racial, sexual, and musical diversity. DJs spun reggae records at punk shows. Tape loops and synthesizers joined the guitar as lead instruments. Funk, dub, and experimental music were bigger influences than the Velvet Underground or ""Iggy Fucking Pop"" (to quote A Certain Ratio's Simon Topping), and all-girl and multiracial bands introduced new ideas to the ""white boys, three chords and an attitude"" world of pop. Every track on this album cooks with the excitement of musicians trying new things. For their ""Coup"" single, 23 Skidoo were joined by a star funk bassist and horn section. Then, once they had an unstoppable dance track, they piled on sound effects of breaking glass and guns firing-- just because it sounds cool. At the brainier end of the scale, the shamefully obscure This Heat manufactured ""24 Track Loop"" with just a tape loop and a mixing board, huddling in the studio that they'd made from a converted meat locker. They crib from dub and the avant-garde, but more important, ""24 Track Loop"" is a sick little number with a fast beat and a terrifically abrasive sound that comes off absolutely modern. There are also straight-up guitar bands, which combined left-wing politics with ass-shaking rhythm sections. The Pop Group's ""She Is Beyond Good and Evil""-- one of their most infectious singles-- appears here, with its bone marrow guitars and Mark Stewart's guttural swagger, ""Western values mean nothing to her."" Reggae veteran Dennis Bovell, who also produced albums for the Slits, adds effects that make it sound monstrously vast. Gang of Four, who played legendary tours in the States, tear through ""To Hell With Poverty,"" singing, ""Some are insane and they're in charge,"" over heavy drums and jagged, searing guitars. This single alone makes everything Rage Against the Machine has ever aspired to redundant. Less aggressive and more off-kilter, the Slits contribute the title song, ""In the Beginning There Was Rhythm."" Ari Up's untrained voice mutters, needles and bellows the lyrics; a little warbly and massively expressive, she's in top form on this track. You could almost call this compilation ""eclectic,"" but that's too quaint a word for music that punches you in the gut. The bands are diverse but every song has a killer beat that sells the political lyrics and grounds the experimentation. Whatever the methods and whoever's in the line-up, every band here understands that fundamental, deep-as-your-soul rhythm: like Ari Up sings, ""God says you will dance."" If there's anything's wrong with the disc, it's that it's too short; the story of post-punk could take up several box sets. The disc comes with 35 pages of liner notes, but the record itself doesn't tell a story or connect the songs. Many bands got left out, and it would also be interesting to hear how the bands developed-- for example, to watch the early Human League with its craptronic keyboards and all-guy line-up grow into the band that created the synth-pop masterpiece Dare. But the problem with big anthologies is that they inevitably use tracks that are important but aren't fun. In the Beginning, on the other hand, doesn't have a single limp tune. It'll amaze new listeners and give old ones some hard-to-find tracks. Buy it.","How raw do you like your dance music? Does modern techno feel like a soft blow to your skull? There ...

The Beginning Stages of...,The Polyphonic Spree,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0de5e6ef9596932005e/1:1/w_160/69cf930f.jpg,2002-02-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6394-the-beginning-stages-of/,Good,"It takes a lot of work to grow up in Austin, Texas and manage to go through life with a live-music deficiency, but around late '98, I was one of the few diagnosed with this ailment. Although the condition is severe, it can be easily remedied within a good 14-16 months (or one Les Savy Fav show, whichever comes first). As the treatment-- which consists, unsurprisingly, of going to shows-- progressed, I began donning a host of new traits and characteristics, all symptomatic of my burgeoning addiction to the spectacle of live performance, an insatiable mistress that will leave you penniless and in the gutter if not carefully restrained (or so I'm told). Restraint, however, is something I've yet to exhibit. You see, when the Polyphonic Spree came through town opening for headlining heavyweights Built to Spill, my pocketbook told me not to go. Actually, my pocketbook and an invoice from Wells Fargo were both fighting to dissuade me from blowing my last $15 on such an obvious one-night stand. But anyone will tell you that the call of Doug Martsch is not to be ignored, even if he is touring in support of a mediocre album. So with high spirits and a slightly altered dieting plan for the proceeding month, I bought the ticket and took the ride. Having had no formal experience with the Polyphonic Spree, I ignorantly deduced from the name that I was in for about an hour of freely traded rhymes about pop culture and sneakers, the way the Sugarhill Gang used to drop it, while 25 figures clad in nothing but unkempt white robes and Cheshire-cat smiles slowly lumbered onto the stage. As my eyes discerned the familiar form of ex-Tripping Daisy frontman Tim DeLaughter, my first inclination was to scale the four-foot protective barricade that acted as the group's metallic moat and shake him vigorously in an effort to deprogram the fallen Texas auteur. But as I stood there, waiting for a vat of Kool-Aid-flavored cyanide to make its appearance and confirm my deepest, darkest fears, I began to notice the song that was stirring to life on stage. What ensued was a revivalist get-down that would put any Episcopalian minister to shame. DeLaughter's warbling vocals, unwavering heavenward gaze, and beaming smile seemed to speak for the entire group (which consists of two percussionists, a choir, and a theremin player, amongst others). In fact, the evening could have easily found the Polyphonic Spree upstaging any number of lesser headliners, were they not Built to Spill. So then why does this, the Spree's first album, released on DeLaughter's own Good Records label, seem so... unimaginative? As it stands, the Polyphonic Spree are the musical approximation of saccharin, in that they make a great substitute for pure, unadulterated twee. But, also like saccharin, they are possibly cancerous in heavy doses. The more anthemic crowd-pleasing numbers littered throughout The Beginning Stages of the Polyphonic Spree boast such endlessly repeated refrains as ""Hey/ It's the Sun/ And it makes me Shine,"" which lose a lot of their appeal when taken out of their natural habitat (the live setting) and placed between your headphones. In the end, the experience becomes less like our generation's ""Takin' Care of Business"" and more like those fireside sing-alongs you were coerced into participating in at summer camp. The album, comprised of 10 ""sections,"" chronicles a group whose only precedents are the familiar melodies of lazy 1970s AM radio and inspirational religious cable TV programming. Luckily, though, the group has an unrealized experimental side which can be attributed with some of the album's most exciting moments and one the disc's best songs (""Section 4""). But for every risk taken, there's a counterproductive indulgence. A good example of this is ""Section 3,"" which begins as a stunning meditation on guitar and viola before suddenly being overwhelmed by pan flutes and self-parodying chimes. I mean it when I say that it's the best ballad John Stamos has done since he covered the Beach Boys' ""Forever."" The Beginning Stages, sadly, never approaches anything greater than novelty. Given the fact that the Polyphonic Spree are a self-proclaimed ""choral symphonic pop band,"" most songs come off like mid-70s Todd Rundgren (ouch!) with multi-tracked vocal harmonies. The premise for the group is admittedly genius, but if DeLaughter's goal is to distill their stage presence and the giddiness conjured at Spree performances onto compact disc, he and his Polyphonic friends will have to find a way to work around their music's seemingly necessary visual accompaniment.","It takes a lot of work to grow up in Austin, Texas and manage to go through life with a ...

Vernacular Homocide EP,Mike Ladd,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc63eb335119a49ecc5d/1:1/w_160/631d3a97.gif,2002-02-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4622-vernacular-homocide-ep/,Ozone,"The phrase ""intelligent hip-hop"" gets thrown around a lot, much like ""intelligent dance music,"" and both bother me somewhat. They seem to imply that hip-hop and dance music are naturally unintelligent styles, and a special provision has to be made to distinguish the select few exceptions that break the mold of stupidity. And that's not even getting into the vaguely racist connotations the phrase brings with it: you don't hear people talking about ""intelligent indie rock"" as a genre separate from plain ol' indie rock. I just wanted to wipe the slate clean before applying the phrase to Mike Ladd, possibly the brainiest of the latest wave of Ivy League rap. There's a widely circulating story that Ladd went to Harvard. He didn't-- he was just born in Cambridge, Massachusetts-- but it's revealing that the story is so widely accepted. as gospel. He sounds like he went there. Not that Ladd's rhymes possess some kind of mindtwisting complexity, but everything he has his hand in radiates thoughtfulness and craft. Ladd discovered hip-hop, punk, and poetry at roughly the same time as a kid, so he's equally comfortable discussing, or rapping about, Parliament, J. Mascis and Langston Hughes. He began his career as a spoken word artist in New York, and his words still push the envelope conceptually, but somewhere along the line, he learned how to create amazingly textured and funky musical backdrops to accompany his words. And actually, they're more than just backdrops on Vernacular Homocide. On this seven-song EP, containing half previously released b-sides and half new tracks, Ladd's instrumental sketches threaten to upstage his verbal throwdowns. ""Poseidon's Reigns,"" for instance, has Ladd welding a ragged-ass drum machine to soaring, Fripp-like guitar sear like something from Bowie's Berlin trilogy. Then there's ""Music for Tanks,"" sounding like the soundtrack to a Tarkovsky sci-fi flick set in the Caribbean. Both songs are clear highlights you take with you long after the words have faded from memory. Of the tracks which offer a taste of Ladd's lyrical skills, the best of the batch is the opening track, ""Foxwoods,"" a smoothly flowing antidote to the ""no-flow-fo'-hoes"" brand of hip-hop. ""Payback's a bitch,"" Ladd sings, ""even in small increments."" Elsewhere, ""The Last Word"" is a spaced-out soul shout-out where Ladd raves (seemingly sarcastically), ""Nobody makes money like Mike Ladd makes money,"" with operatic backup singers spurring him on. ""Northampton"" is a Mad Lib-style, sped-up rant that sounds like a five-year-old singing James Brown, and it sits in sharp contrast to the final track: a sober, unaccompanied poem about Ladd's mother, or more specifically, about her age. ""If I tell my mother's age, I'll never be forgiven,"" Ladd speaks slowly and deliberately. ""St. Peter will look at me with those horrible, cascading eyes like a woman from the ice storm."" Vernacular Homocide is a quick and powerful dose of what makes Mike Ladd someone to keep an eye one: great lyrics that never try to be witty (they simply are) and rarely reveal themselves immediately, and an amazing stylistic breadth, from semi-comedic rap to what you could call singer/songwriter hip-hop. His two full-lengths are also great, but can be a bit overwhelming. This disc might be a better place for the uninitiated to sample Ladd's lyrical prowess and sound manipulation wizardry.","The phrase ""intelligent hip-hop"" gets thrown around a lot, much like ""intelligent dance music,"" and both bother me somewhat.

Cold Cold Water EP,Mirah,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35269fc7814a47cd601/1:1/w_160/729a6fe5.jpg,2002-02-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5328-cold-cold-water-ep/,K,"With all the love we here at Pitchfork have showered on the Microphones lately, we thought it high time to let Mirah in on some action, too. You see, besides appearing on just about every Microphones release so far, Mirah (full name Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn) released an excellent collection of songs in 2000 called You Think It's Like This but Really It's Like This, which was produced by lead Microphone Phil Elvrum. And she's issued enough singles and comp tracks over the past couple of years to choke all of Calvin Johnson's kittens. Now, gearing up for her sophomore full-length, Mirah drops a nice little EP on us called Cold Cold Water. When I first heard the title, the sick part of me was hoping for a cover version of the old country standard popularized by classic cowboy balladeer Marty Robbins. Such was not the case, but the title track does evoke Robbins in a strange way. It's a bombastic gunfighter ballad (of sorts), coming off not entirely unlike Björk on peyote having visions of the Old West. And you'd think it was all completely tongue-in-cheek judging from the cover art, which depicts Mirah as a masked outlaw, ready to fire her handgun at who knows what evil, off-cover menace. Yet, taken on its own, the song is deadly serious, dark, and full of the kind of not-so vague sexual innuendos we've come to expect from Mirah. It starts with the lines, ""I saddled up my pony right and rode into the ghostly night/ It was wide, wide open,"" accompanied by a simple guitar strum. Then, Phil Elvrum's panoramic, Morricone-esque production technique explodes onto the soundstage with swelling strings, huge crashing cymbals, mammoth tympani, and strikingly effective hoof-clopping sounds. Meanwhile, Mirah sings about (as far as I can tell) finding a lover and taking him away to ""where the water's deep"" to ""make the air you breath so sweet."" It gets kinda vague from there, but it's the discrepancy between Mirah's voice, which is intimacy incarnate, and the sweeping grandeur of the production and backing music that makes the song truly affecting. The dynamic creates a complex but beautiful irony that's intoxicating. After the title track, there are three songs of admirable bedroom folk, played solo and recorded by Calvin Johnson (including a unadorned version of ""Cold Cold Water""). Then, there's eight tracks of ""excerpts"": snippets from the Elvrum-enhanced title track singled out. First, the string section is heard all by itself, then guitar and background vocals, then drums and percussion, and so on. And it's amazing how a close listen to these snippets alter how you listen to ""Cold Cold Water""; you hear all these little parts you missed the first time around. It turns the EP into more of a participatory experience, and it's an interesting way to fill up an EP without resorting to b-material, keeping focus on the main song and enhancing the experience of listening to it. I'm not giving Elvrum all the credit here-- the songs are what hold the EP together-- but this kid is a genius when it comes to recorded sound. And judging from the sound of the EP's title track, he's put a lot more time and effort into the recording process of Mirah's forthcoming album, Advisory Committee, than he did for You Think It's Like This. With any luck, it will be Mirah's first exceptional release.","With all the love we here at Pitchfork have showered on the Microphones lately, we\n\ thought it high time ...

Night Owls 01,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77b5e6ef95969320fb9/1:1/w_160/93ccfec4.jpg,2002-02-13 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1875-night-owls-01/,Deluxe,"Night Owls 01 is the best kind of label compilation: one with an overriding theme. Rather than slapping together a bunch of cast-offs haphazardly, Deluxe's Mike Martinez commissioned tracks-- some by Deluxe artists, some not-- that relate in some way to the nocturnal. In addition to reflecting the nighttime premise, most of the artists here approach electronic music from the glitch/click/cut angle, lending further textural continuity to the compilation. That said, one man's continuity is another's redundancy, and there's no doubting that if you're growing tired of glitches, you will not enjoy Night Owls 01. This sort of sound is everywhere in electronic music these days, and a few of these tracks seem nothing more than indistinct IDM with a few fashionable signifiers. To ignore the compilation as a whole because of a handful of dull tracks would be a mistake, though, because there's some exceptional work happening here. And despite the similarities in approach and sound, it's not hard to tell where the real talent lies on Night Owls 01. For starters, you have to look to label boss Mike Martinez. He contributes two tracks: one in collaboration with visual artists and designer Jon Santos (whom he works with as Parts:places), the other under his familiar Electric Birds guise. The Parts:places track, ""Untitled No. 8,"" is a standout, a brilliant sheen of subaquatic drone and throbbing feedback sprinkled gently with evocative clicks and glitches. It actually sounds more like Electric Birds than the Electric Birds track ""Autofibre,"" in which assorted bell-like tones are processed and split apart before the tune develops into a quivering mediation on two organ chords, complete with relaxed drum programming. Also skilled is Finnish newcomer Esa Ruoho, whose two exceptional tracks mark him as a producer to watch. The bass bubbles of ""Molies 1"" feel dark and cold, with a high-end roll-off conjuring the arctic breeze Alec Empire cultivated on his Low on Ice release. More impressive still is ""Molies 2,"" which feels like midnight in the oil-soaked field behind the abandoned screw machine shop. The sounds of strange chattering creatures are mixed with a hum that seems sampled from a slowly creaking weathervane, helping make the track genuinely scary. Deluxe artist Eblake contributes the similar and equally strong ""Nachtmusik,"" a track that would have been the best cut his debut record. Clanking metal, vague splashing sounds and deep organ chords give the piece the feel of a three a.m. film noir scene. The final highlight is by little-known French producer Aspic, a feast of Microstoria-style botched transmissions, the sound of an amplified tap on a massive phone network fed through a delay machine. The above is the good stuff, and the remainder of Night Owls 01 is not so much bad as indistinct. The tracks in between the standouts do little to draw attention to themselves, and instead seem to serve as lengthy bridges between the peaks. Overall, Night Owls 01 makes for a good front-to-back listen and effective background music. Just be sure to pull yourself from your book at the first sound of something exceptional.","Night Owls 01 is the best kind of label compilation: one with an overriding theme.

Princess Superstar Is,Princess Superstar,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1385e6ef95969320134/1:1/w_160/c0ffd3fe.jpg,2002-02-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6483-princess-superstar-is/,Rapster!K7,"Princess Superstar is not, as many junket-jittery journalists would have you believe, the female Marshall Mathers. Her tongue is far more whiplash, and in terms of panache, she got Detroit's trailer park provocateur beaten by a mile. Plus, she's the mistress of her own destiny (not another Dre pawn); her previous releases came out bearing the manufacturing stamps of her own stridently anti-corporate A Big Rich Major Label and Corrupt Conglomerate outfits. Princess Superstar Is is the follow-up to 2000's Last of the Great Twentieth-Century Composers, and her transition from self-releasing material to signing with !K7's hip-hop offshoot Rapster will ensure her broader distribution. Which means that all of us who aren't prowling Manhattan's East Village for white labels will have the pleasure of the Princess' company. This album is, as you'd expect from such a title, is collection of beat-down statements about who Princess Superstar is. She's as rapidly keen to distance herself from the idea that she's some producer's dolly as she would be to distance herself from someone with scabies. So ""Who Writes Your Lyrics"" is an assault weapon rhyme: ""Son of Sam? I'm the daughter of Sam/ Slaughter a man on the microphone/ Pardon me, ma'am, was that part of a man or your son I just whipped on the mic and sent home?"" Princess reinforces those homicidal statements with more operational ones: ""So I'm a girl, yeah, I'm white and I write all night with a bare swingin' light/ On the computer, alright? A producer, alright? I produced this song/ So you know who you are, you know you were wrong/ No, I was not in that porn On Golden Blonde/ Got it goin' on, more James Bond than Sean John."" Not only is Princess Superstar all about eliminating any mis/preconceptions about her being a white chick in hip-hop, but she's also gagging to emasculate the style, too. In ""Keith 'N' Me,"" her duet with the Spankmaster himself, Superstar leaves Kool Keith panting and blue-balled. In a star-struck moment, she mutters, ""I gotta call my moms, tell her Keith's on my song/ Ultramagnetic you helped my headache like a music paramedic/ You mad athletic, there I said it."" Then she regains her brash senses and returns to her rhyming Samantha Jones self, reducing Keith's dick to soft-serve. On ""Bad Babysitter,"" Superstar satirizes what people think of her, playing the craven teenager to the hilt: ""Babysitting sucks but whatever
They got junk food, kung fu, egg fu, Dig Dug, a dog, too
And a hot Jew, Mr. Weintraub, I mean he's old but not dimed out
If I'm bad I'll turn around in the corner for time out
Aiight, Josh, what you wanna do? You wanna watch cartoons?
Platoon, hey get back in the room!
I assume your folks are gonna be out late, go make me Kool Aid
I'm a sit on the couch and masturbate
Then call my boyfriend Gabe and see if he ate
Spit out my Bubbalicious and get to one of them
Big fridges that could fit 10 midgets
Damn, they're rich, hey, she left me fifty dishes
Bitch!"" With ""We Got Panache,"" Princess Superstar outlines her materialistic goals before stating that, no matter what, she's going to party: ""It's ironic how erotic my robotic sonnets
Get girls in bonnets hot like Harry Connicks
Sick on gin and tonics, we super sonic, hook you on our phonics
Learned Ebonics by erotic ebony dick and Mantronix
Never stoppin' it, sock electronic shit allotted
The whole club up when we spotted it
And if we wanted it, fill it with men and spawn and shit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Let's get the party started, shit, let's get it on and hit."" As a hedonist's manifesto, this has decidedly more Fifth Avenue elan than Andrew W.K.'s pre-literate cave-dweller grunts. Though the album showcases lyrical dexterity and directness, the beats that frame them are less finessed. Perhaps the Princess' desire to be perceived as a unique talent has led her to resist mimicking flavor-of-the-month production for a more generic post-Native Tongues sound. Though it's too much to ask that she team up with any of Mille Plateaux's click-hop artists, I'd love to hear this album produced by Vladislav Delay or Kid 606, on the evidence of his reworkings of Missy Elliott. That album would be truly amazing. Having worked for seven or so years in the Manhattan hip-hop community, Princess Superstar is not out to amaze. She wants to get paid and she deserves to. But she's going to be in a precarious position if she's going to become more than a nominal superstar. As well as avoiding becoming a peripheral loudmouth skeeze for some aspiring Roc-A-Fella, she needs to avoid settling for dueting with Gwen Stefani when she should be guesting with Le Tigre. The Princess has, without question, the talent, the wit and the sass to live up to her alias. This record is certainly not the masterpiece I believe she's capable of, but rather, a clear premonition of such an album.","Princess Superstar is not, as many junket-jittery journalists would have you believe, the female Marshall Mathers.

The Green Fury,Matt Pond PA,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e469fc7814a47cd75d/1:1/w_160/7481d941.jpg,2002-02-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5155-the-green-fury/,Polyvinyl,"All right, I'll bite. What does the PA stand for? Preppie Anarchist? Pretentious Asshole? Paranoid Agoraphobic? Popular Arboretum? Partially Anesthetized? Physician's Assistant? Wrong. The PA only stands for Pennsylvania, a rather dull reason to put mysterious letters behind one's name. Not that Pennsylvania is a dull state. Why, without Pennsylvania, we wouldn't have Rolling Rock, the Phillies (hands down, the best logo font in sports), and the Constitution. And even though Pennsylvania's the only state in which I've ever received a speeding ticket, I don't hold a grudge. That may change, however, if I have to keep listening to Matt Pond PA's The Green Fury. The Green Fury = ungood. I don't like it. Boo. The setup behind MPPA is not innately flawed: a melancholy singer/songwriter fleshing out his songs with soaring orchestral arrangements. Some call it chamber-pop, and bands like the Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev pull it off to great effect. Matt Pond PA, on the other hand, is a bit heavy on the chamber and way too light on the pop (not to mention light on the Dave Fridmann, but that can't be helped). Rather than adding depth and creativity, the various strings, horns, keyboards, and vibraphones are all seemingly used to disguise the tepid songs within-- an extravagantly wrapped Christmas present with socks and underwear inside. The blame, therefore, would have to fall squarely on bandleader/songwriter Pond's slumped shoulders. Pond seems to have a knack for writing languid, generic tracks that have all the pop of soggy Rice Krispies. It all depends on your definition, though. If ""pop"" for you means instantly catchy, hummable tunes, you certainly won't find it here. But if ""pop"" means boring verse-chorus-verse song structure, hey, Matt has you covered. As for covering, I'll do my own with a blanket and this CD. Worst of all, there's the more-than-passing resemblance Pond's voice bears to mid-90's frat-house poet Adam Duritz. Pond shares Duritz's habit for introspective warbling, with his vocals cracking oh-so-dramatically in the upper registers. Once you realize this similarity, there's really no going back. The unsurprising result is a textbook case of excessive emoting. Throw in Pond's heavy-handed way with a lyric, and I'm inclined to think him and Duritz are the same person until proven otherwise. Without Pond's tremulous yearning, a handful of the songs (""Measure 3,"" ""Promise the Bite"") might have been enjoyable in an ""aging indie rocker sitting on the porch with a glass of Merlot and a David Foster Wallace novel"" sort of way. Still, the many, many string parts don't do anything on The Green Fury you haven't heard a hundred times before, even if they are well-executed from a technical standpoint. Other instruments aren't so lucky, though: the french horn solo of ""Jefferson"" will surely make Pitchfork's list of Worst French Horn Solos Ever (coming soon!) and I think the last of my patience with the vibraphone was worn down by the record's sixth track. I suppose there are a few other nice things I can say about The Green Fury. The album cover has a nice green-and-yellow plaid pattern on it, for instance, that I wouldn't mind owning in couch or pants form. I'll award the band bonus points for cleverly releasing a preview EP last year called This is Not the Green Fury. And someday, I may likely use Matt Pond PA as proof in an argument over whether independent music is inherently better than major label releases. But other than that, Matt Pond PA is just an easy target for wise-ass negative blurbs. What do you like better: ""No, Mr. Pond, I expect you to die!!!"" or ""This Pond could use a good de-scumming!!!""?","All right, I'll bite. What does the PA stand for? Preppie Anarchist?

Echolocation,Fruit Bats,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4ceb335119a49ed03e/1:1/w_160/c2991892.gif,2002-02-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3229-echolocation/,Perishable,"I've begun to wonder if Angie Aparo and P.J. Olsson distribute their work directly to bargain bins, kind of like Gary Busey does with the video store. For whatever reason, it seems that every used CD store nationwide (including stores in Virginia, Michigan and New York) has multiple copies of Aparo's The American and Olsson's Words for Living (joining, of course, multiple copies of the Verve Pipe's Villains, and a smattering of King's X). I haven't heard much from either artist, but the impression ""the bin"" gives me is that neither is very good. After a recent evening of CD shopping, I could have easily concluded that the Fruit Bats blow. Out of six Manhattan second-hand merchants, four had copies of Echolocation, and although the disc had yet to find the bargain bin in any of them, it seemed their ultimate destiny. The reason I kept an open mind is that I had seen the group in concert, opening for the Shins and Modest Mouse in late September. The show wasn't that great, but it was certainly tolerable, and you could tell that vocalist/songwriter Eric Johnson enjoyed himself on stage and took his job seriously. It's hard to not at least appreciate a guy who loves what he's doing. As the live show was tolerable, so is Echolocation, but not much more. The Fruit Bats seem obsessed with one sound, one that I would describe as folk-country indie-pop, for lack of a more appropriate sub-sub-sub-genre label. In short, lots of acoustic guitar and lazy, slow-rolling sentimental compositions, peppered with banjo, ukulele, piano and pleasant vocal harmonies. Clearly summer-time music. Unfortunately, though, what you hear on the album's first track, ""The Old Black Hole,"" is pretty much what you hear on tracks 2-12. Every song moves at the same country tempo, with the similar sounding folksy accoutrements, and almost-convincing sentimentality. When I forgot I was listening, it was pleasant. When I tuned in more closely, I was left impatient, crying out to the Fruit Bats, ""Go somewhere already!"" In this way, it may have been better if the Fruit Bats were fronted by the other Eric Johnson, of ""Cliffs of Dover"" fame, and friend to fellow G3 Guitar Summit participants Steve Vai and Joe ""Satch"" Satriani. That would have blown my ass off. Then again, I probably wouldn't have been able to hear much ukulele over Johnson's overdriven polyrhythms and unusual dorian modes. Other than infrequent exclamations resulting from my boredom (see above), Echolocation sparked very little reaction from me, either positive or negative. Chances are, I won't listen to it much. Chances are better that I'll be visiting one of those two stores that didn't have a copy.","I've begun to wonder if Angie Aparo and P.J.

Enemies,Pele,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02a13d19756521382f8/1:1/w_160/adb918b0.jpg,2002-02-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6222-enemies/,Polyvinyl,"Ahhh, the girls' locker room. The paradise of every teenage boy's imagination, details filled in by dozens of late 70s/early 80s hard-R comedies from days when gratuitous nudity was still a treasured cinematic tradition. Oh the sexy, sexy things happening in every girls' locker room, just beyond the furrowed brow of a pubescent male population trying to develop X-ray vision. Only the slumber party pillow fight can compete with the girls' locker room showers in evoking imagery that's given rise to a thousand sticky nights. If I'm starting to creep you out a bit (and to tell the truth, I'm starting to creep myself out), it's a reasonable approximation of what I think Pele was going for in claiming that Enemies was recorded in, yep, a girls' locker room. Combined with the unfortunately detailed pencil drawing of the drummer sans garments on his lower half (yes, there is wang), the whole package has a certain sex offender tint to it. Surely, this ploy is intended to counteract the relatively antiseptic nature of the band's chosen genre, instrumental math-rock, whose bands are constantly striving-- tendons taut, foreheads dotted with sweat-- to avoid being considered mere background music. Perhaps they thought a dose of sinisterness would give listeners something they could get a firm grip on, but for all the pent-up fantasies that fueled this record, Enemies doesn't rise to the occasion. Pele are at their best when their compositions feel like progressions rather than a lot of cool-sounding parts somewhat arbitrarily soldered together. ""Safe Dolphin"" has a few dashes of jarring synth thrown in to keep things slightly off-balance, and ""Hospital Sports"" holds its own with mean acoustic/electric guitar interplay. These tracks evolve with admirable patience and a spontaneous feel; if only math-rock fans knew how close some of this material is to that of more accomplished jam bands, they wouldn't be wearing their horn-rims so high. Pele are attempting to fight the rut they've start to mine with the addition of a fourth member, suspiciously credited as playing ""computer + tambourines"" (just like Wilco!). Unfortunately, the software isn't for any of them loops or glitches the kids like these days, but rather for determined attempts at texture. Read: incongruous buzzing and cut-up radio transmissions inserted all over ""Crisis Win"", and mysterious noises that had my orange-alert-skittish heart looking for exploding ordinances on my walk to the subway. The original trio tries to keep pace with this new texture, most of which is similar to the majority of process-driven laptop-jiggering. ""Safe Dolphin"" is almost done in a couple times by quiet sections where the percussion sounds like somebody kicking a trash bag around, while ""Sepit"" uses similar junkyard effects to annoying result. Transitions like ""Hooves""-- an unfortunate misstep into a pile of new age-- and technical workouts like ""Cooking Light"" (where too many people solo at once) don't help matters. Yet Enemies is a complaisant album; enjoyable, but not to the point of sticking long in one's memory. The biggest criticism I could level against Pele could apply to the whole math-rock genre: With Out Hud's S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. still fresh in the underground hive mind, Enemies feels like an unnecessary step back to the days when indie instrumentals weren't so excitingly infected with the disco virus. Despite the palpable horniness its recording environment inspires, Enemies is, like so much of its brethren, an entirely unsexy affair, and thus a rather sterile listen.","Ahhh, the girls' locker room.

Report from Iron Mountain,Date Course Pentagon Royal Garden,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a9c0084474cd0c0e93/1:1/w_160/52637b59.jpg,2002-02-12 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2177-report-from-iron-mountain/,P-Vine,"And just as the early days of man were still dripping from primordial dew, the early form of a band can often be underdeveloped. Consider all the factors. There's the concept, because who doesn't have an angle these days? There's the image: what are they going to stand for, and who's supposed to think they're cool? There's the labor: how will the band get heard, and get its rather angular, imaginary message across? There's the people: what combination of personality disorders will help them achieve all they desire? And lastly, there's the music: what mixture of influences and accidents are they going to hide when their record gets played (hopefully)? It's a wonder bands ever happen at all. The notion of personalities (and their various disorders) should never be underestimated as the band gathers form and direction. I imagine that one or two dominant forces will be the impetus for starting the group, and may preside as reining catalysts for the major decisions at first (see above). Over time, the other members will either go along with the plan, or assert their visions into the group dynamic. Sometimes that means things fall apart, but if not, interesting reactions can happen. Or not. It almost seems a stroke of luck, with no more predetermination than a coin toss, whether the band exists for very long. I've written about a few Japanese bands for Pitchfork, and as you may or may not know, several of the players are known to move in and out of other bands and projects. When I look back on it, many of these projects seem more like one-time affairs, or just chance encounters that happened to be recorded. A few of the projects are long-term, but even many of those feature people who are known better for playing other music, or with other people. I've always wondered how the same pool of talent keeps mixing and remixing with itself to produce so much interesting sound. Of course, the musicians are quite good and experienced and such, but I was taught in Rock Journalism 201 (probably Christgau's section, the old hag) that talent doesn't guarantee anything except raised expectations for the listener. Kikuchi Naruyoshi used to play with a very nice band called Tipographica. They were never a big club act, but maintained a fairly widespread following for fans of avant-garde rock and free jazz, making something of a Zappa noise, though in that infamously hectic Japanese style. Unfortunately, they broke up (personality issues? Money? Ran out of impossibly complicated heads?), and went their own ways. Naruyoshi started playing free improv and spacy fusion with his Tokyo Zawinul Bach duo, maybe because after so many years in a large ensemble (Tipo was six strong), two guys seemed an easier task to manage. But that can't be right, because he then formed a huge band with a huge name called Date Course Pentagon Royal Garden. This band has 10-12 people at any given moment (of which Otomo Yoshihide is probably the most well known in the West, though other eminent figures are involved as well). They also bring a touch of fusion to the mix, but as often will play 20-minute noise-trance, perhaps similar to Rovo (with whom they released a split CD) or even Tortoise if they upped the noise quotient a bit. This is all well and good, but given the fact so many people are involved, and perhaps due to Naruyoshi's relatively quick change in direction, their most recent release seems a tad underdeveloped. Report from Iron Mountain (named after a confidential U.S. government war report from the early 60s, as well as a prominent Japanese ""live-house"" where the band has appeared) features about half lengthy experimental tunes, and half straight ahead funk-fusion. Okay, what's so special about that? ""Catch 22"" starts things off in a very cool way by playing trance from an unbalanced point of view. Multiple drummers play in seemingly multiple meters and tempos, while a Fender Rhodes figure repeats, and synth noise tears apart any unnecessary tonality. A lady says ""I'm something special"" a few times, though it's not as if anyone has to convince me on the merits of turning workaday post-rock into an anarchic symphonette. About midway through, things take a change for the violent, as the tempo increases threefold, and the bass degenerates into a two-note pattern, all the while supporting a very fiery guitar solo. It seems as if Naruyoshi's tendency to jazz things up has been overtaken by the group noise. ""Play Mate at Hanoi"" is much more low-key, almost like something Return to Forever would have done during one of Chick Corea's less dramatic moments. A very 70s analog synthline plays a fluid lead, while the bass and restrained, upbeat percussion accompanies. An organ jumps out of the right speaker, similar to some of the playing on the early Miles Davis fusion records, wherein the organ acted more as a confrontational coloring element than actual comping instrument. This leads to a nice soprano sax solo, and the tune is well within the domain of standard fusion. A pretty abrupt change from the first tune, but that's not really strange in itself. That is, until ""S."" This begins with a very lounge-y funk figure on guitar (surely, not Yoshihide, though he is one of the credited guitar players), and some roller-rink organ. The band enters with congas and something of a samba-rock beat. I step back, and to my horror, realize the band is playing cocktail music, like you hear on cruises and commercials for said cruises. Another soprano solo ensues, and is so smooth I wonder if this is even the same band that played the first song. And it lasts for almost eleven minutes like that! Later, the band pulls a similar trick on their cover of ""Hey Joe,"" playing very standard (and often corny) funk-rock for about ten minutes before I come to the realization they're not going anywhere ironic with this. We're talking music with the edge of a mouthwash ad. There is a bit of redemption in ""Circle/Line~Hard Core Peace,"" where they play more fusion licks, but bring in a touch of polyrhythmic groove, and a tad more excitement to the barrage of soprano solos. However, I'm still left with the sting of unfulfilled promise from the first tune, and wondering if these guys should ever have made this record. Maybe it sounds better live, or perhaps that everything was recorded at different dates (and in three different studios) signifies that the concept for how the band should sound changed from time to time. I'm a huge fan of juxtaposing genres and concepts, and certainly like to see all my favorite players get together, but Report from Iron Mountain seems to me like what happens when group dynamic and development is overwhelmed by lack of focus. As a result, underwhelming.","And just as the early days of man were still dripping from primordial dew, the early form of a band ...

Temptations,Freestyle Fellowship,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be21ea9e61561daa7855/1:1/w_160/51fe6b6c.jpg,2002-02-12 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3189-temptations/,Ground Control,"Operating under the assumption that all freestyle is essentially the same, I will draw all analogies to Freestyle Fellowship's new album, Temptations, from another sort of freestyle: Canine Freestyle. ""Canine Freestyle is choreographed dog performance with music, illustrating the training and joyful relationship of a dog and handler team. Canine Freestyle expands the sport of obedience by broadening the scope of dog training, adding an artistic element through the inclusion of music and dance. The reach, drive and beauty of an athletic, trained dog moving to music can take one's breath away."" --Canine Freestyle Federation Whew, let me catch my breath-- I was just watching some dog freestyle! Although you might imagine that dog freestyle (aka ""The Best Idea Ever"") would bear only a semantic resemblance to the Freestyle Fellowship, you would be gravely wrong. The similarities are actually quite striking. Allow me to elaborate. ""Without sharing would this have happened? No, it would not have happened."" --From the article ""Canine Freestyle: A Point of View"" by Joan Tenille Los Angeles-based hip-hop legends the Freestyle Fellowship share four ways-- between the capable flow of MCs Mikah 9, Self Jupiter, Aceyalone and P.E.A.C.E. None of them sound simply like role-players; each has skills enough to carry an album (and each one of them has). And yet, for one reason or another, they continue to step out of their personal spotlights to contribute to this posse. It's worked well in the past. ""Your dog will quickly learn to recognize his music for his Freestyle. You'll see a new sparkle in his eye, feet stepping higher and a tail wagging harder. A new star is born."" --From the article ""Getting Started with Canine Freestyle,"" by Alison Jaskiewicz The Freestyle Fellowship caught on to the game quickly. Before even signing to a label, the Fellowship owned the L.A. underground scene with bootlegged copies of their 1991 deeper-than-underground debut, To Whom It May Concern. They followed it up with an acknowledged underground masterpiece, Inner City Griots, in 1993. Griots displayed the ample MC skills of the posse-- boisterous, urgent, energetic, and playful. A new star was born. In the eight years hence, however, it looks like the acclaim's gone to their collective heads. As I see it, the Rhyming Confidence Spectrum (RCS) begins at ""cocky"" and runs all the way to ""delusions of Godhood."" In other words, all MCs start out cocky. And cocky is good-- you want a cocky MC. Then, with acclaim, some get fatter in the cranium, believing themselves ""enlightened"" (see Common, Q-Tip), and in the most severe cases, become convinced of their own divinity (see Rakim, Jay Z). Unfortunately, delusions of Godhood, when not actually accompanied by lyrical Godhood, merely spell complacency. With no chip on his shoulder, the MC thinks he's so good that he no longer even bothers to prove it. And on Temptations, the ego trip is intolerable. One especially contrived example comes with ""Fragrance,"" a poetry number based on random vibraphones and guest rapper Abstract Rude going overboard with nonsense cliches like, ""Scattered thoughts of our battered love to its bloody pulp fiction was Tarantino-esque. Ghetto Juliette!"" On other tracks, the guys simply sound older and more complacent, unlike on Inner City Griots, when their youthful exuberance might have even been construed as showing off. But when an MC has the flow of Aceyalone or Mikah 9, you want him to show off. These moments are too rare on Temptations. ""Do I have to dance? No, emphatically no! But, yes, you may."" --From the article ""Canine Freestyle: Do I Have to Dance?"" by Alison Jaskiewicz Do I have to dance to this album? No, emphatically no! But yes, I suppose dancing to Temptations is possible (maybe even with your ""bitch,"" if your dog is a girl). The beats on Temptations truly sound like freestyle beats, as if producer Josef Leimberg had them pre-loaded on his keyboard since 1993, just in case the Fellowship ever decided to show up to the studio. I mean, Inner City Griots's background was never considered especially fresh, but there was charm in those basic beats-- they always seemed so practical, never trying to impress or steal the show from the main attraction. On Temptations, the shit comes off like the ""street"" preset blaring from some imitation Casio keyboard in the back of a Pamida storeroom (check the discount Aceyalone cut, ""Different""). ""Just as in evaluating a dog for conformation where you must consider the whole dog, not just the parts, so when evaluating Freestyle movement, overanalysis of parts-- feet, tail, head, body-- results in loss of the whole picture. You can analyze a Mozart piano concerto note by note and still not fathom the genius of the whole piece. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."" --From the article, ""Music, Rhythm and Freestyle,"" by Alison Jaskiewicz Ms. Jaskiewicz has a good point. While I'll avoid any Mozart references, I do appreciate the general structure of her analogy. The Fellowship has always been about the rhymes. Thus, the ""freestyle"" association. The whole story is that Aceyalone, Mikah 9, P.E.A.C.E. and Saturn still have flow. Sure, that flow has changed with age, but it's still confident and sort-of interesting. The first few tracks, notably ""No Hooks, No Chorus"" and the title track, sound mature but remain fierce. Overall, though, the frenetic spirit displayed on their first two discs has regressed a little, backing up from ""inspiring"" to ""decent."" And for all its flaws, it really isn't a bad disc. Just a disappointing one.","Operating under the assumption that all freestyle is essentially the same, I will draw all analogies to Freestyle Fellowship's ...

Wouldn't You Miss Me: The Best of...,Syd Barrett,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21dc0084474cd0bff86/1:1/w_160/0efe7bb7.jpg,2002-02-12 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/568-wouldnt-you-miss-me-the-best-of/,Capitol,"What is it about depravity that demands attention? From disaster porn to Lifetime movies, our culture loves to vicariously exorcise their diminutive traumas through those whose lives have been wrought with pain. This carries over to the world of music where the dynamic between tragedy and reverence is exalted, rather than critiqued, and personified by such talents as Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, Johnny Ace and, more recently, Mark Sandman. The macabre tales and images of their self-destruction are indelibly linked to the bodies of work they left behind, forever blurring the lines that separate an impartial assessment of their talents from the content of their character. The truth is that the music of those who burn out isn't necessarily judged by a different set of standards so much as it's judged by the standards the artists set for themselves during their creative zeniths. After all, these modern legends posthumously govern a world where rumors and hearsay reach mythical proportions and idolaters devote their entire lives to collecting every shred of sound their own personal God/Goddess ever committed to tape. ""Syd"" Roger Barrett is one of those golden calves, though fashioned by a much different maker. The infamous story of his rise to the forefront of the burgeoning British psychedelic scene in the late 60s-- for those of you not up on your Syd, he was the premier singer/songwriter of Pink Floyd that fell into a drug-induced mania catalyzed by already-prevalent schizophrenic conditions-- has been reiterated, exaggerated, invoked, and novelized so many times that it's arguably overshadowed his seminal contributions to popular music. These contributions-- his two solo albums, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, both released in 1970-- transcend his work with late-60s Pink Floyd and make for haunting aural documents of a prolific talent's dilapidating psyche while paradoxically managing to retain a rich charm and hooks sharp enough to make Peter Pan wet his tights. Discounting a few independently distributed releases and Cleopatra's Octopus, no serious attempt has ever been made to compile the ""best of"" Syd Barrett, let alone to confine the content to his solo material. This may be partially due to the Herculean nature of the task. Though the Madcap's output as a solo artist only adds up to roughly 45 songs (22 of which are contained here), it would be easy for the compiler to fail in their intention, given Syd's penchant for an enduring arrangement and melody. The release of Capitol's Wouldn't You Miss Me, which draws from every facet of Barrett's available recorded output, is certainly no exception, notably omitting ""No Man's Land,"" a common fan favorite, and the stark acoustic demo of ""Rats,"" which is home to some of Barrett's most self-effacing (and successful) stream-of-consciousness, and was originally released with fuller instrumentation on Barrett before finding its way onto Opel, a collection of rarities and outtakes. Regardless, the collection itself is a long overdue acknowledgment of the disarming beauty found in Syd's work outside the psychedelic stratum.","What is it about depravity that demands attention?

Alive to Every Smile,Trembling Blue Stars,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80513d1975652139569/1:1/w_160/d9921383.jpg,2002-02-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8148-alive-to-every-smile/,Sub Pop,"Modern technology sure is swell, isn't it? Today, modern aircraft technology got me from Indianapolis to Boston in six hours, with a stop in Newark in between. Modern airport security technology let the people in charge know that I was carrying metal objects. To my amazement, they ignored it and waved me through without checking me. Luckily for them, I didn't have a revolver strapped to my hip-- rather, I was merely making use of the slightly more archaic pants-retaining technology known as a belt buckle. I guess you could say that all of this falls under the umbrella of using technology for good, even if human misjudgment sometimes interferes with its purpose. Of course, human mismanagement spoils a lot of potentially promising technology on a regular basis-- just look at the music industry. Somewhere along the line, bigshot producers seem to have picked up the idea that if you take a terrible song and dress it up in enough shiny electronic packaging, it will become a good song. At some point, the public apparently confirmed that this idea generates large amounts of income, because it's become fairly standard practice. That's just my theory, of course. Naturally, I have a lot of corollary theories to that one, principle among them being that if overproduction can mask a piece of crap, then it can also mask a gem. Upon listening to Alive to Every Smile, Trembling Blue Stars' fourth album, I found that second theory being proven, and I grinned like the smug bastard that I am. Head Star Robert Wratten (formerly of Field Mice) writes some pretty decent songs, when you break them down to their base elements. The melodies are fine, if unspectacular, and the lyrics are better than average broken heart stories-- suffice to say, Wratten probably has his navel pretty much memorized by now. Unfortunately, producer Ian Catt seems intent on giving Alive to Every Smile a bigger sound than it really needs to get its point across. A lot of bands venture close to soft-rock territory and come out unscathed. Trembling Blue Stars aren't so lucky. The two greatest offenders come back-to-back in the middle of the album. ""Here All Day"" opens with some syrupy organs, over which Wratten intones in his unbelievably fey voice, ""Someone stop the hands of time/ Every tick's a cruel blow."" Multi-tracked female backing vocals swim in Lexicon reverb, invading the second verse before big, booming toms ripped straight from a 1984 top 40 station provide the final scuttling blow. ""Until the Dream Gets Broken"" follows with programmed bongos and the same backing vocals, both featured more prominently this time. The gloss is so blinding that it's difficult to see the song underneath. Those bloody backing vocals pop up all over the place, too, and they never once truly add anything necessary to the song in question. They're just a distracting background texture on the otherwise good ""Ghost of an Unkissed Kiss."" The rest of the arrangement is fine, though, drawing from 80s jangle pop and adding in a nicely executed backward guitar solo for good measure. The refrain of, ""Dry eyes, dry eyes/ It was never going to end with dry eyes,"" is probably the catchiest thing on the album. With a slightly dryer mix, though, it could be more immediate. One improvement Wratten and the band have made since their last effort, 2000's Broken by Whispers, is the fact that their songs now flow a little more smoothly from section to section. A lot of the songs on that album were plagued by jarring transitions from quiet verses to loud, seemingly unrelated choruses. Here, only one song suffers from that affliction. ""Maybe After All"" opens with quietly strummed verses drenched in reverb (there's actually a rather neat little bit of processed hi-hat embedded low in the mix, too), and suddenly transitions after a couple of minutes into a dry verse complete with drums, bass and some nice countermelodic guitar parts. And of course, before long, those damn backing vocals are back, taking up the space that would have sounded better empty. One of the main reasons Alive to Every Smile turns out so disappointing is that it begins on such an interesting note. ""Under Lock and Key"" opens the record with distorted drums and varied tape speeds before a guitar loop enters and Wratten actually says something assertive for once. ""You've got to stop fucking her up/ You've got to grow up,"" he sings to a guy who presumably isn't treating his girlfriend very well. Wratten's guitar tone is thick and commanding-- it reminds you that he can actually really play the thing well. He also handles the backing vocals himself, which is a plus. ""With Every Story"" actually carries on fairly well from there, with Wratten pulling out a good chord progression and a nice, Bernard Sumner-inspired guitar sound, but the sheen that plagues the rest of album begins to creep in, and by the third song there's really no going back. Closer ""Little Gunshots"" makes something of an attempt to darken things a bit with a brooding synth figure, but the textures turn a little too new age-y to be really engaging. By the time the album ends, it's easy to find yourself somewhat sick of Wratten's merciless self-pity, too. He ends things with the lines, ""You're waving from a leaving train/ And every part of me screams your name/ Think again, please think again,"" and it's a bit of a relief knowing that he's finally done complaining. Fans of past Trembling Blue Stars efforts will probably find a lot to enjoy about Alive to Every Smile, even with the overproduction. Most other people would be pretty well-advised to stay away, unless you're desperately seeking an indie-approved gateway into the world of lite FM. Ultimately, the band and their producer fall into the trap of placing too much stock in technology, sadly failing to trust Wratten's songwriting to work on its own. In the end, the surface has become so smooth that there's almost nothing left to grip at all. In the future, Wratten & co. would do well to put yet another theory to work for them: less is more.","Modern technology sure is swell, isn't it?

Calling Albany,Vermont,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a945ea9e61561daa59eb/1:1/w_160/07ec6b44.gif,2002-02-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8449-calling-albany/,Kindercore,"""I would be there, say the word. I'm a straight shooter like Larry Bird."" This is an actual line from one of the songs on Vermont's Calling Albany. Actually, it's not just one line, it's the chorus. I just wanted to get it out there in the open for all to see, and get it away from its buffering support system-- all the other lame, just-barely passable lyrics on the album-- so it can be publicly humiliated. Who actually sits down and puts words like these on paper, scratches their chin, and says, ""Yeah!""? Davey Von Bohlen and Dan Didier from the Promise Ring and Chris Rosenau from Pele, that's who. This is the trio's second album, and after forcing myself through it a few times, here's hoping Vermont's members start spending a lot more time at their day jobs right quick. Not that I was ever much of a fan of the Promise Ring or Pele, but considering that this sounds nothing like either of them, I don't think it's a issue. Judging from the cliché-ridden lyrics showcased here, I can understand why so much Promise Ring material I remember hearing was so terse. Or maybe the bad lyrics were always there, buried under the sugar-sweet pop banality. Regardless, this is not the case with Vermont. The sparse, often acoustic musical backdrop pushes the lyrics to the fore, and, to put it plainly, they don't hold up well under the increased scrutiny. The melodramatic posturing and self-pity that was kept (more) in check in the Promise Ring is given free reign with Vermont, and nearly every song title is a heavy-handed attempt at a pun or some other half-assed witticism, which makes the ultra-serious vocal delivery and stark instrumentation even more annoying. Besides the above quoted nadir, there are a few other noteworthy low points on Calling Albany. To start from the bottom, there's a (near) cover of the Commodores' ""Three Times a Lady"" nestled within a song called ""Commodores 64."" Done up all singer/songwriterly, the slow jam classic becomes a maudlin joke. Now's a good time to remind Vermont that we're not in the High Age of Slacker Irony anymore; the days of the Cardigans covering Sabbath are long gone (and surely even these guys can appreciate that). These days, people just don't get away with this kind of thing unless a little something extra is brought to the table. On ""Chlorine Chlorine,"" we're given the standard emo-rock workout while being told, ""I like books better than movies"" (gee, smart and sensitive-- do I smell a ""Gilmore Girls"" guest shot?), and the untitled fourth songs (denoted by a red dot on the sleeve) is an adolescence tale of striving for independence from Mom and Dad while lamenting anonymity at the local coffeeshop. Then there's the opener, ""Bells of Saint Alcohol,"" Vermont's stab at creating some kind of rote emo-country sub-genre. With a slow, rambling tempo and accordion support, the music is nice enough, but add the lyrics to the mix and it sound like castrated Bright Eyes. At best. I could only recommend Calling Albany to someone if they were really, really hard up for something new from Pedro the Lion, but even then I couldn't do it with an absolute clear conscience. As for everyone else, I insist you stay as far away from this record as possible.","""I would be there, say the word. I'm a straight shooter like Larry Bird.""

Electric Ladyland: Clickhop Version 1.0,Various Artists,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b0ea9e61561daa5642/1:1/w_160/bac7c03e.jpg,2002-02-11 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1932-electric-ladyland-clickhop-version-10/,Mille Plateaux,"Used to be that I'd define the music I bought and enjoyed by genres. I liked rock music and jazz. I didn't like hip-hop or country. But after I started working, and was able to buy more music, I found my tastes had developed. I no longer limited my purchases to certain genres, and as a result I began to discover musicians of all stripes I enjoyed. But not everyone's musical taste grows up along with them. Many continue to depend on genres rather than sound to decide what they'll try. Many continue to make brash all-encompassing statements like, ""I don't like dance music,"" or ""I don't like classical music,"" well into their middle-ages and beyond. Consider Electric Ladyland: Clickhop Version 1.0, an attempted public service from Mille Plateaux (yes, the same often-revolutionary Mille Plateaux label that also brought us the Clicks and Cuts series). Following in the footsteps of Prefuse 73's Scott Herren, Machine Drum and other like-minded acts, the artists assembled on this two-disc collection dedicate themselves to furthering the recent trend that sees the shrinking of the gap between hip-hop, dance and electronic music. The results are as varied as are the approaches. On the sparse ""M 06 Short,"" alva.noto sculpts quiet beats out of static. Safety Scissors contributes an eminently danceable soundscape of chopped-up samples with ""Mr. Blister is Connected to My Fingers."" And there's Spectre's minimalist instrumental, ""Infra-Red (Danse of the Dead Part 2),"" which gets more mileage out of three or four samples-- chopped up and pitch-shifted, naturally-- and a simple beat than many artists get out of a full record library. That benchmark of hip-hop/electronic amalgamations, the now-trademarked Prefuse 73-style chopped-up vocal manipulations, shows up a few times here-- most effectively on Andreas Tilliander's spastic ""Hastjobb"" and AGF/DLAY's opener ""The Return of Us."" It's an interesting-sounding technique, and its popularity is justified, but listening to the lyrics on Electric Ladyland's other vocal tracks, one begins to wonder if there isn't another reason why garbled vocals seem to appear almost as often as the real thing these days. With the exception of Dälek's rhymes about revolution and fellowship on Kid606's remix of ""R. U. IN IT"" (at least, those parts not totally obscured by spastic strokes of noise), the vocals on Electric Ladyland rarely merit much notice. At best, we get self-aggrandizing wordplay from Antipop Consortium's High Priest. At worst, Graphit E ponders the location of his niggas. All around there's an unfortunate feeling that someone somewhere decided that lyrical content doesn't matter so long as the music behind the words is unique, an unfortunate decision that keeps Electric Ladyland from achieving all it might have. Also disappointing (by no fault of the artists-- I lay the blame on the comp's producer) are contributions by Captain Comatose and German house stars MRI which make extensive use of the same female vocal track. While this could have been an interesting experiment, there's little with which to differentiate the two tracks, especially considering that both accompany the singer's pontifications with a driving bassline, bleeps and little flourishes circling a beat. Still, there are a lot of solid tracks here. Frank Bretschneider's ""Holt"" is a simple yet effective downtempo number built around a handful of resonating, electronically produced tones and crackling percussion. Auch's ""All That Pretty Horses"" starts off heading in the same direction, but takes a wrong turn somewhere along the line into a minefield of commonplace glitchery. Towering above all the rest, though, is Akufen's contribution, a track called ""Little Hop of Horror,"" that begins with the cacophonous static and random noise of a manipulated radio tuning knob, before finally tuning in on a laid-back, guitar-based funk groove. As the song plays out, Akufen makes unpredictable loops out of the bits of static and random radio sounds. While many of the tracks here entertain, this is one of the few that truly succeeds in merging elements of experimental, dance and hip-hop. Ultimately, the biggest problem with Electric Ladyland is that, in its admittedly noble attempt to disregard genre lines, it tends to come up short where cohesiveness is concerned. Though its goal is, without a doubt, to open the minds of listeners to other musical possibilities, I can't help but feel that some of the straightforward 4/4 time dance tracks, like Sophie Anderson's ""Don't Follow"" will grate on those listeners who get a kick out of more experimental fare like ""Hastjobb"" and vice versa. More tracks like Akufen's would have made for a more compelling compilation-- one with a stronger unifying theme. Instead, Electric Ladyland is just a collection of solid songs. This is hardly a bad thing, but if compilations are to be held to the same standards as straight-up albums, then it's impossible to deny that this one seems a bit lost at times. In many ways, hip-hop, dance and electronic music have grown up next door to one another. Each existed for ages as a vague idea rather than as an actual genre or style; all three came into their own in the 80s; and all gained mainstream appreciation in the 90s. Today, we often see hip-hop, dance and electronic music pandering to the masses, cheap bastardizations of brilliant work masquerading as the real thing. So it's reassuring to know that there are artists-- just as there have been since the early 20th century-- toiling away in relative obscurity, ensuring that both genres continue to develop. Maybe one day, thanks to their work, no one will miss out on great music due to some prejudicial, predetermined notion of genre. In the meantime, the enlightened among us can enjoy Electric Ladyland: Clickhop Version 1.0.","Used to be that I'd define the music I bought and enjoyed by genres. I liked rock\n\ music ...

Songbird Suite,Susie Ibarra Trio,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c19bea9e61561daa7ded/1:1/w_160/08b71ab9.gif,2002-02-11 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4043-songbird-suite/,Tzadik,"John Zorn's Tzadik label works with some of the best improvisers in the world, but it often focuses on their work as composers. Musicians who routinely play a whole set without a written note can turn around and make albums where their writing dictates the flow of performance-- working in a mix of improv and composition that aims to be more refined and maybe more high-brow than free jazz. Susie Ibarra, the star drummer who has collaborated on high-intensity jazz gigs with David S. Ware and William Parker (as well touring with Yo La Tengo and adding percussive effects to their And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out), has recorded two albums on Tzadik that showcase her spacious writing. Her second and most recent album, Songbird Suite, uses an all-star trio (plus guest Ikue Mori) to perform a set of austere and beautiful pieces. Ibarra kicks off the album by taking the trio out for a spin. She's joined by Craig Taborn on piano, keyboards, and electronics, and Jennifer Choi on violin. On the straightforward ""Azul,"" Taborn and Choi's solos demonstrate their unique approaches. Taborn, who made his name with James Carter and has stolen the show in several avant-jazz combos, demonstrates why he's one of the most inventive and fun pianists out there: his solo is rigorous but joyful, busy but methodical. It churns with enthusiastic clusters of sound. Choi, a classically trained violinist, is aggressively virtuosic: she swoops around the melody like a canary tied to a firecracker, working an array of sounds from her instrument. Ibarra doesn't showcase her own playing until her drum feature ""Trance #1"": her performance is reflective and full of silence, with Asian-sounding percussion complementing her drumkit. These players are as attentive to sound and texture as to the notes, and Ibarra's compositions give them a variety of frameworks. The title track, the album's centerpiece, lets the trio explores open space: Taborn begins with quiet, sonar-like electronics, and Choi and Ibarra ease in with stark splashes of color. Taborn has rarely played piano and electronics on the same album, let alone on the same song (as he does for ""Flower After Flower""); this album is a great example of how expansive his palette has become. Choi's statements and Ibarra's interjections complement Taborn to make a complete sound world-- so complete that when they include an actual birdsong recording on the track, the effect is clumsily literal. It's an equal trio on the slow numbers, but on the busier tunes, Taborn and Ibarra become a steadier rhythm section behind Choi's violin. ""Nocturne"" starts with another soaring, fiery violin solo propelled by Taborn and Ibarra. The squeaking extremes of her high register give way to an eerie, distant sound in the quiet section, and then a jittery conclusion where each player creates arch, precise lines. Ikue Mori, a Tzadik regular and a leading improviser on laptop computer, plays on three tracks-- an improvised duet with Ibarra, and two group pieces. Mori's burbling, percussive samples add to the slow burn of ""Flower After Flower"" and ""Trance #3."" Her sound is busier and slightly less compelling than the other three musicians', but she adds an interesting commentary, and her duet with Ibarra, ""Trance #2,"" is a short, fascinating soundscape of otherworldly percussion sounds. With this concise album-- just forty-five minutes for nine tunes-- the trio thoroughly explores Ibarra's writing. Songbird Suite exemplifies what Tzadik's composer-focused imprints aim for: an album of new music that shows the best collaboration between an open-minded composer and sympathetic improvisers.","John Zorn's Tzadik label works with some of the best improvisers in the world, but it often focuses on ...

First Born,Eyedea & Abilities,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdac0084474cd0c2b94/1:1/w_160/ac2045ee.gif,2002-02-10 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2885-first-born/,Rhymesayers,"At 22, Minneapolis MC Eyedea's trophy case sports a fair amount of ghetto chic, featuring championships at the 2000 HBO World Blaze Battle, the 2000 Rocksteady MC Battle and the 1999 Scribble MC Battle. His DJ and producer, Abilities, has done fairly well himself, scoring two Regional DMC championships. Well decorated, however, does not always spell artistic excellence-- case in point, Sinbad and Star Search. This is especially true in the world of hip-hop, where so many people generally ""just don't give a fuck."" But what matters most in hip-hop is whether you've got the skills to pay the bills. And in this sense, it seems that Eyedea and Abilities are worthy of their accolades. The focal point of the duo is Eyedea, a contemplative rapper who's most conscious of two things-- who he is (or isn't) and how much he rules. At one moment, we find Eyedea picturing his life as a fish (as on the tripped-out ""Fish"" trilogy), or doubting his corporeal existence (as on ""Color My World Mine""); the next, he's pulling a lyrical Kaiser Soze with his retrospective battling on ""Big Shots."" His lyrical talents are no less impressive than his mood swings, showing variation in meter, tempo and vocal tone (although it's always a little nasally and heavy on enunciation). The beats and scratches, from the mind and wrists of Abilities, are comparatively simple. The simplicity rears its head in the drums; you won't hear much more than firm, straightforward machine-beats on First Born. No copped drum breaks, shuffles, or funky percussion-- just beats, just background. The rest of the mix, however, is a bit more jazzy and quirky, blending piano, flute, organ vamps, vibraphones, and some basic samples. Then, of course, there's Abilities' ""abilities""-- the wheels of steel-- which blend skillfully in the mix without sounding too apparent. His restraint lends a good deal of coherence to the album. Unfortunately, this simplistic sound also leads to a mix too weak and reserved for Eyedea's ample mic skills. Is there a rule against pairing complex, wicked beats with hype MCs? Must we save these beats for Trick Daddy? You get the feeling that any track with an MC as biting and incisive as Eyedea, with a vocal tone with as much attack as his, could really bounce.

Nice,Rollins Band,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d6c0084474cd0bfc7c/1:1/w_160/ddcdeb3a.jpg,2002-02-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6824-nice/,Sanctuary,"Relevance in music is overrated. As far as I can tell, it's usually an excuse to say, ""I don't understand this,"" or, ""This isn't cool,"" and very rarely an actual signifier of the importance something has within a greater context. Furthermore, often very interesting ideas can be swept under the rug at the behest of greater ""relevance"": where was common sense when Mozart couldn't get a gig, or when Decca passed up signing the Beatles in 1962 because ""guitar pop was on the way out""? Of course, you can't really blame the folks who missed out, because they really weren't doing anything worse than living within the framework of their society, and how can anyone really do better? That said, Henry Rollins' latest release, Nice, is utterly irrelevant in the context of almost every other album reviewed at Pitchfork. It's too macho to be indie, too rock to be punk, too ""in your face, to tha X-treme"" to be current, too Guitar Center to be Amoeba. It is certainly too Rollins to be subtle or multi-dimensional. Sure, the guy has come a long way since Black Flag, but in the wrong direction. You'd think someone with his IQ (I can't vouch for that, but a couple of his spoken word routines had things to ponder) would either 1) find a way to channel his energy into music with as much, 2) find a ways make something that didn't recall David Lee Roth solo albums, or 3) very quickly find a way to make his yell-song vocal stylings more interesting by, I don't know, not yelling every single song, all the time. Now, just because Rollins doesn't sound like he has a place among the new rock canon doesn't mean that his album is bad. But it is one of the least interesting things I've heard in a while-- and that includes Terry Bradshaw and Paul McCartney at the Superbowl. I suppose there is something to be said for him sticking to his guns and all, but that's all I'm going to say about that at the moment. ""Hangin' Around,"" ""One Shot"" and ""What's the Matter, Man"" are all heavy rockers, featuring a more-hyped-up-than-usual Rollins over the top (literally, of course). However, what really links these tunes is that they could all be featured under a WWF highlight reel. The band plays with a lot of energy, though are necessarily in the background to accommodate Rollins' yelp. Guitars crunch, drums play fills that would make Terry Bozio proud, and if muscle is your mode, it may work. However, Rollins drops lines like, ""What's hard to an alien man?/ Well, you never know what's real"" (huh?) and, ""I am calm hot animal/ Gratefully guilty as charged"" (I see), and turns a perfectly acceptable cock-rock session into Incredibly Bad Poetry. A couple of left turns do spice up the mix: ""Up for It"" is something of a James Brown tribute, with faux-""Mother Popcorn"" guitar and slinky groove (""The day to day can become such a trip/ The mediocre can make you lose your grip""-- now he tells me). Rollins does the Godfather one better by bringing in some Pointer Sisters-esque background singers (!) and uttering the phrase ""I'm up for it"" not less than 28 times during the song. ""I Want So Much More"" starts out on a bad foot (James Brown would never do that) by letting us know that Rollins ""want[s] so much more"" four times at the beginning of the song, and retaining the soul singers (who, to their credit, are probably doing as well with the material as you could expect). However, its down-tempo groove, machine gun trumpet hits (yes) and ornery sax solo do make it something of a 70s cop-show back-alley-chase soundtrack. Anyway, it's the most distinctive tune on the disc, so enjoy it while it lasts. Other tunes range from rigid, fake Zep (""Hello"") to by-the-numbers punk (""Gone Inside the Zero""), which should be a surprise, though music probably isn't Rollins' main game. In fact, I wonder what would happen if Rollins were to ever attempt making another punk record. He seems to have plenty to say, and the energy level thing won't be an issue. The funny thing with him is that since he doesn't seem to care about his image anymore (which could be cool in itself), you'd think he'd be making records that challenged someone's idea of what new rock sounded like. No dice, but don't lose faith, because Rollins wants so much more. He wants so much more. Henry Rollins wants so much more.","Relevance in music is overrated.

Nu Bop,Matthew Shipp,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d4c0084474cd0c035a/1:1/w_160/abcf0675.jpg,2002-02-10 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7116-nu-bop/,Thirsty Ear,"Pianist Matthew Shipp would be infuriatingly overconfident if he didn't back himself up so well. Beginning in 2000 with Pastoral Composure, and moving on through New Orbit (see the phrase in the liner notes: ""Cosmic Consciousness"") and his work with the David S. Ware Quartet on their Corridors and Parallels, the man seems to be suggesting he's onto some kind of metaspatial physics that's all his own. Corridors and Parallels may actually have been a slight low point for Shipp; trading piano for Korg synthesizer might have looked good on paper, but in practice the ethereal tones didn't integrate well with the earthy flavor of Ware & Co. But now Shipp's back with Nu Bop, the latest record in Thirsty Ear's Blue Series. This time around, he's brought in musician and producer Chris Flam to add electronic beats to the mix, and the results are solid. Of course, you can't approach greatness in jazz without punning on your name. So Nu Bop begins with ""Space Shipp,"" and the scrunchy beats make themselves evident immediately. They don't play into fashions like jungle, just squelch mechanically as Shipp pounds along and bassist William Parker grooves concordantly. Guillermo E. Brown's percussion rumbles along with the programmed rhythms, kicking up some hip-hop influence, and Shipp gets inspired and tickles all up and down the scales. The title track sees Parker in funk mode, bobbing lightly along with the drum breaks until Brown adds a whole other layer of bass drum rolls and cymbal crashes to the bricolage. And speaking of which, the breaks (not to mention to cover art) do bear a strong resemblance to Amon Tobin, but then Daniel Carter's alto sax wails off in some strangely muted distance and Shipp rushes in after four minutes like a surprise. Flam's beats, for the most part, were laid down before the sessions, and taken into the studio so the musicians could improvise over them. Shipp's playing is based on individual notes rather than the dense harmonic flurries he used to be known for. The danger, of course, is pulling a Doo-Bop a la Miles Davis-- downplaying your skills to cut a pop record and grab at hipster cred. But Shipp drops accents in unexpected, slightly off-meter places, as on ""D's Choice,"" an all-out jam between Shipp's Monk-like plunks, Brown's sharp snaps, and some chirpy synth beats. Shipp may call the album Nu Bop, but the arrangements here are more influenced by the birth of the cool. The small amount of players allows the musical inputs to mix seamlessly, and amazingly, it never sounds like ""Shipp remixed."" The only time the processing draws attention to itself as something added is on ""Select Mode 1,"" a little minute-and-a-half throwaway jam whose keyboard-demo riddim track should have just been scrapped. ""ZX-1,"" a solo piece by Shipp, breaks the fast flow of the other tracks for some introspection. The minor-key chords reverberate from deep in the chamber, bringing a feeling of melancholy until he slips into the upper registers and becomes perplexingly both lighter in tone and yet more tense. Near the end, ""Nu Abstract"" finds Shipp caged, emitting discordant echoes as a nebula of pulsing drones swells beneath him. He's familiar with this type of soupy ambience from his work on Spring Heel Jack's Masses project, and the piece radiates the same ominous vibes. But more often, this album is about percussive synthesis, as on ""Rocket Shipp,"" with Shipp tumbling precariously across the ivories and Parker practically slapping his bass. Brown is so energetic and the drum tracks are so interwoven that at times it's hard to tell where flesh ends and bytes begin. Shipp and company have a feat worthy of the fractal juxtapositions and futurist font on the album sleeve: they've laid down a fusion record that doesn't fall into limp acid-jazz wank or pop posturing. But to do so, they may have sacrificed a bit of humor. For all the enthusiasm in their playing, they've used a very monochromatic palette here. The serious tone is most apparent in Shipp, whose dark, monolithic thunks bespeak a certain singularity of purpose. I find myself wishing for another moment or two like ""X-Ray,"" which features a serene flute melody from Daniel Carter. Nu Bop doesn't quite reach the lyrical beauty of New Orbit, but it's clear that the guys haven't set out to do anything but record a hell of a funky album. As Shipp says at the end of a track, ""You know it took a minute for my brain to go dead, once that happened I was in it!"" At forty minutes, this is another short but sweet entry in the Blue Series, and according to Shipp, there are more on the way.","Pianist Matthew Shipp would be infuriatingly overconfident if he didn't back himself up so well.

Owen,Owen,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba265e6ef95969322b25/1:1/w_160/c41c7de9.jpg,2002-02-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6072-owen/,Polyvinyl,"Owen is the new miracle drug for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The FDA has begun testing it as anal ternative general anesthesia for certain surgical procedures. Law enforcement officials have suggested using it to subdue anti-globalization protesters at this summer's WTO rally. I'm saying Owen's debut album is going to put you to sleep here, people! Which is not necessarily a bad thing. As I grow older, sleep is quickly becoming one of my favorite activities, and an album that assists me in the process can hold a very special place in my collection. Sedative qualities don't have to equal boring; it can also mean the music is just pleasant or comforting. At the end of a long, hard day, I like nothing more than putting a CD in my stereo and gently drifting off to sleep, something that's hard to do with the Ramones or Jay-Z on. Owen, by the way, is not a guy named Owen, but the solo project of one Mike Kinsella, indie-rock journeyman formerly/currently of American Football, Joan of Arc, and Owls. Why Kinsella would name his one-man band Owen rather than, say, Mike, is a mystery, though I like to think that it's in tribute to mid-80s Red Sox shortstop Spike Owen. Not likely, but a nice scenario. Kinsella pulls off his musical sandman act by primarily utilizing that most sleepy of instruments, the acoustic guitar. Eschewing chord strumming for delicate, dreamy finger-picking, Owen's songs generally sit on a central riff repeated for the three- or four-minute duration, lulling the listener into a hypnotic state. Kinsella's just-above-a-whisper vocals also soothe the ear, a million miles away from the throaty yelp of his brother Tim and generally avoiding typical verse-chorus structure or melody. If this all sounds like an unplugged version of American Football, you're mostly right. But the setting is considerably more intimate on Owen, without Kinsella's earlier vehicle's spiraling guitar epics and octopus drumming. Also gone is the post-breakup open wound nature of American Football's lyrics, the raw honesty of which could provoke weeping fits or retching, depending on one's tolerance for emoting. Instead, Owen's themes are considerably less traumatic, if not exactly sunshine and lollipops (one song is called ""Declaration of Incompetence""). And when drums-- organic or programmed-- are added into the mix, they're sedate and simple, keeping the tunes from floating off into space without disrupting the relaxed tone. The other instrumental flourishes Kinsella adds to the mix-- vibraphone, organ, strings-- similarly add depth and color to his compositions without becoming a distraction. The combination works best on the album closer, ""Think About It,"" which progresses patiently through three distinct movements over its seven-minute run time. Many of the tracks are seamlessly blended into one another, maintaining the warm, drowsy glow with brief instrumental passages. ""Accidentally"" serves as the strongest of these, as Kinsella slowly overdubs more and more guitars playing complimenting themes until the song builds into a soft, cushy pillow of... zzzzzzzz... Whoa. Sorry about that. Given the above description, it'd be easy to categorize Owen as mope-core, or slow-core, or curl-up-in-the-fetal-position-and-have-a-good-cry-core. Correct, too; Kinsella invites the comparison himself by not too subtly mimicking the Red House Painters on ""Places to Go."" But while Owen adds little to the genre's customary sound, one has to admit he does it well by not letting the tortoise-like pace get too monotonous. Obviously then, if this kind of subdued, contemplative music makes you want to kick someone in the groin, Owen should not be placed on your to-buy list. But if you're more receptive to sad white guys making music in their bedroom, or if your prescription for Valium is running out, it might be for you. Just don't operate any heavy machinery during use.","Owen is the new miracle drug for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The FDA has begun testing it as anal ...

Age of the Sun,The Sunshine Fix,by: David M.

And with good reason. In small doses, all three are great things, liable to cheer you up, or at the very least, illuminate a situation in a way uniquely their own. But too much of any of these things can be a problem. Too much sun will give you cancer. Too much Beatles will leave your mind a mess of muddled harmonies, celebrity worship and lame conspiracy theories. Too many psychedelic drugs will turn you into a self-obsessed freak (like, say, Neu!'s Klaus Dinger). Too much. This is a problem that the Bill Doss has. There's lots of good stuff on Age of the Sun, the new album from his new-ish band the (ahem) Sunshine Fix. It's just that sometimes, there's a bit too much of it. Take that sun, for example. It's in the name of the band; it's in the title of the album; it's one of the first and last words sung on the album; and more than half the songs appropriate it as a theme. Now, doubtless, the sun plays an important role in all of our lives (the loyal vampire portion of Pitchfork's readership notwithstanding), but this sort of obsessiveness is just plain unhealthy. Unhealthy and tiresome. Just as a bright, sunny day can come as a slap in the face if you're in the wrong mood, so, too, can this constant elaboration on the same theme get a little irritating. The music, on the other hand, doesn't, which comes as something of a surprise. It's not everyday that I, a bitter, wearied critic, stumble upon pop music varied enough that it not only grabs my attention, but also hangs onto it. Granted, there's nothing on Age of the Sun that's quite up to par with the work of Doss' former bandmate (Circulatory System's Will Cullen Hart), but then, little more than constant disappointment can come from expecting every record to be a masterpiece. But Age of the Sun does have some very strong moments. Like the two wobbly, distorted guitars that do battle on the instrumental track ""Inside the Nebula"" while crackling static and a sturdy bassline keep time. As this short number nears its end, a simple piano melody lingers in the background, before everything cuts out, then back in, then back out, then back in, then out for good. If that bit of piano sounds familiar, it's because it's playing the same faux-ragtime bit that served as a bridge between ""Everything is Waking""-- one of the most OTC-sounding songs on the album, replete with a melancholy refrain with vocal harmonizing and guitar riffs right off The White Album-- and ""Digging to China,"" one of the more straightforward tracks here. The Sunshine Fix is a bit more straightforward than OTC or Circulatory System. Sure, lots of the trademarks remain-- songs linked together by stray musical digressions, short bits of strangeness between songs, recurring singsong melodies, etc. But there's more focus here on the pop than the psychedelic. That's not to say Age of the Sun isn't without its out-there psychedelic moments, just that Doss is more interested in layering piles of horns, guitars, bass, drums, strings, organs, harmonizing vocals and feedback on top of each other for that glorious wall of sound effect than he is in twisting your mind around in circles from chasing after stray bits of hallucinatory noise gone awry. Ultimately, this is a pretty solid effort, especially from the man often assumed to be the lesser half of the OTC equation. Sure, there are moments that get annoying-- like ""Le Roi Soleil,"" which ends the album by stretching one syllable's vocal harmony over the course of twenty minutes. And sure, the whole ordeal could benefit from a bit of thematic variety. But there are also lots of strong moments, like the way the simple acoustic number, ""Cycles of Time,"" serves as a breather following the swarming grandiose of ""72 Years,"" Age of the Sun's grand finale (provided you discount ""Le Roi""). Age of the Sun may not be the defining achievement of pop music that Black Foliage was, and it may not reach quite the heights of his counterpart Hart's finest efforts, but it's still one of the stronger straight-up pop albums I've heard in a while. At his worst, Doss is prone to over-indulgence. But at his best, he proves himself a more-than-capable songwriter and arranger. If he ever learns to respect his limitations, why, there's no telling what he might achieve.","After listening to Age of the Sun, I feel safe making an assumption: The Bill Doss (formerly of the Olivia ...

Dead Media,Hefner,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c09ceb335119a49ed405/1:1/w_160/5cfcbee8.jpg,2002-02-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3802-dead-media/,Too Pure,"We're all suckers for sentimentality, but typically we ourselves choose the objects of our sentiment and find it irritating to have to endure another's. Listening to Hefner's latest release, Dead Media, comes across as just such a laborious experience. For whatever reason, Hefner made a conscious decision to strip down their sound, retreating to their bedrooms with analog synths and an eight-track recorder. To cop Thoreau: ""to record so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not music, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive music into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms."" The result of this self-imposed hermeticism is neither mean nor sublime, but simply trite. What's good for the soul isn't necessarily good for the ear. Jan Hammer and Yaz are good in small doses, but they're mostly good for a chuckle. I might download a few tracks in homage to Sonny Crockett, Ricardo Tubbs and immortal Miami pastel cool, but I'd never want to sit through an entire album of hollow, pre-programmed beats and electronic handclaps. With this release, Hefner apparently feels it's time for a revival of these clichés. Dead Media works on occasion, but primarily when Hefner revert to the traditional pop trio format of bass, guitar, drums. Songs like ""The King of Summer"" show off the band's potential songwriting prowess, but most of the songs here are blatantly precious and generally as awkward as their primary subject matter-- puppy love and early teenage sexuality. ""Peppermint Taste"" is a fine example, a reminiscence of a first kiss and feel-up under a tree which tries to counter the obvious and squeamish delivery with what I imagine are supposed to be biting comments: ""Now it's been twenty years, I bet you kiss real good/ I bet you kiss your banker like a banker's wife should."" As with most of the attempts at irony throughout Dead Media, it falls flat. The only track in this ""experimental mode"" that works is ""Alan Bean,"" a ""Major Tom""-style space adventure that's successful because the campy synths and space sounds give the song a cartoonish quality that belies its desperation and hope. There are also some passable songs, like ""Junk"" and ""When the Angels Play Their Drums,"" but then there are others like ""China Crisis"" which are handled so ineptly that they inspire three solid minutes of cringing. It's clear that Hefner's intention was to take complete control of the creative process by living with these machines for a while, and to create a little masterpiece of Brian Wilson-esque simplicity and charm. But obviously, they're not quite so deft with this equipment as Wilson was, and it all comes off as a bunch of sophomoric tinkering. If they felt that this amateurish sound would illicit a flood of vintage memories and a collective sentimental sigh of recognition, they were just plain wrong. For me, it actually has the opposite effect: a shriek of recognition and a dash for the stop button. You're better off sticking with vintage Pet Shop Boys and ABC.","We're all suckers for sentimentality, but typically we ourselves choose the objects\n\ of our sentiment and find it ...

It strikes when you've spent too much time out of the spotlight. The leader of the band stands up front telling every man, woman and child in the room to squeeze his lemon; the sideman hangs back and makes sure his bass stays in tune. He helps load the t-shirts into the van, though his face is never on them. Someone has to sell the show, and someone has to keep it together. Miighty Flashlight is Mike Fellows. Fellows played bass for seminal D.C. hardcore band Rites of Spring; he was one of the members who didn't later play in Fugazi. He's worked with such alt-country V.I.P.'s as Papa M, Will Oldham, and the Silver Jews. Now armed only with a couple guitars, a Powerbook, and his down-home vocals, Fellows has a solo project to record and tour with his own songs. His debut album is a short backyard barbecue, with high potential and mild impact. Over his acoustic and electric guitars, Fellows gently adds samples with his Powerbook, managing to stray far from obvious or clumsy sounds. And only upon close inspection do you notice how extensively he uses these sounds-- for accents, ambience, or even the foundation of a tune, as with the catchy flute hook of ""Ventilating Zephyrs,"" or the effects that gird the melody of ""Hala Hanan Di Halida."" The instrumental ""Go On. Die. It's Easy"" layers subtle sounds over the acoustic guitars, from a low buzzing drone to a drum machine fill that may be Miighty Flashlight's only cliché; on other tracks, the piano samples sound like they come from an upright sitting in Fellows' living room. And his vocals-- subdued, a little raw, and sometimes hard to interpret-- fit right in without knocking anything loose. He sings like the guy at a party who mutters, ""Sure's been tough since the wife left."" Like he wants you to know, but won't make a big deal of it. Unfortunately, the perfect arrangements make the album a bit too subtle. It doesn't rock and it doesn't ache. ""Ballet Skool"" has grown on me, with its spare electric guitar line and its connotations of regrets and mistakes; but like most of the lyrics here, the words are cryptic and it's difficult to discern what Fellows is trying to say (""On top of ballet school / Don't let me be misdiagnosed""). And as for the three instrumentals, ""Go On..."" is more than enough; the other two, ""Fatherland Focus"" and ""Forget This Space,"" are built on sub-John Fahey riffs that just coast by unconvincingly. These songs might be likeable and masterfully crafted, but they could use an extra kick to keep us interested.","Mike Fellows has symptoms of ""sideman's disease.""

Its core members-- Krassner, violinist Jessica Billey, Pinetop Seven bassist Ryan Hembrey, percussionist Glenn Kotche (now the drummer for Wilco), super-cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm, and ex-Souled American guitarist Scott Tuma-- created a unique fusion of country, jazz, classical, and post-rock noise, augmented by the inclusion of an itinerant band of musical cohorts. The resulting sound-- an eccentric, exquisite genre-bender-- became a kind of introspective late night standard for devotees of the beautifully cool, or coolly beautiful. In early 2001, the core members reconvened after a hiatus (allowing for further entries on their already impressive resumes) to record Two Brothers, with the musical assistance of such luminaries as Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, Jim White and Mick Turner of the Dirty Three, and Jeff Parker of Tortoise and Isotope 217. That Two Brothers doesn't sound a whole hell of a lot like anything else is commendable, but tricky. It's a testament to Krassner's direction that the individual players coalesce into a single sound-- a true ensemble, if you will. However, the first blush consumer who buys this disc for the trademark sound of one of its contributors will find herself spending hours in front of the speakers trying to pick apart the sounds. Unless your ear is a lot better than mine, you'll probably give up and consider that Krassner's decision to not list the players on each track merely forwards the premise of creating a true ensemble. The thematic core here seems to be the subversion of traditional American song. This is fairly dark stuff, and I mean that quite literally. Krassner prefers the minor key, and most of the songs are performed at a dirge-like tempo, with Billey's plaintive violin and Lonberg-Holm's cello providing the meat of the melody. The mournful variation ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" ushers in a trio of affecting cuts, including the haunting 18-minute title cut, ""The Half-Light"" (which features Gregorio's impressive clarinet work), and the gorgeous ""Requiem."" A violin line that calls to mind a patch of desolate American Gothic will suddenly give way to a sampled siren. Listener loss of context may ensue. For an album that carefully dances around the edges of the avant-garde, Two Brothers never stings you with its pretensions. Listening to this record is near effortless, and at the risk of sounding romantic and maudlin, I'll shy from using words like ""transcendent,"" even if that is what comes to mind.","The Chicago-based Boxhead Ensemble first convened in 1996, under the direction of the Lofty Pillars' Michael Krassner, to provide the ...

Bliss,Sunroof!,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bd5e6ef95969320b93/1:1/w_160/4e11a69a.jpg,2002-02-06 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7586-bliss/,VHF,"Bands like Windy & Carl and Stars of the Lid are on quest for the perfect drone. They are purists, continually honing their craft and chipping away at the excess, going on the assumption that a lean and efficient music machine is better equipped to tune into the Ultimate Vibration. These methods have led both bands toward a polished and pleasant sound, relatively far afield from their coarse four-track beginnings. And there's no doubting the efficacy of this refinement, as Consciousness and The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid were excellent albums that ranked with each band's finest. And then there's Sunroof!. Where other bands see drone as a state of relaxation in which the listener finds himself in harmony with his surroundings, Sunroof! channels the raw, unknowable patterns of nature into a music that's dense, harsh, loud and endless. Miles removed from the soothing hum, these monolithic sound constructions seem hacked from the world of ambient noise with a dull hatchet. They're crude, shapeless, and drooping with stray connective tissue. And yet, in their own way, they're also very beautiful. Before we get into the music on Bliss, a little background. Sunroof! come from a music community seemingly designed with the obsessive music fan in mind. Those looking for an obscure psychedelic noise scene populated by enigmatic characters prone to issuing scores of hyper-limited records to pad a massive and completely unmanageable discography need look no further than the Skullflower. The band was formed in rural England in 1985, and members went on to perform and record in various configurations under the names Ramleh, Consumer Electronics, Ax, Novatron, Ascension, and JFK, and that's just for starters. Sunroof! is the name ex-Skullflower guitarist Mathew Bower now uses for his solo projects (he previously released albums under the name Total). The 2xCD Bliss is actually the second album released by Sunroof! in 2001. The first was the vinyl-only Sad Frog Wind, which featured two side-long compositions full of guitar feedback, synthesizer oscillations, and assorted bells and chimes. It was an impressive record, but Bliss is more diverse, and ultimately, packs a bigger punch. The first two tracks make up one long piece bearing the intriguing title ""Columbine Kisses."" It begins with a half-second of bass rumble and then a cheap, tinny drum machine taps out a wobbly rhythm, seeming somehow feeble and out of place next to the drone. Waves of feedback eventually submerge the rhythm box, and yet it remains barely audible a few leagues below the drone, managing to mark the time amid the relentless noise. Though the track will strike some as difficult listening, Sunroof! brilliantly walks the tightrope between noise and drone music proper; Bliss never comes close to Merzbow territory (upping the overall playability), but always maintains an abrasive edge that keeps the music firmly in the foreground. ""Gold Carnation Legacy"" is one of a few tracks built around the kind of oscillating synth drone that anchored Spacemen 3's epic ""Suicide."" The fluttering tones accelerate and decelerate unpredictably, and woven through the spaces are bowed strings and guitars that sound like whale songs. ""Distoria"" emphasizes percussion and unorthodox guitar technique (one noise might be an electric guitar being sawed in half, another guitar is struck to sound like a series of bells), revealing the strong influence of the Indian raga on Bower's music. ""The Blue Sky of China"" is even more overt in this respect, coaxing the long, winding melody lines of a sitar into a bed of distortion. ""Bells"" is the rare slice of tranquility on the first disc of Bliss, as comparatively tame guitar feedback is sculpted into what could be an aural essay on the healing properties of sunlight. The shorter second disc of Bliss comes a bit closer to evoking its title. ""Dirty Joke from Outer Space"" is a collection of bubbly synth oscillations mixed with bird sounds, and when sheets of feedback ultimately rise in the mix, they're relaxed and welcoming. ""Dance of the Blessed Spirits"" serves to highlight the homespun nature of the Sunroof! project, as the voice of a child near the microphone talks and sings along with the extended tones. This track, like many others throughout Bliss, begins and ends abruptly. While this is probably due to the rudimentary nature of the recording environment, these jarring transitions give the illusion that these pieces actually go on forever, and that the listener just happened to drop in on them for a few minutes. I like to think that somewhere in the world, at this very moment, another Sunroof! drone is raging. And I can only hope there's a tape machine nearby to capture it.","Bands like Windy & Carl and Stars of the Lid are on quest for the perfect drone. They are purists, continually ...

Everynight Fire Works,Hey Mercedes,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0cb13d197565213bacb/1:1/w_160/20c5aad8.jpg,2002-02-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3847-everynight-fire-works/,Vagrant,"If you were in your late teens and lived near Chicago between 1996 and 1999, chances are, you were a Braid fan. Too young to have caught Smashing Pumpkins before they mutated into arena-rock dinosaurs, and too rambunctious to chin-stroke along with McEntire and O'Rourke, the angst-filled masses turned to Braid. You could count on the Champaign foursome to play through the area once every month or two, filling up the Metro or the Fireside Bowl with bobbing heads and squinty rock-out faces. Melodramatic lyrics, Fugazi-esque start/stops, time signature chaos, and an excellent balance of hardcore mentality and catchy melodicism-- what more could a Midwestern eighteen year-old ask for? I know because I was there, pumping my fist to ""First Day Back"" with the rest of you. And that's why I can't decide whether I'm disappointed or just plain angry about the vanilla ice-cream blandness of Everynight Fire Works. See, Hey Mercedes is 75% of what once was Braid-- their answer to ""Saved by the Bell: The College Years,"" if you will. When Braid broke up in early 2000, I took comfort in the fact that three-quarters of the band would continue on under a new moniker, without the services of guitarist/screamy-guy Chris Broach. Their first, self-titled EP was an unimpressive effort, but live shows featured a number of unrecorded songs with potential. Then Hey Mercedes broke from Polyvinyl Records, the home of such respectable Midwesterners as AM/FM and Aloha, for Vagrant Records, the home of critically acclaimed artists like... hmmm... help me out here... Snapcase? Well, anyway, given Vagrant's habit of churning out slick pop-punk product for chain-wallet accessorisors that just came down off a bad Blink-182 bender, the warning flags were raised. And indeed, these warning flags proved accurate upon the release of Everynight Fire Works. Under the increasingly commercial-minded guidance of J. Robbins, every rough edge is polished up to a shimmering, radio-friendly gleam. Close your eyes, and you can imagine most of these songs on MTV, maybe with the band in funny wigs and playing to a house full of underwear-clad teenagers. Still, Robbins helmed the boards on Braid's final and finest full-length, Frame and Canvas, so the blame cannot rest solely with him. Frontman Bob Nanna seems determined to dumb down his songs to reach a wider audience, trading in the polyrhythms and unusual dynamics of old for power chords, power chords, power chords. Sure, there's a few stutter-steps in tracks like ""A-List Actress"" and ""The Frowning of a Lifetime,"" but more common are songs like ""Our Weekend Starts on Wednesday"" and ""What You're Up Against,"" which roll along with little variation in tempo or volume. The one-dimensional nature of the album leads me to say words I never thought I'd utter: I miss Chris Broach. While his contributions to Braid albums often seemed limited to emphatically yelling ""yeah!"" every once in a while, Hey Mercedes is sorely lacking the hard vocal counterpoint Broach would play to Nanna's sensitive guy act. Also absent is the intricate instrumental interplay between Broach and Nanna, as guitarist Mark Dawursk adds little to indicate that Hey Mercedes even needs two six-strings. Frustratingly, a couple songs still manage to strike direct hits on my old Braid-lovin' soul. ""Every Turn"" features the kind of acrobatically catchy vocal Nanna used to specialize in writing, with a great, crunchy chorus tailor-made for the at-home rockout. Album closer ""Let's Go Blue"" layers a tiny little riff over a chugging chord progression, and works well until resorting to that most tired of devices, the bass and drums breakdown. 81.8% of Everynight Fire Works, however, inspires nothing more than a yawn and bittersweet nostalgia. The mediocrity reaches its apex with ""Quit,"" five minutes so lacking in hooks and creativity that it feels ten times as long, even before the textbook false-ending and buildup coda. Of course, it's completely possible that I've just outgrown the target audience for Nanna & Co. Somewhere in Suburbia, I'm guessing there's a fifteen year-old kid just now discovering Hey Mercedes and thinking they're the greatest thing ever. More power to little Ricky-- he could be listening to a lot worse. And maybe my dissatisfaction means I'm actually disappointed and angry with myself, for outgrowing that rockin' inner teenager and becoming a crotchety old foge. No, wait, that's not right. I'm disappointed and angry about Hey Mercedes' impossibly middling debut album. Sorry, don't know what got into me there.","If you were in your late teens and lived near Chicago between 1996 and 1999, chances are, you were a ...

Neon Golden,The Notwist,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43213d197565213bed6/1:1/w_160/c87b09b0.jpg,2002-02-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5845-neon-golden/,City Slang,"I've been considering ways to dole out an introduction to this review for nearly two weeks, each attempt more futile than the last. I considered keeping a diary of listening (and actually went so far as to do it on a number of occasions), piecing together thoughts and hoping something cohesive would come of it. Re-reading my scribbles, I realized that it was like fitting the jumbled pieces of a puzzle together. Every entry referenced something wholly other than what had preceded it. Inevitably, part of it became personal; so I nixed it. Still, the task became a vital part of this, almost as if I had lived inside the sounds of Neon Golden, drifting in and out of song, mixing familiar with unknown, moving above and beneath the textures and never completely keeping time. In the end, it's apt that this resulted from a Notwist record. The last decade for them was full of shifting movements. Beginning in Weilheim, Germany in the early 90s as a heavy metal outfit, Markus and Micha Acher, along with drummer Martin Messerschmid, released two albums filled with pounding drums and guitar solos (The Notwist and Nook) before almost abandoning it completely. However, with Nook, things had already started to change. Interests moved away from thudding power riffs and toward the direction of complex rhythms and structures. Even so, to listen to those albums now, most people would find it difficult to believe the same band made this new disc. In the mid-90s, the Notwist finally got an American distributor with 12, on the now-defunct Zero Hour label. With that, they began to explore even more textures in their sound, enlisting Martin Gretschmann (aka Console) to help with production and add his special electronic touch. Resulting in a more poppy sound for the group (some might even call it indie rock), 12's beauty is startling from beginning to end. With Martin Console now in tow as a full-time member, Shrink was a huge step into the world of electronic music and sounded almost completely unlike anything else made at the time. Mixing rock and pop with free jazz, old-timey folk, jagged minimalist beats and just about anything else you could toss in, I don't have any problems saying now that the record was ahead of its time. To top it off, the shame in it all is that very few took notice; Zero Hour went belly up (rendering 12 and Shrink virtually impossible to find in record shops these days), and the Notwist went back to Germany and sort of disappeared for a few years. So it seemed. Console never really slowed down, releasing a ton of solo projects (one of which was 1999's Matador-released Rocket in the Pocket), remixing just about everyone, and doing the programming and production on possibly the best track from Björk's Vespertine, ""Heirloom."" The list of Notwist side projects became quite lengthy, too: Tied and Tickled Trio (sax player Johannes Enders' continuing project), Village of Savoonga, Potawatomi and Lali Puna, to name a few. So, after four years of what only seemed like hiding, the Acher brothers and the Martins (Console and Messerschmid) return with Neon Golden. Their website says it was worth the wait. And, well, it's true. Neon Golden is replete with textured sounds, drifting (and occasionally driving) pulsations, and mesmerizing hypno-rhythms. It's been quite a while since the last time I actually felt I've been with a record like this. Sounds odd, but that's exactly the feeling I've received over the last two weeks. And when you've got that much time to spend with a record, it becomes an entity in and of itself. Most times with a record review, you get a few precursory listens and then by number five or six, you're spitting out a review. Not so here. With well over fifty listens to this disc, it's like a relationship has begun to spring forth out of the ether. I guess you could say Neon Golden and me have become well acquainted and it's already akin to hanging with an old friend. Given that amount of time, realizations occur. One of my first was that, in many ways, this record is about textures: electronic bleats, pulsing waves, the mixture of organic instruments with digital blips and loops, and most notably the serenity of Markus Acher's voice. While Acher's singing has always been appealing to me, it wasn't until this album that I finally recognized something and, for you lyric analysts, it's probably not a good thing. I've found myself spending more time listening to Acher's voice than paying attention to what exactly he's singing about. In some ways, it's similar to Arto Lindsay. On albums like Mundo Civilizado-- when he's singing in Portuguese, it's unclear exactly what he's talking about. Yet his ability to mesmerize and captivate the listener with his singing can be simply haunting, and damn if his voice just doesn't ooze sex appeal. A very similar thing often occurs when I'm listening to Acher. The songs are sung in English. I know the words and I can sing along. Thing is, my attention becomes devoted to the way his phrases are formed, his ability to roll words off his tongue, the manner in which certain syllables, consonants and vowels are stressed, and the way familiar English words all at once become foreign. On ""This Room,"" there's a moment at around the 1:30 mark where the driving percussion suddenly comes to a delirious halt and leaving only Acher's voice imbedded in a wave of electronic gurgles and throbbing beats. The track is rendered into two halves here, Acher's voice cut-up and pieced back together in a dizzying loop, bouncing off itself in nonsense half-syllables and creating a split-second feel of nausea-inducing vertigo. Elsewhere, a track like ""One Step Inside Doesn't Mean You'll Understand"" is comprised of plucked strings atop a low saxophone moan while hisses and crackles burble just below the surface, waiting for the end of the song, and fading out with the hum of nothing but fuzz, as if the stylus was just caught in a locked groove. Prior to that fading hum, thin layers of sound begin to unfurl themselves, something that transpires on almost every track-- whether it be the distinguishing Notwist banjo, clanking percussion or the layer upon layer of electronics. Even on Neon Golden's most driving track, ""Pilot,"" the band allows space for those resonating electronic hums to break through. And then, another realization. The Notwist have an uncanny knack for allowing their compositions room to breathe, creating lush sonic textures. Dynamic numbers like ""Pilot"" or ""Pick Up the Phone"" come off as thoughtful and unhurried, songs transitioning into each other with languid movements. ""Pick Up the Phone"" is awash in spastic, pointy-headed beats and it sounds like the feel of crumpled and un-crumpled candy wrappers. With Markus Acher singing in what sometimes sound like barely hushed whispers, Neon Golden begins to take on an introspective beauty, almost as if everything (the musicians, the singer, the music) is lost in contemplative thought. Nowhere is this pensiveness more present than in tracks like ""Neon Golden"" or ""Off the Rails."" The muted, tranquil beauty of an acoustic guitar and Markus Acher crooning ""this is all I know"" gently over electronic washes of sound in the latter make for lullaby material. ""Neon Golden,"" on the other hand, begins as a gritty dirge, containing a deep saxophone groan, plucked acoustic guitar and banjo, and the mantra-like title chant. As it progresses, though, the song begins to be taken over by drops of scattered percussion, rhythmic drums, congas, and the murmuring buzz of Console's electronic manipulations. At first, my feelings for ""Consequence"" were ambivalent, but now I see that it's the perfect choice for a closing song. Markus Acher's lovely, plaintive moan of ""Leave me hypnotized, love/ Leave me paralyzed, love,"" is the one time when the lyrics stand against the backdrop of the song, stark and revelatory. Neon Golden can do exactly what he's singing: it leaves you mesmerized, lost in meditative thought and captivated by the grainy, exquisite textures. Neon Golden would be a staggering feat for any band, much less a band most people had long since forgotten about (or maybe never really knew). A decade into their career, the Notwist have created a masterpiece by pulling the same trick they pulled on Shrink: mixing things that might not seem to fit together into a beautiful, seamless whole. Again, the unfortunate thing is that anyone outside Europe is going to have a difficult time getting their hands on a copy. If you do find one, be prepared to pay, as City Slang stuff just ain't that cheap in the USA. So, why haven't labels like Mute or Communion or Darla jumped on getting this available for domestic distribution yet? A more obvious choice would even be Matador, who recently released one of Console's albums domestically. As of right now, the Notwist have released the record of the year. It's a shame that most people might not have a chance to hear it.","I've been considering ways to dole out an introduction to this review for nearly\n\ two weeks, each attempt ...

Touched,Ken Stringfellow,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21ab1335d7bf1698405/1:1/w_160/0feb3fd9.gif,2002-02-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7535-touched/,Manifesto,"Ken Stringfellow is something like power-pop royalty. Not only is he a great songwriter, responsible for half of the music of the Posies, but he's also kept his plate constantly full over the last decade, working with everyone from REM to Big Star to Scott McCaughey to Ringo Starr. The Posies are the hardest working defunct band in show business-- Stringfellow and fellow Posie John Auer have released more material since the band's breakup than most bands release in an entire career. And in the midst of all this, Ken found time to start yet another band-- a group called Saltline that only managed to record one EP before splitting. This left Stringfellow with a bunch of songs just lying around doing nothing. So, he penned up a few more and put them all to work on his second solo album, Touched. True to form, it's not a bad batch of tunes. Stringfellow allows the country tendencies that have always lurked in his songwriting to come to the fore on the opener ""Down Like Me."" Ron Preston's steel guitar swells in and out of the mix and drummer Eric Marshall keeps things moving at a quick clip as Stringfellow serves up one of the sticky melodies we've by now come to expect from him. Mitch Easter's production is clean and uncluttered, but it sometimes lacks the punch of the Posies' best efforts, like 1993's excellent Frosting on the Beater. ""This One's on You"" pulls back the reins and turns back the clock to roughly the time when Bernie Leadon was still in the Eagles. One of the Posies' main strengths was always the harmonies of Auer and Stringfellow. Here, minus Auer, Stringfellow simply layers his own voice and while this works well enough, there's a certain balance that Auer's voice brought to the harmonies of the Posies that's lacking on Touched. On his own, Stringfellow's voice also has a somewhat alarming tendency to sound like Timothy B. Schmidt on the high notes, but this only happens rarely. Stringfellow naturally includes a few of the power-pop gems that he does so well, like the Sloan-esque ""Find Yourself Alone."" At first glance, the song is catchy and well-performed, with a monster chorus, but a closer listen reveals several piano and Rhodes tracks filling out the background, adding immensely to the overall texture of the song. If only there were radio stations somewhere that would play this stuff. ""Uniforms"" begins over a bed of cello and violin, but quickly segues into loping pop full of cleanly strummed guitars, harpsichord, and even a bit of distant clip-clop percussion nicked straight from Pet Sounds. Atmospheric synths gradually enter the mix, only to give way to a piano interlude that lays the groundwork for the last few verses. The rhythm pushes forward harder than before, and layers of synth wash underneath Stringfellow's multi-tracked voice. It's an impressive little opus that uses a keen sense of arrangement to its fullest advantage. ""Sparrow"" is the best of an impressive quartet of classic power-pop songs with one of the album's finest melodies topping another inventive arrangement. Stringfellow makes use of his lowest range in the pre-chorus over fuzzed-out guitars and organs, and offers some impressive guitar and keyboard work in the instrumental bridge. The Hammond-soaked ""Reveal Love"" comes down a notch, eschewing guitar entirely in the verses, but still offering a massive chorus designed to rattle around your head for days afterward. But while the more upbeat numbers on Touched are uniformly flawless, things get spotty when Stringfellow departs from that route. ""One Morning"" is a fine enough acoustic song, full of nicely layered vocals and a great melody, but it's followed by ""Spanish Waltz,"" a song that feels somewhat labored. It veers between some forced distorted passages and vaguely psychedelic sections with odd little guitar parts battling with Stringfellow's otherwise good vocal melody. There's a bombast to the song that's simply unbecoming a songwriter like Stringfellow, whose primary strength is melody. It's followed by ""Fireflies,"" a quiet, pensive song where the guitar and drums are actually more prominent than the vocals. It works well as a mood piece or interlude, but little else. But it's on ""The Lover's Hymn"" where he really veers off course. The aforementioned Timothy B. Schmidt resemblance hinted at earlier is in a full bloom here, and the song practically sounds like an outtake from the sessions for ""The Long Run."" At more than five minutes, it's extremely overlong, and never really develops itself beyond the organ-coated verses, with the exception of some somewhat interesting instrumental bits presented in lieu of a chorus. Thankfully, Stringfellow gets his bearings again for the closer, ""Here's to the Future,"" and ending Touched in the same territory that Big Star's third album occupied 25 years ago. What begins as an acoustic song is shrouded in a blanket of analog synthesizer during the crescendos between verses, and Marshall punctuates it with orchestral percussion. It's a fitting close to a fine solo effort that's not afraid to take a few chances. No one really knows at this point what will become of the Posies, but as long as Stringfellow keeps putting out music in some form, the future of power-pop looks okay.","Ken Stringfellow is something like power-pop royalty.

Asleep in the Back,Elbow,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc26ea9e61561daa73ee/1:1/w_160/eb3dbf3f.jpg,2002-02-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2718-asleep-in-the-back/,V2,"Bandnames are important. The best ones are good indicators of where a band is coming from and what they're trying to achieve. Or at the very least, they sound good and work with the band's sound. Unfortunately, not all bands can seem to find that one moniker that's perfect for them, and a lot of them end up settling for some word that was lying around not being used for much else. Take Elbow, for instance. That's a bleeding awful name for a band. It doesn't even lend itself to much of a backstory. What do you say to the interviewer when he asks how you chose your name? ""Oh, well, we always wanted to name the band for the bony joint where the upper arm meets the forearm."" Even the various idioms the word appears in-- elbow room, elbow grease-- can't help it out. And then there's the questions it raises. What does this band called Elbow sound like? What made them call themselves Elbow? Are they good? They don't sound very cool. Well, friends, it's my good fortune to report to you that the band's music is a lot better than their name. The English quintet open their debut at a medium tempo with ""Any Day Now,"" a song that immediately highlights a few of their strengths, and also hints at a few of their weaknesses. Drummer Jupp (who apparently has just the one name) lays down a slightly fractured, snare-heavy beat accompanied by a modicum of subtle programming and Pete Turner's dub-influenced bass. Lead vocalist Guy Garvey seems to have his voice on loan from Peter Gabriel, though he keeps his delivery hushed and rather low-key. The entire band harmonizes impressively with him on the choruses, making for a dense texture, especially when combined with Craig Potter's organ lines. Garvey's Gabriel resemblance gradually melts away as the rest of the album unfolds, though he occasionally returns to it when he goes for the big held notes that punctuate the climaxes of songs like ""Can't Stop"" and the excellent closer ""Scattered Black and Whites."" ""Red"" also retains some of Gabriel's influence, with its deceptively complex drum and percussion parts and heaving cello. Garvey's refrain of ""this can't go on"" is one of the album's best melodic moments. As the song's mix dismantles itself at the conclusion, the main elements exit first, leaving behind a heavily delayed and tremoloed guitar part that you hardly even noticed was there during the song. Mark Potter dumps delay-drenched guitars all over a creeping programmed drumbeat on ""Little Beast,"" which finds Garvey sitting a little further from the front of the mix, instead subsumed by the atmospheric music created by his bandmates. It takes a bit too long to get to the next song, though, and the track isn't really interesting enough to warrant all of its four minutes. By the time ""Powder Blue"" finally does roll around, Asleep in the Back's biggest flaw starts to come into focus. The song is actually pretty good taken on its own, with Garvey hitting a good falsetto on the refrain and the boys providing him with some fine backing vocals, but the entire album falls within a very narrow, and very slow tempo range. ""Powder Blue"" works well in that range, with its floating piano ostinatos and light spattering of sax, but these guys really need a fast song to insert somewhere in the running order for the sake of diversity. The closest they come is ""Bitten by the Tailfly,"" another strong track. It's not exactly fast, but its feel is considerably different from what surrounds it. Mark Potter's guitar kicks up actual dust for the first time on the album, and the faux-tribal beats and curiously tense verses lend the song a sort of neurotic pulse that draws you in. The dynamic shifts between the verses and Potter's deafening guitar interjections are almost enough to keep it interesting on their own, but thankfully, the whole song proves engaging. The band is always discriminating with their arrangements, occasionally utilizing analog synths to color in the edges of a passage, and using extra musicians to fill in the texture where it's obvious that the band's own instruments wouldn't quite be enough. The best example of this is the woodwind quintet that shows up on the record's title cut. At first, the cor anglais and clarinet enter with long, held notes, almost blending with the organ, but by the song's end, the whole quintet has joined, offering up countermelodies and some needed timbrel variety. While the band has a very developed sense of texture and sound, though, they rather desperately need to work on changing things up a bit more with regard to the songs themselves. As I said before, the whole album comes in at roughly the same tempo. And though they're able to make a seven-minute epic like ""Newborn"" interesting all the way through by shifting the texture almost constantly, simply shifting textures a lot doesn't offer the kind of variety I need to sustain me over the course an entire album. Elbow have managed to craft a skilled and laudable debut. Asleep in the Back finds them starting their recording career (they've been a live unit for almost ten years now) at a level a lot of bands don't even reach on their third or fourth albums. If they manage to harness their strengths and inject just a bit more variety into the mix, I have a feeling a second album from Elbow could really deliver.","Bandnames are important.

Dabbling with Gravity and Who You Are,Vibracathedral Orchestra,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9555e6ef959693213d1/1:1/w_160/9dac76e5.jpg,2002-02-05 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8465-dabbling-with-gravity-and-who-you-are/,VHF,"Trying to describe this stuff can be, well, trying. I don't have much problem with the sounds-- some tambourine here, sitar or some such Eastern droner there-- but the general feeling is what's hard to translate. Descriptors like ""trance"" or ""drone"" don't really do Vibracathedral Orchestra justice, not only because they carry too much baggage to really be useful, but also because they're too simple. I cannot go into trance from most of this music; it's far too boisterous. I hear drones in the mix, but also about a hundred other things. Furthermore, there's the issue over whether or not communal, cathartic improvisation is something that can ever be translated. What may seem transcendent in the moment could very well be unintelligible in the next (that is, if true transcendence could actually be communicated). Of course, anything recorded could probably be classified as music today, but there really isn't a working definition for the relationship between music and audience, specifically regarding the ""intent"" of the composers and resulting receipt of their message. Leeds, England's Vibracathedral Orchestra (or VCO) may not give the message their audience takes from the music much thought. Rather, as Dabbling with Gravity and Who You Are was made from several sessions of group improvisation in multi-instrumentalist Michael Flower's kitchen, recorded directly to two-track, there may not have been much time for big concepts, or even little ones. Another member, Bridget Hayden, offers more insight into their intent: ""There is no chord formation that can be planned which creates elation or sadness, or any art which is profound enough to change anything fundamental about a person. There is just a resonance around us which musicians/artists are using or not using."" So, what's left is continuous, non-resolved (or ever-resolved, depending on your point of view) ""trance""/""drone"" music, though those terms still seem a bit off the mark. The album begins with ""Hypnotism of Yr Hips,"" and from the get-go it's clear that lulling you to sleep with smooth beats and ambient hissing will not be VCO's game. In fact, much of their music appears to work best for jumping and flailing like a Cro-Magnon man celebrating the New Moon. The repetitive rhythms seem influenced by Indian ragas (though maybe that's only because I can hear tablas, tambouras and plenty of tambourine) while a constant phased guitar pumps a fair amount of ""noise"" into the arrangement. The song lasts about four minutes, and segues without a break into ""Let Steam Rule and Luck Lose."" Here, the guitar plays recognizable strumming figures, and sometimes even lines resembling melodies. Up to this point, VCO has remained on the same chord throughout the record, and they'll continue to do so. Occasionally, cymbals crash, while other times the tide ebbs into softer regions. ""He Play All Day Long"" distinguishes itself from the mass of sound by toning down the ambience, introducing acoustic guitar warmth, accompanied by sitar-like drone. Again, the major chord from the beginning is held, though you'd be surprised at the textural variations they get from one tonality. For me, this is a highlight, though I wouldn't blame you if you missed it somehow. ""Fingernail R 'n' B"" removes most of the clutter to reveal quite standard (to my ears) Indian mystic drones, like what you might hear in a Delhi mountaintop mosque at sunrise. And just to show you that they have a sense of dynamics (extended as they may be), VCO kicks out the jams on the epic ""The Body Is the Arrow, The Arms Form the Bow."" Lo-fi, Eastern minimalist terror abounds, as a tambourine hacks away in the distance, cutting through layers of odd strings, low, oddly tuned strings, Byzantine and who knows what other cultures' lutes, and a whole array of exotic percussion. There are flutes, too. Oh, the flutes. There aren't many bands that play this kind of music-- that is, with CDs for sale. The first incarnation of Amon Düül comes to mind, but VCO is louder (and drastically more musically competent) than they were. Colorado's Biota shares similarities with VCO, but is nearer the avant-garde end of the art-trance spectrum. There aren't many bad things to say about Dabbling with Gravity, other than I probably won't play it everyday. It's not that I find it offensive, or even boring (which is a feat for ""trance"" music), but rather, droning just isn't an everyday thing for me. If it is for you, VCO offer some interesting translations.","Trying to describe this stuff can be, well, trying. I don't have much problem\n\ with the sounds-- some ...

Encounters,Sofa Surfers,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49bc0084474cd0c0519/1:1/w_160/d595c4e1.jpg,2002-02-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7310-encounters/,Klein,"In the laptop world, it's a tough gig to make convincing dub music. As the exemplary reissue label Blood and Fire demonstrates with their every release, dub is all about the clash of human creativity and technological ineptitude. King Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry were pioneers because they overcame the gulf between their imaginations and the thrift-store sound equipment they had access to. Thus, Tubby relied on the beloved primitive sound effects of accidental tape-hiss and drop-outs as much he relied on the echo chamber. Very few present-day digi-dubbers resist the temptation to defuzz and cleanse their rootical offerings. Like Ryan Moore's Twilight Circus Dub Sound System and Oswald von Moritz's Rhythm and Sound project, the Austrian quartet Sofa Surfers relish and emulate the mystical lo-fi glamour of classic dub. But unlike Moore and von Moritz, Sofa Surfers are not mere copyists. Cargo, the band's unnerving and astounding debut album, plotted a course from Crooklyn dub (""Container"") and Ital wisdom (""Sweat"") to Massive Attack-ish future-funk trip-hop (""The Low Rider"") and avant-metal Rastafarian hip-hop (""Beans and Rice""). The remix album, Constructions, magnified Cargo's oppressive hydroponic power with dubs and reworkings by such sun-shy, sunken-cheeked masters of the out-there, slo-mo roller as Spectre, Mad Professor, Howie B and Eardrum. Encounters is no doubt intended as a continuation of the collaborative aesthetic of Constructions. Yet, despite Sofa Surfers' valiant attempts, the record suffers occasionally from thread-bare talent having a shoddy go at underground hip-hop or slouchy lounge ballads. In such cases, Sofa Surfers relegate themselves to providing moody soundscapes for their guests to faff around in. However, when they encounter true talent, the quartet approaches the essential toughness of Cargo. This record opens with ""Formula,"" featuring would-be macker Sensational and his claims about being the ""real deal"" and ""too much for ya."" Sensational rides a crisp drum-track similar to Cargo's ""Container"" and Axelrod-y breaks that DJ Shadow and other crate-diggers have been appropriating for years. The thesaurus-plundering wordplay continues with Oddateee's ""21st Century Army."" Oddateee's message is the standard vision of a Blade Runner future. But despite the Corporation's oppression of masses, Oddateee lives up to his nom de guerre by proclaiming himself an oddity who's as ""large as an aircraft carrier."" Wow. What a flat simile. Oddateee isn't exactly in Saul Williams' league. ""River Blues,"" features the droopy, drawled vocal talent of Jeb Loy Nichols. The cut previously made an appearance on Sincerely Yours, Klein Records' most recent label compilation, but failed to shine much amongst all that disc's fluff. Here, in its true context, it is, unsurprisingly, not much better. But at least the scratchadelic bridge makes some sort of sense after Sensational's and Oddateee's raps. Still, the Surfers only exert themselves about as much as Nicols, losing steam after drudging up a heap of worn-out-groove fuzz-hiss. It takes the dancehall chat of DJ Collage and ""Babylon Tymes"" to get things bouncing out of complaisance. While Collage doesn't have the gruff fury of Elephant Man or the righteous zeal of Sizzla, his Babylon-vexing patter spurs Sofa Surfers into laying down a feisty echo-abundant roller. Then comes the avant-garde illbience of ""Twisted Tongue,"" serving as a nice transition between the routine of the disc's first half to the more adventurous and successful second. Featuring the dynamic duo of Techno Animal and 2nd Gen collaborator Dälek, ""Elusive Scripts"" bucks as ""Formula"" should have. Dälek doesn't have to fake like Sensational. He's a thoroughly credible MC who doesn't rely on dopey bragging rhymes to proclaim his greatness-- he shows rather than tells. With ""See the Light,"" Junior Delgado makes an irrefutable case for him to take over Horace Andy's position in Massive Attack. With talent like Delgado, Sofa Surfers have to come up with something special. Using Massive Attack's crawling version of John Holt's ""Man Next Door"" as a model, ""See the Light"" is unmistakably this album's standout cut. Dawna Lee comes on like a super-sultry Dawn Penn, thus making ""Witness"" a knock-out gorgeous R&B; ballad. But in direct opposition to the beauty of ""Witness,"" the collaboration with ex-Pop Group member and On U Sound System affiliate Mark Stewart, ""Home Truth,"" is a hamfisted industrial dub rocker. Stewart, it seems, is never going to achieve the distinction of his 1990 electro-dub masterpiece Metatron, and Sofa Surfers don't appear too keen on helping him better himself. Encounters ends quite unexpectedly with the skipping, skuzzed-up marimba jaunt ""Gamelan,"" which recalls the ingenious playfulness Klein Records' star artist, Seelenluft. It's almost as though Seelenluft is an uncredited guest here. ""Gamelan"" makes the inescapable point that Sofa Surfers don't really need guests and collaborators to make unique and engaging music. In fact, Encounters proves that, more often than not, the guests prevent the band from stretching themselves, and hinder them from matching or exceeding their remarkable Cargo and Constructions. Go it alone next time, boys.","In the laptop world, it's a tough gig to make convincing dub music. As the\n\ exemplary reissue label ...

"Over the Edge, Vol. 4: Dick Vaughn's Moribund Music of the 70s",Negativland,by: David M.

You don't tug on Superman's cape. You don't spit into the wind. You don't pull the mask off that ol' Lone Ranger, and you don't mess around with freeform radio. After all, freeform radio-- real, no-rules, no-boundaries freeform radio-- is about as common in playlisted corporate America as a trustworthy politician. So, on June 11th, 1984, when listeners tuned into ""Over the Edge,"" the weekly freeform show hosted by so-called ""sonic outlaws"" and collage artists supreme Negativland only to hear 70s schmaltz standbys like ""Billy, Don't Be a Hero"" and ""Rock Me Gently,"" it's understandable why they might be upset. Though they may be better known for their studio releases and legal battles, Negativland's probably spent more time over the last two decades at a small California freeform station than they have in any studio or courtroom. Their shows are as unpredictable as they come; long mixes full of chopped-up pop culture, oddball characters, weird pranks and audience participation (callers to the station are generally placed immediately on the air and allowed to interact however they please, so long as they don't say the forbidden word: ""Hello""). A few such moments are included in this package. In a segment called ""Ringo Starr is Dead,"" the group tells their audience that Starr has died of a drug overdose and feigns a tribute, chopping up and destroying Beatles music while callers grieve, express doubt, and eventually curse them as their hoax comes unraveled. But on that fateful day in June, something went wrong. All anyone really knew for certain was that some asshole by the name of Dick Vaughn had taken over Negativland's time slot, and where previously they had tuned in for hours of chaotic unpredictable sound experiments, now there was only ""Muskrat Love."" What many listeners didn't realize was that Dick Vaughn was little more than a creation of Negativland, the latest in a long line of characters. Why did no one suspect that Dick was the work of these well-known pranksters? Most probably did. But lots of people bought into it. And the angry phone calls preserved in this, a new, expanded two-disc reissue of one of Negativland's finest ""Over the Edge"" releases, live on as proof. Other Negativland creations stop by for moments of delightful radio trickery, too, including visits from longtime staples like the irrepressibly irate homosexual Weatherman, nasally cultural reviewer Crosley Bendix, and the gluttonous Dean of Psychiatric Broadcasting, Dr. Oslo Norway. But the real focus here is Dick-- probably among the least beloved of any of Negativland's characters-- an ambitious-yet-tasteless radio personality and incurable phone prankster. The first disc of this release presents moments from ""California Superstation,"" Dick's first misguided attempt at radio, wherein he plays a bunch of vapid, irritating games with the audience and manages to irritate an entire listening base in a mere five hours. Also included is an assortment of Dick Vaughn's phone pranks. Apparently not content with destroying his own radio shows, Dick was notorious for calling up other, real radio shows, and wrecking havoc on the air. Disc Two documents ""Moribund Music of the 70s""-- purportedly the first-ever 70s nostalgia radio show-- hosted by Vaughn in 1984, splicing vocal segments of Dick's show with various listener phonecalls (both hateful and praising) and assorted strange noises. These clips are interspersed with recordings of off-air phone surveys, where one member of the group asks unsuspecting listeners what they think of Vaughn's show while the rest of the group constantly interrupts the conversation with a barrage of mostly vulgar soundbytes (which, of course, everyone but the baffled survey-taker fails to notice). I enjoyed these moments thoroughly, but then, I might be biased. To the non-Negativland-obsessed, pranks like these, while certainly fun, might eventually get a little old. Without the thrill of listening to such shenanigans live, they do lose some of their spark and vitality. And as with any comedy album, what's funny the first time around may not sit so well on repeated listens. Still, the compilation works as a history lesson and it makes what comes next that much more amazing. The last quarter of this 150+ minute-long collection is dedicated to Dick's death (in a fiery plane crash, no less) and his subsequent postmortem appearances (which include a dying plea captured on the flight recorded, and tapes prepared in case of untimely death). Negativland pays homage to the recently deceased in a segment called ""Dick is Dead,"" a truly bizarre collage which is equal parts minced 70s cheese, black box recordings from plummeting planes, strange characters, crying babies and funky basslines. Ultimately, this set is not unlike the rest of Negativland's ""Over the Edge"" collections. Without a doubt, it contains moments of sheer brilliance, but there's so much material to wade through that it might as well come with a sticker that says ""For True Obsessives Only."" Fans of the group's antics will inevitably eat this up, but for those just coming to the table for the first time, one of the group's more proper studio-bound efforts might serve as a better appetizer (for what it's worth, Escape from Noise and the now out-of-print U2 are the classics, though A Big 10-8 Place is my personal favorite). Of course, for a certain crowd-- those who, like myself, believe radio can be something more than the record industry's favorite whore-- there's a certain magic to Dick Vaughn. Even in its less-than-stellar moments, Moribund Music of the 70s is still oddly fascinating. There's always a certain risk inherent-- a feeling that not only is it possible that everything might go wrong live on the air, but that it's likely, too-- that puts these recordings on a plane far removed from most anything else going out over the airwaves these days. For those who still believe that art can be dangerous, that there's still a place in this world for true no-holds-barred freeform radio, Negativland continue to reign both as innovators and as inspirations.","In our jaded, cynical time, few things are sacred.

Unfortunately, the infinitely confounding nature of quality has made the process of defining it a long and fruitless one. In short: what the hell is quality? We know from previous excursions that a teacher grading written tests has to employ his conception of quality in order to differentiate between an extremely good essay and one that's relatively mediocre. Of course, there's always the collegiate preoccupation with correct spelling, correct punctuation, etc., but once semantic-correctness is out of the way, the only thing that earmarks a truly good paper is the quality of the work therein. So what is this quality comprised of? Talent? Well, talent is occasionally a symptomatic characteristic, but to assume that the two go hand in hand completely ignores the ""DJ Zeph Principle."" This is a hard law to explain so I'll refer you to a recent Socratic dialectic I had with one of my students: Student: Hey, Prof! I just dropped by to tell you that that DJ Zeph shit you played during class wasn't too shabby. Why'd you come down so hard on the guy? He's not really a bad musician! Pirsig: I see you didn't get the point of the lesson. How's a little private tutoring sound? [Disc begins] Pirsig: Alright, notice how this first song, ""Percussion Discussion,"" draws so heavily from world beat. The marimbas and tablas are reminiscent of the seductive rhythms of Laika's Silver Apples of the Moon (albeit, awkwardly handled). Too unwieldy for less-sensitive male hands, it seems. The flourishes of guitar and live sitar are nice enough, but rather than creating a truly interesting dynamic, they merely pad out the track. Nothing horrible, but nothing to really pique your interest yet. Student: But man, that's totally one of the best tracks on the album! Pirsig: My point exactly. ""Percussion Discussion"" finds Zeph barely dipping his toe into foreign waters before rushing back to the patio to drape himself in urban America, circa 1982. This is old-school, pastiche hip-hop, right down to the James Brown samples. There's even a battle-rap anthem, boasting the unsubtle title ""Rubber and Glue,"" which features underground ne'er-do-well Azeem spreading the good word about his sneakers. But ultimately, Zeph never enters the creative stratum of his influences, which sounds to be Grandmaster Flash b-sides. His scratching is pretty solid, but it's a technique with limited variation. Student: But man, that takes talent! Pirsig: Well, Eddie Van Halen is a pretty talented guitarist, but how often do you listen to OU812? Student: Dude, I'm so disillusioned... As you can see, the subject (one DJ Zeph) has enough talent to draw comparisons to his musical heroes but fails to invoke the same sense of excitement those same artists did twenty-years ago when their sound was considered ""ground-breaking."" Thusly, a talented individual doesn't necessitate a quality product. Obviously, this situation could be easily remedied. Can you guess which aspect of the Pirsig Equation for Artistry\xAE Zeph is lacking? Talent + Innovation = Quality","Ph\xE6drus's Conducive Guide to Quality, Chapter 26: Quality vs. Talent

Eban and Charley,Stephin Merritt,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43c13d197565213beec/1:1/w_160/72fb73fe.gif,2002-02-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5238-eban-and-charley/,Merge,"Generally speaking, collaboration is a good thing. When musicians share ideas, not only do they get to take advantage of the very best that each of them has to offer, but the added perspective generally prevents them from falling into blind, self-obsessed egotism. Generally speaking, Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields, the Gothic Archies, and the Future Bible Heroes, is one of those rare, wonderful musicians who's at his best when he's unapologetically being himself. But it wasn't until the release of the brilliantly executed 69 Love Songs, on which Merritt opened himself up to the contributions of his touring band and guest vocalists, that his unique musical vision was fully realized. And Merritt is, without question, a true original-- a character falling somewhere between Cole Porter and Droopy who's as likely to cite ABBA as a musical influence as he is to bring up Harry Partch. Over the course of his career, Merritt has proven that he's one of the most adept, versatile songwriters working today, capable of cranking out synth-pop gems and downcast piano ballads alike, all dripping with a unique kind of theatrical, semi-satirical melancholy. While many artists struggle to create something that buries its influences under the guise of innovation, Merritt's strength has always rested partially in the limits he imposes on himself. While trying to incorporate such a wide range of influences could result in an utter mess, trying to incorporate these influences into, say, a three-minute pop song with a ukulele yields much more contained, interesting results. This, the soundtrack to the independent film Eban and Charley, is the first thing to be recorded by Merritt under his birthname. And appropriately, it's in some ways the loosest, most unfiltered thing Merritt has ever recorded. Working outside of the framework of the pop song, Merritt is left to explore more exotic sound sources and song structures. Unfortunately, without that framework, these elements often fail to amount to anything significant, providing somewhat interesting, meandering background music, but little more. Eban and Charley's 40-second, piano-only introductory piece, ""Mother,"" seems promising enough. Simple, stark, and vaguely melodic, the greatest strength of ""Mother"" lies in its brevity. Sadly, the same can't be said for the plodding ""Cricket Problem,"" a sound collage of bicycles, slurping straws, and music box chimes that fails both as a proper song and as an abstract piece of mechanical music. Things pick up with ""Some Summer Day,"" one of the few songs on Eban and Charley to play host to Merritt's haunting baritone. Whimsical and melancholy without being too heavy-handed, the track is a lovely, albeit brief, glimpse of Merritt doing what he does best. Still, the album's finest moments don't come until ""Poppyland"" and ""Maria Maria Maria,"" the most fully developed songs on the record, and two songs that could easily hold their own against the Magnetic Fields' better work. The former harkens back to Merritt's older work, with a charming drum machine beat and bubbly synthesizers. ""Maria Maria Maria"" is simply gorgeous-- a dark, reverb-soaked slab of despondency with a lyrical combination of absurdism and sincerity that could only have come from Merritt. But elsewhere, the musical accompaniment for Eban and Charley can't seem to figure out exactly what it wants to do with itself. Tracks like ""Titles"" consist of little more than arranged mechanical noises that don't benefit from the kind of grand conceptualism that made composers like Ligeti's mechanical music so fascinating. For fans harboring high expectations for Merritt's work, Eban and Charley is more than a little bittersweet. Its high points are Merritt at his best, but substantial portions of it seem somewhat like aimless background music. Collaboration is indeed good thing, but the general unevenness of this record suggests that Merritt does his best work when the parameters of his music are established by his own mind, not an independent film.","Generally speaking, collaboration is a good thing.

Family of Forces,Single Unit,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41cea9e61561daa4e19/1:1/w_160/4cbf8a18.jpg,2002-02-04 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7185-family-of-forces/,Jester,"Norway's Are Mokkelbost plays the real dark stuff. He draws the strange, intricate, scary pictures, and I can only imagine that he dreams of dank pits and Lovecraftian orcs. His CPU is probably filling in a lot of the details, because most folks simply don't have the threshold for goth to withstand such hopelessly downward spiraling expression. And while I have no insight into this guy's personal life, it's probably a safe bet to say he's a got a shelf-load of spell books and ghost stories with which to inspire a gross manner of midnight brainstorming sessions and shameful graveyard confessionals. But then again, that's pretty unlikely. It could just be that Mokkelbost (recording here as Single Unit) has a knack for nipping the sounds of the apocalypse in the bud. Certainly, he knows a thing or two about the technique, taking fairly straight-ahead industrial algorithms (Reznor may be a reference, but something tells me he doesn't want to fuck you like an animal so much as merely puncture your eardrums) and spicing up the mix/remix with your workaday thrash guitar and avant-progressive dynamics. And this is something he excels at. Whether or not I follow his steps into the black forest mostly depends on my mood, because it doesn't appear he's likely to change his tune anytime soon. Chiefly, if you want the real spooky stuff, Single Unit has you covered. Likewise, if you just want a little sour to spoil your sweet life, Mokkelbost can help you out. Otherwise, fall in line to get pummeled (and I suggest leaving the bathroom lights on if dark isn't your thing). Single Unit's debut full-length, Family of Forces, begins with the very brief (and prophetic) ""Moving Caves, Enter Abstract."" Distant siren-y sounds close in like a spaceship landing, and soon enough, the aggro-guitar pounces down center stage, like a bull in a maternity ward. The percussion matches the crunch strike-for-strike, and the only things that don't remind me of an electronic Zeni Geva are the tinkerbells entering at suitably inappropriate moments. ""5th Cumming"" (hopefully accidental pun notwithstanding), is a rather nice blueprint for most of the rest of the album. There's a pseudo-repeating figure wherein Mokkelbost's big guitar lays down the distortion and drang while drum machines pound out death metal beats and red alarm synths play like the 80s were only ever supposed to be good for Mad Max and eminent nuclear war. Maybe paranoia is a good adjective for this album, because I keep having the feeling things are about to take a turn for the worse, as each layer of noise and programmed chaos gets tossed onto the heap. At just over five minutes, this is one of the longest tunes on the album, and it feels like a week. ""P, P&P; Intro"" and ""Passion Pirates and Parasites"" are something of a mini-epic, and they do make use of dynamics and something like pacing (though it's brisk whenever possible). The former begins like an anthem for desensitization, with persistently discordant keyboard mashing, and what sounds like a manic church organ. This is juxtaposed with brief sections of calm, as if this is a tale of two different worlds (and much of this album could be described as cinematic, even if future shock and gore is the theatre du jour). The latter tune feels very much like a hard prog tune, but played on the beloved sequencers and scarred Strat rather than with a bunch of ex-conservatory subversives named Jarno and Helmut. Again, there's a feel here of doom and heavy combat, and the actual playing is never less than inhumanly precise, so if you need a breather (or even just a volume adjustment), please feel free. The minority mode on Family of Forces is carnivalesque, and I'm of course not referring to happy clowns and cotton candy. Houses of mirrors are more likely the domains of tunes like ""Fluktrute"" and ""Orgel Alene,"" both of which emphasize devilish whimsy over sheer sonic bombardment. Some of this might conceivably be mistaken for a recent Danny Elfman soundtrack, if only he hung out with Darren Aronofsky more than Tim Burton. Post-modern creaking door music? I won't go that far. Almost inevitably, this kind of record makes me a tad numb after a while. Without creeping into Mokkelbost's psyche, I couldn't tell you if that was the plan all along, though with as much detail as went into the rhythm tracks alone, I doubt it. The only downfall with making music for the end of civilization is that you run the risk of alienating your relatively civil listeners. Don't get me wrong-- I'm all for a good digital maelstrom. But if I take a short intermission, please understand.","Norway's Are Mokkelbost plays the real dark stuff. He draws the strange, intricate, scary pictures, and I can only ...

The Best of Phil Ochs: 20th Century Masters,Phil Ochs,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99dc0084474cd0c2655/1:1/w_160/46b13b50.jpg,2002-02-04 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5940-the-best-of-phil-ochs-20th-century-masters/,A&M,"""You're not a folk singer,"" Bob Dylan accused Phil Ochs, ""you're a journalist."" He echoed the most consistent criticism of the late Phil Ochs, who made his name with topical folk songs. Ochs churned out political lyrics, taking ideas from the news and from first-hand experience with the turmoil of the 1960s: a coal miners' strike in Kentucky, the fight for civil rights in Mississippi, and anti-war rallies, some of which he helped organize. His sharp lyrics and refusal to compromise combined with an easy humor and winning personality to make him one of the great protest singers. But Ochs was also ambitious. He'd watched his peers cross over to stardom: Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, and his friend from Greenwich Village, Dylan. By the mid-sixties, Ochs was afraid he'd be left behind. This new ""best of"" collection gathers twelve songs from Ochs' last four studio albums. He'd switched labels, from Elektra to A&M;, and began to write complicated pop songs that moved away from the news. But he still didn't hit it big, and as he stagnated professionally, Nixon's election and the continuing Vietnam War wore him down. The frustration and depression that permeate these songs make this a grim record of the end of his career. The Best of Phil Ochs: 20th Century Masters begins with over half of the songs from Ochs' 1967 masterpiece, Pleasures of the Harbor. Ochs had been listening to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's, and was aiming for something just as big. Ditching strict topical songs, he explored the state of the nation in lyrics about cocktail parties, elderly flower ladies, and sailors back from sea. He left his guitar behind and brought in one of Liza Minnelli's arrangers, Ian Freebairn-Smith, to write orchestration. Pleasures of the Harbor actually sounds conservative for its time. Ochs still wrote lyrics like a journalist: his florid descriptions still took in detailed scenes and translated them to song. The music borrowed old-fashioned styles-- for example, the swelling strings on ""Pleasures of the Harbor,"" the neoclassical ""Flower Lady,"" and the ragtime piano on ""Outside of a Small Circle of Friends."" But Pleasures of the Harbor was a masterful pop album. Ochs' voice is limited-- with his narrow range and slight twang, he was no Tony Bennett-- but it's stark against the baroque arrangements, and the sincerity makes songs like ""Flower Lady"" honestly beautiful. ""Cross My Heart"" starts as a dainty pop song, but Ochs' words make it compelling-- the despair and hopelessness of the verses, and the conviction with which he turns it around in the chorus. ""Outside of a Small Circle of Friends,"" a satire of liberal apathy and laziness set to a ragtime tune, surpasses even ""Draft Dodger Rag"" as Ochs' most scathingly humorous song. On the other hand, ""The Crucifixion"" was inspired by the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and it asks what drives society to kill its best and youngest leaders. It's the pinnacle of Ochs' songwriting, though its music is a bit awkward: Ochs hired experimental musician Joseph Byrd to arrange it with disturbing strings and bizarre electronic sounds, with mixed results. Many people-- eventually including Ochs himself-- regretted the weird mess that Byrd made of the arrangement, but it's strangely appropriate to the theme: when I first listened to this years ago, it was the scariest thing I'd ever heard. Pleasures of the Harbor proved the breadth of Ochs' talent, but it didn't help him commercially. It outsold his earlier albums but only reached #168 on the Billboard charts. Unfortunately, this was Ochs' creative and commercial peak. On his next three albums, he adjusted the formula by stripping down the instrumentation and bringing back explicit political lyrics. He never found a combination that worked commercially, and his frustration with everything from his career to the political scene creeps into the rest of these songs. The lyrics of ""Tape from California"" mix political statements and surreal imagery, and the song features a contemporary band with electric piano and drums. Ochs wrote ""The War Is Over"" for a rally that he helped organize; its marching band backdrop is interesting, but the song isn't as strong without its context. ""William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed,"" on the other hand, hauntingly reflects Ochs' experience at the '68 Chicago convention. It appeared, along with the mournful ""Rehearsals for Retirement,"" on an album whose cover bore a fictional tombstone: ""Phil Ochs ... Died Chicago, Illinois 1968."" ""Chords of Fame"" and ""No More Songs"" come from Ochs' last studio record, the humorously titled Phil Ochs' Greatest Hits, produced by Van Dyke Parks. The songs tried a country/western sound as a last ditch plea for popularity. This collection ends with an upbeat live version of his signature tune, ""I Ain't Marchin' Anymore""-- but in reality, Ochs' career was over. Writer's block, heavy drinking, and mental illness ended his songwriting and drove him to take his own life in 1976, at age 35. In his biography of Ochs, Michael Schumaker recounts how he worried that his songs would be forgotten. He has yet to be seriously ""rediscovered,"" and this generically titled collection probably won't change that (though it is a good and affordable starting point for new fans). As Andy Whitaker said of him, ""His persona was the work of art."" No matter how well the music stands on its own, it works better with an understanding of the time and of the man-- which can be said of our other great journalists, activists, and folk singers. Like them, Phil Ochs gives us our history.","""You're not a folk singer,"" Bob Dylan accused Phil Ochs, ""you're a journalist."" He echoed the most consistent ...

Product Placement,Cut ChemistDJ Shadow,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c59d034d5c69bf52d0/1:1/w_160/e8ce6857.gif,2002-02-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2372-product-placement/,One29,"I have yet to be fully convinced of the relevance of the DJ mix. Are they good at parties? Sure. Are they entertaining? On occasion. Do you listen to them over and over until you have every synth splash and subtle nuance memorized? Ahh, there's the problem. Whether they're comprised of funk, Moroccan trance, Ibiza disco, or some insidious blend of the three, they're usually going to find their way into the ""sell"" pile eventually. Here's why: 1. The At-Home-Listening Problem: I admire a good DJ's ability to get me shakin' that ass on the dancefloor, but oftentimes, that doesn't make for an engaging experience when I'm commutin' that ass from DC to Baltimore in the morning. Rare is the mix, I've found, that can hold up without the usual fog machine and strobe light accompaniment. 2. The Novelty Wear-Off: The first time through, most DJ mixes usually turn up a bunch of surprises, along the lines of, ""Dude, I can't believe he just segued Saul Williams into Sonic Youth!"" But too often, when the shock of an inventive pairing fades, so too does the charm. 3. The Wank Factor: Defined as the prioritization of technique over content; a DJ making ""wikkity wikkity wik"" noises for an hour is about as entertaining as a guitarist going ""deedily deedily deedily"" for an hour. We're all impressed by their amazing dexterity, sure, but isn't there anything else these guys can do? That being said, last year I discovered a mix that successfully avoided all three of the above pitfalls: the much-admired, widely-bootlegged Brainfreeze. A collaboration between icon DJ Shadow and Jurassic 5 turntablist Cut Chemist, Brainfreeze was a one-hour throwdown comprised largely of rare funk and soul 45s. Based around neglected classics like ""The Funky DJ,"" ""The Tramp from Funky Broadway,"" and most famously, 7-11's ""Doin' the Slurp"" jingle, the two kept the overt DJ trickery to a minimum and sculpted a mixtape symphony that withstood repeated listens. Product Placement, the duo's latest collaboration, is being hyped as the sequel to Brainfreeze, with a similar mission (all rare 45s), format (two tracks, one hour) and release (extremely limited). Unfortunately, this sequel status will invariably lead to lazy critics comparing the new release to its cult classic predecessor. Lazy critics like me: it's not as good, and doesn't skirt the above pet peeves quite as nimbly. The album's first track gets off to a slow and clichéd start with the standard self-referential samples and exhibitions of scratching speed. Oddly, the first recognizable song used is Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love,"" which would seem to indicate a different musical direction for the ensuing hour (is there any man less funky than Jimmy Page?). But quickly the piece settles down into a more soulful, chill pace, constructed from a rapid-fire series of laid-back instrumental segments. So the seamless blending demonstrated on Brainfreeze remains intact, but with source material that comes across as considerably less energetic and gritty. Complaint #2 is dangerously courted by the first track's centerpiece, ""Cookin' with Gas,"" a natural gas promotional tune featuring teenagers giving the most awful rapping performances imaginable. While the humor of the song and the DJs' juvenile interweaving of, yes, fart noises rapidly wears off, Shadow and Cut Chemist place it over a sparse, old-school beat that provides a solid foundation for the middle ten minutes of the piece. Soon enough, though, the mix returns to a slow, funky strut that, while enjoyable, doesn't provide much in the way of memorable moments. Lest you think I'm unfairly comparing Product Placement to its predecessor, the second half of the disc begins with five minutes of re-worked Brainfreeze staples like ""California Soul"" and ""I'd Be Nowhere Today."" Using different versions or segments of their previous record's 45s, these tracks no doubt brought huge cheers when the set was played on their late 2001 mini-tour. Unfortunately, it comes across here as sour and cloying. The following sections utilize a variety of commercial jingles (hence the title) and novelty tunes espousing the virtues of soft drinks, milk, Motocross, and more. Obviously attempts to recreate the popular ""Doin' the Slurp"" sequence from Brainfreeze, the results vary from successful (a folk-and-brass solder job on ""The Real Thing"") to near unlistenable (revving motorcycle noises are, unsurprisingly, sort of hard on the ear in any context). By re-mining the same territory of their previous mutual effort with less compelling material, Product Placement falls into a trap familiar to sequels of another genre: film. It would be overly harsh to say DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist have produced their Staying Alive here, but in the end, the album is no more satisfying a follow-up than, say, Jaws 2. It's a damn shame: had it been an Empire Strikes Back, this reviewer might have been that much closer to seeing the DJ light.","I have yet to be fully convinced of the relevance of the DJ mix.

Space and Time: A Compendium of...,Orange Alabaster Mushroom,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ebc0084474cd0c2706/1:1/w_160/fe2c469a.jpg,2002-02-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6016-space-and-time-a-compendium-of/,Hidden Agenda,"There are thousands of them out there. The people who toil away the hours by setting up mics in the hallway, bouncing track after track of sound on their four-tracks, ensuring that independent music can never die. On one hand, it's very easy to romanticize this kind of thing: musicians who do their work with no guarantee of ever being heard are sort of like monks, practicing their arts far away from civilization, completely at odds with what the material world would have them accomplish. How noble, to stick so closely to their ideals, that they would work so hard for no apparent reward other than hearing the sounds in their heads played back. On the other hand, theoretically, anyone can do this. Go pick up a recorder, and sing and play and bounce to your heart's content. As Milhouse said, ""Fun is fun,"" but some of us have to listen to the stuff, too. It would be nice if everyone who was taping themselves made good music, but often (and I can personally attest to this), the music is like an inside joke only understood by the teller, and perhaps a few of his best friends. Of course, sometimes people are forced into this method due to circumstances. In other words, if you don't have the cash or label support to record in a big, fancy studio, how else to make music but by recording at your house or garage? In a perfect world, the Music God would automatically give the most visionary musicians record contracts, but as it is, the kids will have to make do with what they have. I imagine Canada's Greg Watson is one of these types, masterfully producing his own stuff because nobody else will. Watson's virtual one-man show, the Orange Alabaster Mushroom, plays amazingly well-crafted psychedelic pop, generally from the British angle. He started recording in 1991 under this moniker after working with a band called the 14th Wray. His first music was actually issued under their name, despite being almost entirely written and recorded by Watson. He did eventually end up recording in a proper studio in the late 90s, though the results retained his DIY aesthetic and only emphasized how spot-on his psych arrangements were. As for the music, I'd say the Dukes of Stratosphear have nothing on this guy. I don't generally go out of my way to listen to anything that resembles a genre exercise, but the Orange Alabaster Mushroom is so amazingly precise in its depiction of '66-'67 era British psychedelia I'm drawn into the stuff by its sheer persistence. And to top it off, these are very good tunes-- what's the value in copying anything verbatim? Watson's music would sit well on a shelf next to Nuggets, and that's the best compliment I can give this release. Space & Time: A Compendium of the Orange Alabaster Mushroom is a compilation of material released from 1991 through 1998. Watson recorded most of it on four-track, but a few tracks, as mentioned earlier were done on eight-track in a studio. ""Your Face Is in My Mind"" is actually one of the few American-flavored tracks, recalling bands like the Seeds or ? and the Mysterions with raging Farfisa organ and raucous garage-grunge guitar. The opening organ exposition, which actually reminds me of Iron Butterfly more than anyone else, is alone worth the price of admission. And check this: ""Your face has left impressions/ Deep inside my cranium/ And when those thoughts are realized/ It's here I find/ That your face is in my mind."" That's a lyric, my friend, which Watson delivers with whiny, crass sincerity. No great psychedelic band could exist without its own title song. Watson's ""We Are the Orange Alabaster Mushroom"" fits the bill here, and is prime Small Faces, circa Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, with its anthemic chorus and aggressive drumming. ""Sunny Day"" is a tart slice of music-hall, while ""Tree Pie"" gets by on sheer aggression and hyped up soul power, courtesy of harmony vocals in overdrive and a guitar solo so of a different era that I wonder if the Seeds' Jan Savage wasn't beamed in for the occasion. (By the way, Jan, where are you?) Other tunes take the softer approach: ""Another Place"" features a rather beautiful guitar line, and telling lines like, ""I don't belong here, though there is another place I can go."" Watson's vocals are still in trebly, whiny mode, yet he manages to bring out some inherent sweetness in this music. Another charmer is ""Valerie Vanillaroma,"" featuring nice Byrds-y twelve-string guitar and relatively smooth harmony vocals. The bridge's guitar and organ hits are classic, and if there's a fourth ""Austin Powers"" movie (as if I had a doubt), they need to get Watson to write the love theme. If psychedelic isn't your thing, then obviously this album isn't for you. Furthermore, if hearing vinyl ticks on a CD (this collection is a re-release of a vinyl set from 1999, and they apparently just took the old records and transferred them to compact disc), then you might get annoyed with this. However, you can only dog on addictively catchy, well made psych-pop for so long before giving in to the groovy sounds. No, this record isn't a major statement, but it is almost flawlessly executed. Chalk one up to the bedroom musician for keeping this music alive.","There are thousands of them out there. The people who toil away the hours by setting up mics in the ...

Titles and Idols,Beth Hirsch,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0ed5e6ef9596932361a/1:1/w_160/dc526ed0.jpg,2002-02-03 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3878-titles-and-idols/,!K7,"For a moment back in 1998, Beth Hirsch could have had it all. Her astonishing and immediately moving vocals made human the endearingly plodding anachronisms of Air's Moon Safari. Had she released an album of songs as lush as ""All I Need"" and ""You Make It Easy,"" Hirsch would have been bigger than Dido. Three years later, Titles and Idols trots along and I'm a little upset. Not as upset as I was when I heard Hirsch's rummage-sale cash-in of a debut, 2000's Early Days, but upset nonetheless. Hirsch and her collaborators have clearly worked hard on Titles and Idols. Not a note out of place, not a beat out of sync, not a lament out of earnestness, this is an electronically upgraded, preciously beautiful coffee-shop poetess album. Its honesty and integrity are too long-faced for me. Paying close attention to the guileless Titles and Idols makes me fantasize about Hirsch performing the vocals to Air's blowjob panegyric ""Wonder Milky Bitch."" Perhaps I'm asking her to be a little super-freaky and it's her right to say no. But fifty minutes of humorless observations about relationships out of whack and ill-starr'd attempts at happiness get me hungry for some shameless grot. Diving straight into territory identical to Everything but the Girl's Temperamental, Hirsch swoons and graciously moans through the beatless mix of ""Let It Live."" Thick synth pads and a wisp of a pedal steel guitar accentuate Hirsch's gorgeous voice. ""I Know Why"" is the first of four songs on this album featuring Black Dog (aka Ken Downie) as producer. And surprisingly, Downie doesn't smother Hirsch in techno, instead sending rhythms skittering across Hirsch's facsimile Clouds-period Joni Mitchell-isms. Avoiding the thumping assault weapon production of Kosheen's ""Hide U,"" Downie finds a balance between his technology and Hirsch's voice. On the title track production, Custom Blue doesn't match Downie's delicacy. Nonetheless, the big drums and furrowing bass compliment Hirsch's defiant delivery. The partially spoken word ""Captain Daylight"" is as coffeeshop as Titles and Idols gets, with a distant squeeze box lending a sea shanty vibe to the already briny waltz. ""Nest Sensation"" is unmistakably a Black Dog Production-- it bounces like an early Warp bleep release but remains sympathetic to Hirsch's alternately delicate and feisty statements of identity. Still, I can't escape imagining that Hirsch is hinting at a desire to be Alanis Morissette here. Ken Downie keeps Hirsch within the bounds of decency by directing her back to the Joni Mitchell School of Skipping Annunciation for the happy-go-lucky ""Until I Met You."" Producer Jackson from Paris steps up for one cut, the ukulele-glitched story song ""Nigel and Fiona,"" but like Custom Blue and Black Dog, he doesn't allow the production to overwhelm the singer. Titles and Idols finishes with the album's most glaring error, Custom Blue's ""Radical mix"" of the opener, ""Let It Live."" I think Custom Blue wanted to turn Hirsch into a diva ready to take on vocal duties for a mosh-pit-ready successor to Massive Attack's Mezzanine. Having signaled a blast-to-come with distorted, broken guitar chords, the producer doesn't have the courage of his convictions to force the mix into an out-and-out rocker until halfway through. At that point, Hirsch can't compete and is left to ululate and to vocalize as the riffs swirl about her like a dervish biker-gang. Though lyrically ponderous and humorless, Titles and Idols is far from being an unpleasant listen. I have no doubts about the effectiveness and the beauty of Hirsch's voice nor her producers' sensitivity to her material. But what gets to me is that Hirsch and her producers don't really let rip. With exception of the failed last track, Titles and Idols, is awfully polite. Breakbeaters Lamb walk in similar territory and avoid sounding prim. Of course, this record errs on the side of caution, and that should serve the album very well commercially. Still, from an artistic standpoint, I can't really consider it an object of veneration.","For a moment back in 1998, Beth Hirsch could have had it all.

Where Psyche Meets Cupid,The Real Tuesday Weld,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21eea9e61561daa4975/1:1/w_160/a8ae96f4.jpg,2002-02-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6702-where-psyche-meets-cupid/,Kindercore,"Before Tuesday Weld became trivia game fodder, she was the disarmingly cute female lead of such 50s and 60s trash-cinema throwaways as Rock, Rock, Rock and Sex Kittens Go to College. Nature takes its course, though. Starlets grow old, beauty fades and cuteness wilts, and, well, now Tuesday Weld is just an obscure bandname, albeit one with an ironic qualifying prefix-- ""(The Real"") is tacked onto the front end. (The Real) Tuesday Weld is nothing more than London native Stephen Coates, a recent art school drop-out and huge Serge Gainsbourg fan. He's also a hopeless nostalgic, obsessed with 1930s jazz and other ancient recordings. In a quixotic attempt to recapture the wafting and ephemeral quality of the prohibition-day records he was exposed to in his youth, Coates has tacked big band samples onto electronic beats and backgrounds, laying down breathy vocals and glib lyrics over the hybrid. And in the end, Where Psyche Meets Cupid is a 15-track concept album of stuff that, surprisingly, doesn't suck. The opener ""Am I in Love"" asks the question, ""Am I in love with my love, or myself?"" over a musical amalgam-- both eerie and cheesy-- of a crackly, submerged big-band horn samples and 70s electric piano tinkling. The result simultaneously reminds me of Foghorn Leghorn, the ballroom scene from The Shining, and the Andrew Sisters' ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy from Company B."" ""I Love the Train"" takes the same basic musical material, but brings a canned dance beat to the fore, resulting in something acutely contrived, yet catchy and effective. Elsewhere, ""At the House of the Clerkenwell Kid"" is an instrumental track that I wouldn't have known was a studio pastiche if it wasn't on this record, and the charmingly titled ""Terminally Ambivalent Over You"" combines an ascending ukulele chord progression with a sexed-out Rhodes keyboard. Annoying faux-scratch turntable sounds mar the composition ever so slightly. ""The Birds and the Bees"" is one of the album's better tracks, coming off like a Brazilian rendition, at half speed, of some John Barry score that never found its way into a Bond film. ""Déjà Vu,"" playing on the haven't-we-heard-this-before theme that is the bedrock of Coates' playful genre-bastardizing, is short and sweet and, like the sensation itself, quickly forgotten. Where Psyche Meets Cupid is best listened to in its entirety. Taken individually, the tracks are as likely to make you raise your eyebrows in disdain as they are to pique your interest. It's as a whole that the album is actually somewhat affecting. The sequencing is superb, and there's a weird elegance and smoothness to the compositions that almost neutralizes the inherent silliness of combining Gatsby-era record loops with 21st century keyboard beats. Oh, and I promise I will never mention Foghorn Leghorn in a record review ever again. Ever.","Before Tuesday Weld became trivia game fodder, she was the disarmingly cute female\n\ lead of such 50s and 60s ...

"Master Sessions, Vol. 2","Up, Bustle and Out",by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f113d1975652139794/1:1/w_160/5be5bab1.jpg,2002-01-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8367-master-sessions-vol-2/,Ninja Tune,"The fine people at Ninja Tune would like you to believe that Up, Bustle and Out's Master Sessions Vol. 2 is a landmark collaboration, ignoring cultural boundaries to bring together two divergent musical styles to create something new. They'd like you to believe it, and frankly, I wish I could. Here's how ""Clandestine"" Ein and Rupert Mould (aka Up, Bustle and Out) create their music. First, they sculpt beats and soundscapes out of old vinyl, then they wrangle up musicians and ask them to play over what they've created. Finally, they paste everything together, adding reverb and effects, shifting pitches, and employing other such newfangled nonsense where needed. For the two-part Master Sessions series, the duo has traveled to Cuba in search of sounds and musicians. They've even brought Portishead bassist Jim Barr along for the ride, though they spend most of this album working with master flautist, longtime bandleader and Buena Vista Social Club guy Richard Egües (and his orchestra). It's an interesting idea, certainly, and the divergent nature of the project's participants has resulted in some interesting parallels. The results are presented not as a collection of Up, Bustle and Out songs, but instead as a sort of audio documentary of the project. The disc itself is something of a mixed bag, its tracks ranging from dub to downtempo trip-hop to traditional Cuban jazz to beat-driven hip-hop instrumentals. Taken as a standard album, this utter disregard for thematic unity can be irritating. But taken as a part of a whole package-- it also includes a CD-ROM full of Super 8 films of the sessions and a written account of the duo's time with our neighbors to the South-- the disc begins to make quite a bit of sense. The first two tracks are pretty standard Ninja-Tune fare, the sort of thing those who've only heard Up, Bustle and Out on compilations are probably expecting. ""Coffee Contamination"" is a darkly brooding downtempo/dub track with soulful saxophone, a steady-toned cowbell, handclaps, and heavy, echoing standup bass. All of this builds to an upbeat drum-machine loop that breaks away to a sampled Cuban vocal which carries over into a repetition of the initial theme. But if this song is the plane ride to Cuba, the next is the arrival. ""Mariel Port, Spanish Harlem"" begins as a solid funk original until it reaches its bridge and hand-percussion and subtle-at-first effects transform it into a dub-fried blaxploitation theme. From there, Master Sessions Vol. 2 takes a different turn. ""Descarga Caramelo"" is the first of a number of traditional Cuban jazz tracks featuring Egües and his orchestra. The transition is somewhat jarring, not unlike, say, the culture shock that must come when two Americans set foot in Cuba. The Cuban jazz, in many ways, isn't too far removed from its origins. A simple piano part gets repeated as claves get claved and cowbells get cowbelled. A few times, we hear the words, ""Yo quiero caramelo,"" and then come the solos; first, a saxophonist, and then Egües and his magic flute, then hand drums, then piano. Next, Egües trades eighths with the saxophonist-- a riff stolen from Richie Valens' ""La Bamba"" is the only way to date the piece-- before we return to the candy-coveting refrain. There's a laid-back element to most of these recordings, as evidenced by the background chatter which seems almost purposely enhanced on tracks like the organ-and-flute duet ""Organo de Bayamo."" The music is simple, yet effective, both in form and content, a throwback to the past. This old-fashioned sensibility shows up repeatedly on tracks not unlike this one, but it's most evident on the album closer, a collage of DAT recordings made by the duo entitled ""Made in Cuba, Pt. 2."" On one, we can just barely hear a conversation over the roaring of a nearby motor. In another, we hear a man passionately cry out a melody as he keeps a beat with assorted hand percussion. In a third, a woman sings, an acoustic guitar is strummed, and a crowd mumbles in the distance. That's it. Simple as can be. It's all fine music. Don't get me wrong. I think I can honestly say that I enjoy every track on Master Sessions 2. Still, it leaves a key question unanswered: what happens when Ein and Mould collaborate with Egües and his orchestra? Sadly, we never really find out. Tracks like ""Jazz Sepulchre"" sees the duo sampling the orchestra, yes, but they never manage to truly capture the flavor of what these musicians are doing. Again, the music is still solid, but it's something of a disappointment to see such a cross-cultural collaboration hinted at but never really achieved. Though at times a bit too disjointed for its own good (most notably in the differing recording styles-- the clean Up, Bustle and Out tracks often don't match with the intentionally unclean sessions), Master Sessions 2 still works, if not as a document of a unique musical and cultural meeting then at least as a solid collection of songs. And that's a good thing no matter what culture you're a part of.","The fine people at Ninja Tune would like you to believe that Up, Bustle and Out's\n\ Master Sessions ...

Point,Cornelius,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a664b1335d7bf1698e04/1:1/w_160/d6dd2096.jpg,2002-01-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1607-point/,Matador,"My initial thought was that, with Point, Cornelius had made an album not of songs but of machines: twittering little trinkets and gewgaws, clockwork formalist tricks, hooks, and grooves, tiny snazzy robots covered with push-buttons and blinking lights. I was mostly wrong about this. But back when I didn't know that, I was all set to talk about Cornelius's Other Half-- Takako Minekawa-- and, more importantly, her collaborators in Dymaxion, who are, by my estimation, past masters of the sonic trinketry, the clever formalist motorik grooves, and the whole concept of ""songs"" as basically Rube Goldberg devices-- these things where you watch Tab A snap ingeniously and unexpectedly into Slot B, and then watch the whole machine teeter back and forth. The trick is that while everyone was trying to meld rock genres and dance genres by throwing blippy textures and drum loops under crunchy guitars, some people decided to use the tools of rock but organize them using the structures of dance or IDM. Point isn't really as like that as I thought, but let's pretend-- just for a second-- that it is: you couldn't possibly ask for anyone to do that stuff better than Cornelius does. Like him or not, he's pretty much the master of this sort of thing-- evidence is littered from his late-period albums with Flipper's Guitar to solo records like 96/69 to tracks like ""Mic Check"" and ""Magoo Opening"" from Fantasma, his more ""proper song""-oriented U.S. breakthrough. Evidence is abundant on Point, as well: one need look no further than the moment where ""Bird Watching at Inner Forest,"" a sweet, jaunty samba, suddenly and masterfully disintegrates into ""I Hate Hate,"" a whirlwind of sliced-and-diced cartoon prog that sounds like Aphex Twin making mincemeat of a track by the Fucking Champs. If you're going to talk about someone who can produce-- someone who can slap together shimmery organic instruments with the same agility as the world's best glitchmeisters and laptop guys-- Cornelius really should be mentioned. And he's gotten a lot better at this than he was on Fantasma, a record that, in retrospect, sounds a little too eager to please-- all the tinny, busy layering and the near-constant bells and whistles now look a little like a hyperactive fourth-grader given free reign at the school talent show. Point backs off. It's more efficient, and thus more minimal: Cornelius has learned where a couple instruments and a couple tricks can do the work of ten of each. It's also a lot smoother and more languid-- the bulk of it actually qualifies to be called ""subdued."" The cleverness, technical mastery and ping-pong stereo effects are all there in spades, but this time they're all much more mellow than you'd think. Listen right and you'll hardly notice them, because you'll be wrapped up by the thing I initially completely missed-- some of these tracks are just plain lovely as songs. That's right: you could very satisfyingly listen to Point while casting Cornelius as some kind of modern-day Esquivel, a master of arrangement and studio technologically and virtually everything that makes you cup your hands over your headphones and be just plain wowed by the stuff that's coming out of them. But the thing is that Point, like the IDM records it shares some of its formalist leanings with, gradually reveals itself to contain some song forms that are, without qualification, quite beautiful and expressive, and in completely non-trinkety ways. It sounds as if he's been listening to more bossa nova-- subtle acoustic guitar rhythms are all over this record. It sounds as if he's made a conscious effort to turn his vocal harmonies from chirpy amazements to swooning, dreamy soft-touches. It sounds as if he's basically loosened up, and figured out where subtly funky flows and immersive, bubbly drifts are way more agreeable than hyperactive flashes and non-stop banging. He has, in many senses, mellowed out. And there's what's good about Point. Cornelius comes across as some sort of über-hipster from the glossy fashion mags, a cultural curator, a buzzy Japanese pastiche guy making music that feels like Bandai pocket games-- I've no doubt that a lot of you will hear Point somewhere and be turned off by precisely this quality, and I'll admit that before throwing Point on I sort of feared that it might be just another totally mid-90s reiteration of that heavily explored model. But Point isn't all about playing with trinkets and baubles. ""Point of View Point"" develops from an airy bounce into some delicious, dynamic, sweeping chord changes. ""Drop"" teases you by offering and then withholding a beautiful groove that sounds like Antonio Carlos Jobim taking a stab at writing funk, and then ""Another View Point"" finishes the job. ""Tone Twilight Zone"" is the equivalent of a Boards of Canada pastoral played live. ""Brazil"" applies singing-Macintosh software to a gorgeous laid-back ode with an oddly country-and-western chorus breakdown, and ""Fly"" is a flat-out prog single, in the best possible way. Cornelius has done well, and he's done it subtly and unassumingly. If you've spent the last six months feeling inclined to listen solely to alt-country records, this may be Officially Not Your Bag. But it's a handsome little bag, and undoubtedly, some people will take great, great pride in wearing it out.","My initial thought was that, with Point, Cornelius had made an album not\n\ of songs but of machines: twittering ...

Rock It to the Moon,Electrelane,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2b5e6ef95969322da8/1:1/w_160/2555961c.jpg,2002-01-31 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2722-rock-it-to-the-moon/,Mr. Lady,"Instrumentals literally don't say anything. They can express almost anything, but they can also give a crutch to someone who has nothing to talk about. Lately, we've also gotten ""film music"": instrumentals that bands write for a movie (often an obscure one), or that were written in a form that sounds like a narrative. In other words, it's music that was made for a film that you will never see. Records like this-- all ten of John Zorn's Filmworks discs come to mind-- have built-in crutches, because the listener already knows something will be missing. We have to trust the band that the sex scene, gun fight or television commercial looks as cool as the theme music. The British four-piece Electrelane play almost nothing but instrumentals on their debut, Rock It to the Moon. The album sounds cinematic, and yet it's definitely more than just background music. Take the second track, ""Long Dark,"" which opens slowly with a throbbing bass and the sound of Mia Clarke scraping her guitar strings. The tension builds as Clarke kicks off a ""Peter Gunn"" guitar line and Verity Susman pulls up with her stabbing, needle-toned Farfisa. They tear it up for a couple of minutes, switch to a slow part, and then rip it up again. Ten minutes, three segues, all rock. There's only one problem: all of the songs sound like that. The tunes shift exclusively between ""fast"" and ""slow,"" and they have so many transitions that playing the whole record is like watching eleven car chases in a row. Even if there's a narrative, the song titles don't help us find it: one song, for example, is simply called ""Film Music."" The two songs with lyrics are concise, and Rachel Dalley's whale song-like bass both relaxes as well as compels. But the album runs for over an hour, and much of the wind is sucked out by the time they hit ""Mother,"" the most knuckle-splitting piece on the album. In small doses, however, it's terrific. There's no doubt Electrelane could beat up everybody in Godspeed You Black Emperor!. Mike Patton's Fantômas may get in and out quickly, and Tortoise may have nice textures, but they can't match Electrelane for volume: without solos, hooks, or blatant virtuosity, they kick out music that flares overhead like rockets and flaming school buses. And that may be why Rock It to the Moon seems deficient-- it doesn't take an hour for them to make their point. The first time I heard them, I wondered if Electrelane play movies when they're on stage. As it turns out, last summer they arranged their set around films by Jean-Luc Godard. Maybe if they can get Godard to contribute lyrics next time out they'll have a bigger winner.","Instrumentals literally don't say anything.

The King Beneath the Mountain,Surface of Eceon,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e5b1335d7bf1698cea/1:1/w_160/4cc63c18.jpg,2002-01-31 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7635-the-king-beneath-the-mountain/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Olympia's new Strange Attractors Audio House is off to a great start. The label's third release was last year's underlooked Oceanless by Landing, a swirling maelstrom of harsh feedback and delicate guitar melody that was a worthy addition to the drone-rock canon. Now, Strange Attractors has followed the Landing release with this equally fine debut record by Surface of Eceon, a unit composed of three members from Landing and guitarist/vocalist Adam Forkner of Yume Bitsu. As one would expect from a band made up of \xBE of an existing group, Surface of Eceon shares many qualities with Landing. Though vocals play a slightly larger role here (two songs have complete verses, if no choruses), the longish pieces are still mainly epic guitar instrumentals laced with impressionistic percussion, analog synth drones, and every conceivable kind of effects unit. And though this album is stuffed with psychedelic-dreamdrone ear candy, the sound coating would mean little if the band were not so accomplished melodically. ""The Open Sea"" opens the album and immediately reveals a kinship to Landing and Yume Bitsu. A chiming guitar sketches out the chords as the song gains momentum. An almost unnervingly clear voice sings a spare melody, revealing Surface of Eceon's song-oriented bent, but the voice disappears as the guitars fall in and the chord changes become movements between massive walls of sound. Classic shoegazers like Lush are an obvious reference point, but the structure of the melody and the quality of the voice remind me of Low (with an explosive psychedelic backdrop). ""Silence Beheads Us"" is a beautifully paced track of fertile, dripping wet drone. Tentative feedback gurgles set a placid mood that never leaves, though frayed seams of distortion weave in and out as the track progresses. Fans of Windy and Carl looking for something looser with a slightly more prickly edge take note. ""The Grasshopper King"" is the rockingist track, with a bouncy rhythm and The King Beneath the Mountain's lone riff, a happy guitar pattern overflowing with feedback and joy. The jam-out nature of ""The Grasshopper King"" is true to the Surface of Eceon aesthetic, as most of these tracks were birthed from lengthy improvisations. Unfortunately, the jam aesthetic betrays Surface of Eceon on one occasion, the sloppy and poorly recorded ""Council of the Locusts."" Though this track boasts an impressive cache of dark energy, the guitars meander aimlessly and never congeal. The band does redeem themselves, however, on the 16-minute closer ""Ascension to the Second Tier of the Outer Plane of Dryystn (Ecyeon)"" (uh, so yeah, there may have been some drugs taken somewhere along the way here), much of which is gorgeous ambient guitar work in the Fripp/Eno vein. Altogether, The King Beneath the Mountain is a riveting collection of textured guitar noise.","Olympia's new Strange Attractors Audio House is off to a great start.

Come with Us,The Chemical Brothers,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59613d1975652138fb8/1:1/w_160/83f6bed4.jpg,2002-01-30 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1417-come-with-us/,Astralwerks,"When the Chemical Brothers are on top of their game, it's hard for anyone in their genre to touch them. In those moments, their sound threatens to go completely over the top, the massive beats and electronic squelches ripping through the speakers like they're about to physically jump out into your living room. Back in '97, I would drive around listening to ""Block Rockin' Beats,"" unable to feel like anything but a bad motherfucker. I might have only been behind the wheel of a Jetta, but that's not the issue. Of course, a good way to judge a Chemical Brothers album is via the ego-inflation factor. If you're feeling like Al Capone with a fat bank roll and a baseball bat, the Brothers are achieving the desired effect; if you feel like you're shopping for designer footwear, things have veered horribly off-course. The fact is, the Chemical Brothers' greatest strength lies in their ability to lay down irresistibly fat basslines and breakbeats that would make Bootsy Collins' fingers bleed. A good Chemical Brothers track should bulldoze any form of criticism simply because it's a strictly visceral experience-- you press play and send the frontal cortex to its room to play with blocks for a while. The big question going into Come with Us was whether they'd come out Kung-Fu fighting or serve up another batch of watered-down techno beats like those dished out on their previous album, Surrender. I wanted to see them rely less on guest cameos (almost invariably a bad sign)-- Bernard Sumner and Hope Sandoval should stay as far away from the studio as possible, preferably with a 300-pound bouncer with a pit bull screening the door-- and they generally do. Sure, Beth Orton and Richard Ashcroft managed to get their fingers in the pie, but some of these tracks also return to what the Chemical Brothers do best. In the end, it's a mixed bag. Come with Us flies out of the gates unexpectedly with its first three tracks, immediately dragging the listener through a relentless torrent of beats and sonic energy. The title track, with its agitated, looped strings, undulating waves of syrupy keyboards, shouts, and strong backbeat, is reminiscent of the Beastie Boys at their most raucous; ""It Began in Afrika"" is a rapid, heart-pounding conga workout that distills the quick reflexes and primal urges of a cheetah hunt under a deadpan voice repeating, ""It Began In Afrika-ka-ka""; and ""Galazy Bounce"" features a repeated call-and-response sample over tight, driving slap-bass funk. None of this is a thought-provoking music in the slightest, and I wouldn't want it any other way. These tracks are purely functional-- all speed, sweat and clenched muscle-- and, as convenient packets of immediate party energy, they succeed admirably well. Of course, it's when the Chemical Brothers deviate from their role as Big Beat deities that problems arise. ""Star Guitar"" apparently substitutes for the missing Sumner track-- it's slight, but not nearly as vapid as ""Hoops,"" the song that follows it. Honestly, none of the remaining material returns to the quality of the first three cuts, though ""My Elastic Eye"" and ""Denmark"" do manage to turn up the heat a bit. But there's not much to be said about the Orton (""The State We're In"") and Ashcroft (""The Test"") numbers, other than that they're both about as middle-of-the-road as you might expect they'd be. ""The Test,"" for example, sounds like a weak companion piece to the Simple Minds' ""(Don't You) Forget About Me,"" and Orton's admittedly seductive vocals aren't nearly enough to rescue an inherently bad song. Yep, Come with Us is another let down, no two ways about it. And all because Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons seem confused about where they'd like to go. There are certain things they do very well, yet they don't seem to be content with being pigeonholed as one-dimensional. Unfortunately, one-dimensional is about the only thing they can pull off convincingly.","When the Chemical Brothers are on top of their game, it's hard for anyone in their genre to touch ...

I'd Be Lying If I Said I Wasn't Scared,Little Grizzly,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2aea9e61561daa7655/1:1/w_160/5789dab3.jpg,2002-01-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4816-id-be-lying-if-i-said-i-wasnt-scared/,Quality Park,"Brady tips his hat to Floyd on his way back to the ranch, ignoring the heat of the late afternoon sun and the sweat pouring from beneath the brim of his freshly purchased ten-gallon hat. At the sight of the ranch house, he sighs with relief and leaves his tired horse at the edge of the porch. His spurs clank with each footfall, and he notes the damage done to his fancy new boots as he trudges up the stairs. At the door, he reacquaints himself with his reflection in the window, and knocks. ""Come on in."" He enters, and sees his employer, Gar Price, fumbling with a small black box. ""You seen these?"" asks Gar. ""CD player."" ""You wanted to ask me something, boss?"" ""Yeah, yeah."" Gar mutters, offers a box of cigars. ""Smoke?"" ""Don't mind if I do."" Brady strikes a match against the heel of his boot. ""You wanted to see me."" ""Well, Brady, I got this new CD-- for the newfangled phonograph there. Band called Little Grizzly. Texas boys. Ever heard of them?"" ""I reckon I haven't,"" says Brady. ""It's these four renegade cowboys from up round Denton. Leader's George Neal and he's got some real city slickin' ways about him. I think that's mighty suspicious."" ""Yessir."" ""I'll be damned if I know what to make of this music. I know you're something of an educated man, Brady, and I was wonderin' if you could make heads or tails of this."" Gar pushes a button on the black box and the room floods with music. Five cigars and six Tequizas later, after a long period of critical evaluation interspersed with Gar' one-sided conversation about upkeep on the ranch, Brady offers, ""I gotta admit, I like that George Neal feller's vocals. He sounds like Wayne Coyne with a Western tinge. Hand over that case... yeah, this song's called 'Today Is the Day.' I like that part at the chorus where things start to sound a little more like a sloppy Flaming Lips. That's a good thing, by the way. ""And the lyrics ain't bad, really. Sorta funny and absurd and poignant at the same time. Like on 'Charlotte,' which seems to be about a robot, though I ain't sure. That song may be more your speed. Shows more of its country-roots. Just George Neal and an acoustic guitar."" ""Right pretty,"" says Gar. ""There's a coupla waltzes on this disc,"" replies Brady. ""The first, 'I Though I Knew Better Than That,' is louder but, if you don't mind me sayin', the undue twang makes it sound like novelty. The second, 'Mockingbird Glasses,' is a whole other story. Feels antiquated. Even the lyrics allude to a sort of sepia-toned past of 'Mockingbird glasses, torn waistcoat and glasses, and old movie posters.' The organ work is nice in this song. Adds character to the song without overwhelming the other instruments, and I tell you what, sir, that's becoming a rarity these days. This George Neal is a heckuva multi-instrumentalist."" ""City slicker,"" Gar responds. ""What'd I tell you?"" ""Well, boss, listen up here in 'Sleep Foreign Engine.' It's a sad sort of anti-lullaby. Good song, but the real high point comes with the horn section about halfway through..."" ""Son, I don't know what in tarnation you're talking about."" ""I'll sum up: Little Grizzly writes country-flavored indie pop with more of an edge, than say, Jay Farrar's last album. They're not afraid to turn up the amps and rock Uncle Tupelo-style when the time is right, but it seems somehow wrong to keep drawing comparisons to alt-country bands. With few exceptions-- ""Charlotte, ""Mockingbird Glasses""-- their best stuff comes when they keep the country to a minimum. And the worst tracks on the album-- ""I Knew Better Than That,"" ""Drum Major""-- show the down-home flavor getting the better of George Neal. Over the top dialect and affectation only go so far. Consider, for example, this review. ""On the whole, it's a pretty good 'compact disc.' They take a fairly basic formula you've prob'ly heard before and make it sound reasonably fresh. Some songs are so catchy, they feel almost like guilty pleasures. I say give it a try or two. It'll probably grow on you."" ""Well, I thank you, Brady,"" says Gar, ""but I think it's about time we wrap this up."" ""Yes, sir, I reckon so. But how?"" Gar's head turns into that of a goat's, and his hands become like giant katana blades. Brady's boss has revealed his true identity. And now, he speaks, with a voice that is as thunder. ""I am the demon lord, Abadon. Embrace Satan!"" Quickly, he plunges his mighty katanahands into Brady, who can only utter, ""If you don't mind my sayin' so, I certainly did not see that comin', sir."" Whereupon Abadon feasts upon the lifeless flesh of his employee until he finally bursts into several smaller demons and disappears through the walls.","Brady tips his hat to Floyd on his way back to the ranch, ignoring the heat of the late afternoon ...

Ten to Ten Past Ten,Gaji,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bed6abf31b7dc71561ee/1:1/w_160/5fc73422.gif,2002-01-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3374-ten-to-ten-past-ten/,Compozilla,"Bands like this don't come around everyday. Or rather, bands like this usually take a while to develop before coming around. I imagine a half decade or so of learning the ropes, releasing things that go nowhere except as one-off tracks on mix tapes for that girl you met at that local band concert last weekend. Usually the bands get some kind of grassroots following, starting in their town, and they luck into getting featured on a CMJ sampler, and then get name-dropped on an indie zine year-end poll (if only by the guy who likes a bunch of no-name hardcore bands). Fairly soon afterwards, the band releases an EP on a big independent label, and are the talk of free publications everywhere, though still so far underground to the general public as to be relatively non-existent in the greater scheme of things. At some point, this band will tour with a slightly bigger unknown band who has been receiving props from the same zines for a couple of years now, and who is at the point where their next record has to be a hit or they'll lose the attention of big labels (indie or not) and big venues. And the little band who's still very much on the way up, who has worked their sound into a precise, angry young package, hardly sees that, unless they headline the same tour next year, they're well on the way to becoming yesterday's news. But they're probably still a good band whose only flaw was taking a little time to develop. But Gaji is here, and they are full-grown. Of course, they had their small beginnings in Tokyo in the early 90s, but didn't release anything, save some singles and seven-inches, until 1999 when their first record garnered them exactly the same kind of underground raves in Japan I was talking about. They played shows with the right people (Ruins, among others), got compared to the right people (Melt-Banana and Zeni Geva, to name a couple), and if they had only been distributed outside of their country, they'd have doubtlessly made the infamous indie splash in all parts. The great thing I hear in this band is that they don't appear to be playing towards their peers or press. Ten to Ten Past Ten, their second full-length, sounds like a punk band who somehow learned that just playing the old sound, or even updating the old sound for all-important cred points, wasn't really the point. Gaji, a four-piece led by vocalist Yuko Hasegawa, plays music rather distinct and passionate, and I hope they have as little regard for the formula of making it big as I do. This introduction isn't my ad for the band, but it is something of a thank-you note to people who play their stuff without much pretense other than jamming out seriously hard shit (just like the old bands used to do), yet don't sound like anyone one else. That's Gaji, as far as I can tell. In Japan, they get lumped in with Melt-Banana, but they're hardly that spastic, instead opting for surprisingly intricate (sometimes broaching minimalist) guitar and basslines, albeit very aggressive ones. ""Southwest"" leads off the album with Hasegawa spitting out lines like, ""String puller/ Beat ruler/ Beat ruler/ Inciter,"" protesting who knows what injustice over angular guitar and basslines seemingly more suited to old school math-rock bands like Slint or Don Caballero. Thing is, this isn't some abstract brainfreeze music, but as punk as anything SST put out. Of course, they don't really sound like Black Flag, but you probably guessed that by now. ""Flower of Conspiracy"" actually starts with little more than a simple, soft guitar figure accompanied by clicking drumsticks. It gives way to a bit of feedback, and then dives into a very straightforward, almost droning piece of music. Drummer Chisaki Taguchi never plays more than is absolutely necessary to carry the band, and the bass and guitar worry so little about fleshing out the sound you'd think it was a demo-- if not for Hasegawa's priceless deadpan vocals, which are often similar to the Waitresses' Patty Donahue or even Exene Cervenka at her most passionately desensitized. But when Hasegawa drops lyrics like ""spinning spiral in a silence"" and ""men betray repeatedly, lament,"" I don't doubt she has quite a bit of emotion invested in this. The best moment of the album for me comes in the transition between ""Mute"" and the title track. The former is a lengthy tune, with only single word exclamations from Hasegawa, and a rhythm section that sounds like it was recorded in my hallway, with all the edges smoothed out by natural reverb, and repeating guitar figure that would make Tortoise proud. This builds for several minutes, and then-- pop-- nothing. The whole thing disappears, only to explode into ""Ten to Ten Past Ten."" Guitarist Yui Kimijimi has his Robert Fripp-meets-D. Boon riffs down pat, and then some. This is their best tune, due not least to the extremely compact arrangement (again, no wasted notes, amazing riffs or circus freak intensity), and an odd vocal, landing on notes that somehow turn the mood from angry and resistant to something like mystical hardcore. It's a very strange, inspiring song (check the ""chronic depressed states be over"" line for further proof). Now for the bad news: you're probably going to have to work to get this, as it hasn't been released outside of Japan. Once again, the indie cycle of failure threatens to strike, but if you're willing to look around, you can find it. Gaji aren't going to change the world with this release, but I suppose given the right set of circumstances and a willing audience, they could get a chapter in the Arcane Annals of Punk. Bands like this, fully formed and beyond being ready to fight, are rare enough that even if they aren't getting their due off the island, they'll probably find a way to make waves elsewhere.","Bands like this don't come around everyday.

The Eric's Trip Show,Eric's Trip,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9feb335119a49eccde/1:1/w_160/9031097f.jpg,2002-01-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2828-the-erics-trip-show/,Teenage USA,"It's all been said so many times before. I probably don't even need to go beyond this. Half of you know what I'm going to say. I feel trite just thinking about it. And yet, as is always the case, necessity squelches the desire for originality. Here goes: This live album, while a must-have for die-hard fans of the group, will disappoint those who are looking for an inspiringly different interpretation of the band's canon. Live albums are tricky business. One out of fifty times, a live album provides a stunning insight into a spontaneous, dynamic performance, or a collection of particularly outstanding performances spanning a given period of time. The other forty-nine times, a live recording is little more than a collection of a band's songs run through a bulldozer and stripped of a good deal of their ornamentation, complexity, and character. And thus, the above statement comes into play. If you love the songs, you'll love the slightly different versions of the songs; if you don't give a fuck about the songs, you're wasting your time. In the case of Eric's Trip, the live treatment does marginally alter the nature of the band's music, sometimes allowing some extra vibrancy and energy to come through, but almost always removing a good deal of the charm that makes their albums so appealing. Eric's Trip slapped together beauty and noise in a fantastically haphazard manner, jumping with reckless abandon from lazily strummed acoustic guitars to hectic, screeching feedback. On The Eric's Trip Show, the contrast between the various sounds employed by the band is greatly downplayed, replaced by a steady stream of consistently rocking numbers. Which is not to say that there aren't some absolutely lovely songs on The Eric's Trip Show. The album opens with ""Stove,"" a classic cut from the band's debut, Love Tara, featuring Julie Doiron's gorgeous, breathy vocals. It's all well and good, but it doesn't do much in comparison to the original, with its dreamy cymbal crashes and intensely intimate recording quality. Indeed, the loss of intimacy is a big problem with this album, as the close-up, lo-fi recording that helped make Eric's Trip's proper albums so great is no longer a factor. The band plays their songs through, and the songs themselves are pretty damned good. On tracks like ""Blinded,"" Mark, Chris, Julie, and Rick really start to rip shit up-- a needed blast of energy, and a nice addition to The Eric's Trip Show, but certainly no replacement for the moments of sheer brilliance that can be found in the band's albums. Which brings me back to the original point. The songs on The Eric's Trip Show are very good songs. I'd venture to say that some of the more straight-up rock numbers actually sound better here than they do on studio LPs. But generally speaking, this album leaves Eric's Trip without some of their greatest musical assets. If you're in love with the songs, this probably won't matter to you; if you're not, this won't help. But you already knew that.","It's all been said so many times before.

For the Birds,The Frames,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0fabf31b7dc71560b4/1:1/w_160/a21f8377.jpg,2002-01-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3172-for-the-birds/,OvercoatPlateau,"When I hear the name Steve Albini, I tend to think of a certain sound. Namely raw, primal rock. Rapeman, Big Black, Shellac, Nirvana's In Utero, the Pixies-- the man's name is practically synonymous with music that takes no prisoners. His dry, treble-heavy sound has graced literally hundreds of albums over the past decade-and-a-half, and his style has become so developed that a lot of people can listen to an album and tell that he recorded it. Considering all this, you can imagine how shocked I was to open the liner notes of the Frames' fourth album and see his name in there. For the most part, For the Birds is just about the antithesis of what we've come to expect from Albini: gentle, hushed folk-inspired rock that only occasionally rises to a shout. As it turns out, Albini only helped record a few songs for the Irish quintet, and though it's never specified which ones, it's easy to guess. The rest of the album was produced by the band with the guiding hand of dEUS's Craig Ward, who seems nearly as unlikely a candidate. For the Birds opens with a plaintive, soothing instrumental aptly titled ""In the Deep Shade."" Guitar harmonics, brushed drums, violin and a smattering of piano eddy about calmly, sometimes moving forward rhythmically for a bar or two, but never truly settling into a prolonged groove of any kind. It's little short of the perfect set-up for an album that abounds in pleasantly atmospheric, but rarely uninteresting, music, broken by the occasional foray into noise-drenched slow rock. ""Lay Me Down"" follows, riding a constant, choppy beat and lightly picked acoustic guitars. Glen Hansard's vocal melody is syncopated in such a way that it sounds at first like he's singing out of time. Once you get used to his phrasing, though, the melody takes hold easily, contrasted by slow, droning violin interjections between verses. Hansard's understated delivery also works nicely for ""What Happens When the Heart Just Stops,"" the quiet ballad that follows. Subtle electronics weave their way through the mix, gradually becoming denser as the song swells to its dramatic climax, complete with a fine, Left Banke-ish horn section. Though most of the album keeps the tempo held way back, a few songs manage to inject a faster beat, and nearly always to positive effect. Most notable is ""Fighting on the Stairs,"" which is the most obvious candidate for a single. Programmed drums lay down an almost danceable groove for an otherwise mostly acoustic song, making for a nice blend of textures. Banjo and vibes fill in the corners of the song, leaving room for some sort of oscillating synthesizer and closely harmonized vocals. Three of these songs bear the obvious mark of Albini, each in the form of harshly noisy guitar passages. The band handles noise best on ""Headlong"" by balancing it with resolutely melodic violin and lead guitar parts, which isn't to speak of the way they easily morph the gentle chorus refrain into an aching plea for help in the raging bridge. The noisy passage that closes ""Santa Maria,"" however, is fairly shapeless, and actually detracts from an otherwise passable song. The guitars are similarly molten on ""Early Bird,"" though the vocal melody greatly overpowers them in the mix. The song quiets in the middle to allow the sinewy violin line to come to the fore, but is quickly swallowed again by restrained feedback and gritty guitar work. Its duration is cut short by an uncharacteristic moment of tape manipulation, which segues surprisingly well into ""Friends and Foe,"" which is perhaps the most subdued song here. Subtle tremolo picking in the background, understated splashes from a keyboard and soft strumming are all Hansard has for accompaniment during the ultra-quiet verses. A surprisingly Dirty Three-like violin and guitar section actually brightens the song considerably in the middle. ""Disappointed"" takes the title of most lo-fi song on the album, as Hansard sounds like he's phoning in his performance from another town. That's not to say his delivery isn't as passionate as usual, though, and his lyrics seem to sum up the general feel of the whole album with their refrain of ""I'm not mad/ I'm just disappointed."" Comparatively, closer ""Mighty Sword"" is upbeat at its tempo of roughly 60 beats per minute. The song picks up for its coda, breaking into a steady waltz beneath cleanly strummed guitars and theremin. The Frames have created a unique and enjoyable album with For the Birds, one that leans decidedly away from the pop spectrum, but never sacrifices accessibility. Perhaps the album's single greatest flaw is that the band have chosen to concentrate almost too much on the slow and sparse, but they do it well enough that it's hard to complain too much. When all's said and done, For the Birds is really for just about anyone.","When I hear the name Steve Albini, I tend to think of a certain sound. Namely raw, primal rock. Rapeman ...

"I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation",Goodheart Allen Powell Trio,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf6cea9e61561daa7a6c/1:1/w_160/2e53ee71.jpg,2002-01-29 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3518-i-can-climb-a-tree-i-can-tie-a-knot-i-can-have-a-conversation/,Road Cone,"Contrary to popular belief, the scariest part of any horror movie is not the moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor, unsuspecting victim. The truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawn-out moments before the bloody death when the soon-to-be victim is creeping through some deserted mansion/wharf/warehouse as a string section pulsates toward some crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach. This is the unsettling part, not because of anything that's happening onscreen, but because of what the audience knows must be coming. The question is never what will happen, but when. And the best horror films are those that toy with the audience, always keeping the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise. The same principals, in many ways, hold true to jazz. As magnificent as a spirited free-improvised burst of balls-out drum-thumping, vicious bass-plunking, blood-rushing horn-skronking, and furious piano-thumping may be, the true measure of a band is how they find their way in and out of such moments, how they build, foreshadow and sneak quietly away after the deed is done. The Goodheart Allen Powell Trio knows enough to linger on the quiet moments. The first four minutes of the trio's debut recording, I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation bears resemblance to John Cage's early chance orchestrations or the Art Ensemble of Chicago in their most abstract form. Silences abound, sounds come in spurts and often step on each other's toes. While there's an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other, at times it seems they're playing by a logic only they can understand. By the time saxophonist Josh Allen pipes in with our first hints of structure-- riffing on the first few notes of ""Amazing Grace,"" no less-- we've already grown comfortable with the idea of this loose-fitting avant-jazz trio. But when Matthew Goodheart and Garth Powell jump on this bandwagon (playing piano and percussion, respectively), sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wild-and-crazy avant-freak-out stuff, all notions of comfort are thrown out the window. This is when, with one well-timed cymbal-crash, the whole thing comes to a dead halt. Then, against a backdrop of silence, as if to comfort the unnerved listener, Goodheart plunks out a soothing lullaby. Before the song, entitled ""Waiting for Our Careers to Take Off,"" is over, this, too, will have mutated into another one of these freakouts. Still, the noisy moments are atypical. Most of I Can Climb a Tree is quiet, subtle. Indeed, these occasional spurts of madness seem present mostly for contrast's sake, to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration. Any good horror film will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build to a letdown. You know, those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway, his fear heightened by clichéd music, opens the door, and the audience subconsciously braces themselves, only to find the character's friend standing on the other side of the door? These scenes serve to build suspense. Similarly, songs like ""The Water is Wet,"" which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the drastic shifts of the two opening tracks, serve to string listeners along, which makes those songs which do crescendo (like the comparatively straightforward ""Accumulation #1"") that much more effective. All this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who, seeing three names he didn't recognize on the cover of a jazz album, immediately became skeptical. But not only are Goodheart, Allen and Powell all solid musicians in their own right, they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe this is only their first recording together. Granted, a look at their lineage explains a lot. These are musicians who've worked with the likes of Eugene Chadbourne, Cecil Taylor and Mats Gustafsson; it's no wonder their music is so damned seamless, tight enough that they must be scripted, yet too natural and too bizarre to be anything but improvised. This is a group that frolics at first, loose notes falling where they may, only to snap to attention like a terrified private at the first sound of his commander's gruff voice. At times, the Goodheart Allen Powell Trio may seem random, but they're anything but imprecise. Continually surprising, yes. But not scary in the least.","Contrary to popular belief, the scariest part of any horror movie is not the\n\ moment when the psychotic killer ...

No. 4 EP,New Wet Kojak,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ebea9e61561daa8025/1:1/w_160/43086515.jpg,2002-01-29 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5779-no-4-ep/,Beggars Banquet,"Because I can't really talk about New Wet Kojak without referencing Girls Against Boys, and because it seems like nobody can talk about Girls Against Boys without referencing sex, we're gonna talk about sex appeal, and how it is that Scott McCloud and Johnny Temple-- in both their flagship band and their side project-- came to sound like Henry Miller's edits when discussing their music. ""Man, do you hear that libidinous croon? Don't you dig that sexy, swaggering, 'come-hither-and-fuck-me' bassline?"" I'm not entirely comfortable with talking about libidinous crooning, if only because I've always associated it with permed, hairy-chested geezers and some combination of pity and repulsion. Which could mean that New Wet Kojak vocalist Scott McCloud is a shoe-in for Ladies Nite at the Starlite Lounge in twenty years or so. That aside, though, McCloud's vocal stylings work well-- perhaps even better than in the GVSB setting-- with the jazzy, ambient, cooler-than-thou character of New Wet Kojak. In fact, when he talks about rock stars, big tippers, Sophia Loren, and living the low life on No. 4, it makes it easier for the listener to believe he knows whereof he speaks. Of course, this is all tongue-in-cheek. Mostly. The opening track, ""Livin' 2 Low,"" opens with a spacy ambient loop and a smooth rhythm section somewhat reminiscent of latter day U2. And right when you're about to start slithering about the dance floor, McCloud imparts these sexy thoughts: ""The world thirsts for a car/ Deodorant/ The life as advertised."" I've long believed Girls Against Boys smirked at press that perceived their sexy-with-an-edge shtick as anything more than an affectation. Likewise, New Wet Kojak takes the affectation so far overboard that it's hard not to believe McCloud and Temple aren't satirizing themselves. ""Livin' 2 Low,"" with its Prince-style syntax title, seems paean to the steamy Saturday-night-out and winks at the audience. And to clarify: it's not a ""hey baby"" sort of wink. ""Do the Math"" is an infectious, new wave/disco hybrid romp that, as a stand-alone track, nearly justifies the release of the entire single. It's fairly simple, forgoing the ambient gloss of the other tracks for playful bass, Charles Bennington's terrific saxophones (which make a serious case for the widespread reintegration of the sax into the indie dance-pop idiom), and sly lyrics like, ""Real chicks prefer rock stars/ Do the math."" ""Sophia Loren,"" meanwhile, opens with the sound of horns and delicate guitar work, building into a crashing, sneering ruckus (unsurprisingly evocative of pre-Freakonica Girls Against Boys) featuring a strangely metal-guitar flavored sax solo. Unfortunately the energy of the first three tracks falls away on ""Year of the Sheep."" An unnecessarily dirge-like beat-poetry-jam rides over one of the most repetitive piano lines I've ever heard, making this a clear candidate for some throwaway compilation contribution (or, if nothing else, the garbage can). Ditto the remix of ""Love Career."" The original version, one of the high points on Do Things, was hardly begging for a remix as it was. And the No. 4 version, integrating naptime strings samples and uninspired drum loops, is simply boring. So this is a tough call rating-wise. Sixty percent of this CD is dead on-- a solid follow up to 2000's Do Things, and indicator of good things to come. But the last two tracks sully the picture a bit. I'll grant that everyone, even libidinous crooners, have bad days, and some of those bad days are sort of interesting. The second half of this EP, however, is boring. And there's nothing less sexy than that.","Because I can't really talk about New Wet Kojak without referencing Girls Against Boys, and because it seems like ...

Our Constant Concern,Mates of State,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d813d197565213be0c/1:1/w_160/7b19d24f.jpg,2002-01-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5146-our-constant-concern/,Polyvinyl,"Here's a little known fact: rock critics, like physicists, biologists, and food scientists, are perennially seeking theories to institute order upon the chaotic world around them. Every musical scribe aspires to create something as elegant as Scott Copperwood's historic The Inevitability of the Concept Album or Patrick Reilly's famous Cleavage + Low Neckline = HUGE Country Music Sales study. Today, as a Pitchfork Exclusive!, I'm going to let you in on my most-valued personal theoretical creation: the Bands-in-Love Axiom. The Bands-in-Love Axiom is a concept more effectively shown than described. The First Couple of Indie Rock, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore, flaunted it with the heavenly harmonies of ""Cotton Crown,"" though it rarely applied after that. Low's Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker show that Mormons can do it, too, but often keep it restrained under their slowcore blanket. Caithlin de Marrais and Kyle Fischer of Rainer Maria tapped into it occasionally on their first two albums, but gave it up to try to be a low-rent My Bloody Valentine on A Better Version of Me. Still, for a long time, ""Tinfoil,"" off of Rainer's first album served as the linchpin of my theory; the opening ""God-DAMMIT!!!"" the vocal harmony equivalent of love's beautiful train wreck. But then last spring, I stumbled upon a tiny little band named the Mates of State in San Francisco. And lo, my theory was made flesh. The Mates stripped away all those superfluous band members not involved in the central relationship, leaving just two people thoroughly infatuated with each other. Kori Gardner played her vintage Yamaha organ, Jason Hammel banged his drums, and both sang, not just together, but to each other, their eyes locked onstage in what my friend described best as ""The Love Gaze."" Their debut album, My Solo Project captured this vibe surprisingly well, with lines like, ""I color the sky with you/ I let you choose the blue,"" warming the cockles of even the most steely-hearted listener. Our Constant Concern, the band's first album for Polyvinyl Records, promised that the duo was sticking to the same tight formula, causing me to rub my hands in mad scientist-like anticipation of more support for my theory. But alas, it was not to be: the musical spark is gone! And furthermore, things are apparently still all holding hands and eskimo kisses for Kori and Jason, considering the occurrence of their marriage between albums. My theory, what's happened to my beautiful theory?! It's actually really hard to put a finger on what isn't clicking this time out for the Mates, as one would think a two-person band couldn't adjust their sound too dramatically. One possible culprit is the general slowing of the material; by my count a good six of ten tracks stroll along at a tempo best described as ""mid."" Easing off the gas pedal isn't always a bad thing, but here it seems to drain a good portion of the energy the band showed previously. Furthermore, this time around Gardner seems to be using a greater variety of the organ's effects, rather than focusing upon the guitarish sound of My Solo Project (I want so badly not to mention Quasi, but  think Quasi). The strategic change allows us to sample the keyboard's seemingly endless repertoire, such as the xylophone/steel drum sound and a brilliantly fake-sounding brass synthesizer. But without the fuzzy crunch and Hammond-esque bass of the distorted setting, the new songs sound, well, a lot like it's only two people playing. Most traumatic of all, however, is the Mates' movement away from the fantastic pseudo-harmonies of earlier work. On songs like ""La'Hov"" and ""Throw Down"" from the first album, Gardner and Hammel each belted out vocal parts that wrapped around each other in a way far from technically perfect, and thrillingly so. The harmonies on Our Constant Concern-- tracks like ""10 Years Later"" and ""Girls Singing""-- are far less eccentric and less vibrant, sometimes resorting to mere unison singing. The old magic pops up here and there, as in the enjoyably ridiculous Graceland-like vocal intro to ""Quit Doin' It"" and the sugar-high two minutes of ""Halves and Have-Nots."" But these brief flashes, even on a thirty-minute album, do little to keep the dreaded sophomore slump virus from hitting Our Constant Concern. Perhaps, sadly, the Band-in-Love Axiom is only good for one great album per act. Until next time, though, the romanticist in me will hope otherwise. C'mon, guys, do it for my theory.","Here's a little known fact: rock critics, like physicists, biologists, and food scientists, are perennially seeking theories to institute ...

The Royal Tenenbaums OST,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ec5e6ef95969320e5d/1:1/w_160/a76619e8.jpg,2002-01-29 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7872-the-royal-tenenbaums-ost/,Hollywood,"I love Rushmore. You love Rushmore, too. Admit it. I'd wager my lunch money that 98% of regular Pitchfork readers see at least a little bit of themselves in the blue blazer and thick glasses of Max Fisher. We've all had hopeless crushes on teachers, been thrown out of prep schools, and written stage adaptations of Apocalypse Now. You know, figuratively like. Rushmore also appealed to me (and to you) as a rare example of the effective musical movie, where the songs and score perfectly complemented the action on screen. It's no small wonder, then, that the accompanying soundtrack was one of the best in recent memory, playing like a mix-tape with selections hand picked by Fisher himself. British Invasion chestnuts from Creation and the Kinks reflected the angst and paranoia of the film's teenage protagonist, while Devo founder Mark Mothersbaugh's quirky score spoke for the slightly off-kilter charm of the film. Unlike the thinly veiled label showcases masquerading as ""inspired by"" soundtracks for most of today's movies, the Rushmore soundtrack worked as both souvenir and autonomous album. Which brings us to The Royal Tenenbaums, the new flick from the team that brought you Rushmore, and its companion album. Again, you get a healthy helping of Mothersbaugh score, which largely finds him exploring much of the same territory of Rushmore (i.e. the limitless potential of a jazz quartet consisting of acoustic guitar, vibraphone, harpsichord and drums). And again, the score weaves in and out between a choice sampling of 60s and 70s rock, albeit this time from slightly bigger names: Dylan, Velvets, Ramones, etc. But like the disillusioned characters of its cinematic parent, Tenenbaums' songs deal with the more adult issues of loneliness and dissatisfaction. Rather than the sexual frustration swagger of garage rock, the film's bittersweet melancholy is represented by the plaintive acoustic singer/songwriter and the lush, orchestrated chamber pop set piece. These two threads are combined in the bookend tracks by dictionary-definition chanteuse Nico. I'll admit to never really appreciating her contributions on the first Velvet Underground album; her female Bela Lugosi vocalizing always seemed like a particularly unfunny Andy Warhol joke. But ""These Days"" and ""The Fairest of the Seasons,"" with their delicate finger-picking and tasteful strings, somehow fit her valiant struggles with the English language in a more ear-pleasing manner. The threads of Nico's ruminations on loneliness (what, didn't she bang Jim Morrison?) are picked up by the folky stylings of someone named Emitt Rhodes and everyone's favorite mope, Elliott Smith. Furthering the widely held theory that first names ending in ""tt"" lead to chronic depression, both are excellent examples of a genre I call ""shower-rod swinging"" music, or just Kozelekmer for short. Smith's ""Needle in the Hay,"" especially lives up to the term, given the scene from the film in which it plays. But nothing says desolation like stringed instruments playing in a minor key, and both Nick Drake and the Yseye Quartet are happy to provide. The latter's performance of Ravel's ""String Quartet in F Major"" (a composition I'm sure we all know and appreciate, cough, cough) blends particularly well with the more expansive Mothersbaugh score contributions with its playful pizzicato and frenetic string bass. Surprisingly, it's the Mothersbaugh score that steals the spotlight on the entire album, providing a kind of modern classical music that walks the thin line between complete avant-garde unlistenability and Yanni-ism. The many unexpected twists and turns of the epic 7:18 ""Lindbergh Palace Hotel Suite"" (a sudden drop into reggae, an extended drum solo) make more sense in the film, but on disc serve as brilliantly absurd flourishes in the midst of a twinkling orchestral piece. ""Mothersbaugh's Canon"" and ""Sparkplug Minuet"" similarly showcase his growth as a film composer by incorporating a children's choir and flutes. Not all the song selection fits and abets the mood, however. The Clash's ""Police and Thieves"" and the Ramones' ""Judy Is a Punk"" are both great songs, undoubtedly, but stick out with their increased volume and attitude. Bob Dylan's ""Wigwam"" is from the heretofore unknown ""moaning along with a brass section"" phase of his career (1970, to be exact), and is rather unpleasant. Their inclusion is befuddling, considering the more thematically appropriate songs from the movie left off the soundtrack: Van Morrison's harpsichord-driven ""Everyone,"" or Mothersbaugh's merry-go-round organ version of ""Hey Jude."" While Rushmore captured the turmoil of youth, The Royal Tenenbaums soundtrack aims to portray more mature emotions than those of a hormone-crazed fifteen-year-old boy, and mostly succeeds. But then again, you're over that crush on Miss Cross, too.","I love Rushmore. You love Rushmore, too. Admit it. I'd wager my lunch money that 98% of regular Pitchfork ...

From the Belly of Abraham,Hasidic New Wave and Yakar Rhythms,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c071abf31b7dc715646e/1:1/w_160/d0569f89.jpg,2002-01-28 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3760-from-the-belly-of-abraham/,Knitting Factory,"Klezmer jazz: in theory, a very cool idea, especially because I can always do with a little more chaotic joy in my life. It seems that, of all the things to come out of the New York City underground in the 90s, this music has been the most massively appealing. Some of the city's biggest names have this trend to thank for their prosperity: Dave Douglas (with John Zorn's Masada, and his own Tiny Bell Trio), Chris Speed (Pachora, Erik Friedlander), and Jim Black (Pachora, Tiny Bell Trio) all made major statements playing this music. Bands like Pachora, Masada and Hasidic New Wave take the traditional harmony and melody of Klezmer and other Eastern European music, and fuse it with contemporary rhythms and improvisation concepts, quite often coming up with entirely fresh sounds. The only problem is that the concept behind the music can never really make the music itself inherently fun to listen to. I will say that From the Belly of Abraham isn't exciting for me not because of its now-familiar fusion of Klezmer and jazz, but because of its relentlessly ""lite"" (a feat, considering that the playing is theoretically closer to John Zorn than David Sanborn) and/or ""smooth"" atmosphere. Where I want a hard beat or recklessly inspired head, I get ultra-clean production and ""tasty,"" ""in the pocket"" and ""tight"" grooves. Where I beg for something interesting, or just something to get me on my feet, I get something close to the Saturday Night Live Band playing Masada tunes. More amazing is that Hasidic New Wave is made of guys I love: Frank London is an excellent trumpet player, who I first heard on Zorn's classical work Kristallnacht, but is equally adept at straight-ahead jazz; Greg Wall is a similarly excellent tenor sax player, who has the chops and voice to make music ten times more distinct than this; David Fuiczynski is an incredible guitarist, and I've never heard him so laid back (read: muffled) as on this release; drummer Aaron Alexander has worked with folks like Satoko Fujii and Tim Berne. It just doesn't stand to reason that they would form a band that plays relatively smooth jazz. To top it off, they brought in a Senegalese drum ensemble called Yakar Rhythms, a trio of percussionists playing some very complex, kinetic patters under all of the tunes on this album. This really is neat stuff, and I wouldn't mind if someone removed all of the band tracks and just let me listen to Yakar Rhythms play. But that isn't an option. In any case, they do lend an air of eccentricity and genuine excitement to the mix. The first song is ""Waaw-Waaw"" (written by bassist Fima Ephon), and it's clear from the start that Hasidic New Wave will take the beaten path. London's expert muted trumpet lead is doubled by tenor over a slow jam beat and repetitive bassline. As Yakar Rhythms reel off polyrhythms in the background (yes, the production, unfortunately, views this trio as a background element, rather than letting their infectious energy take the lead), the sheer precision and efficiency of the band's playing starts to get me down. There's an interesting invocation from one of the Yakar (presumably in Senegalese) that threatens to bring the tune out of its studio-pro rut, but ultimately to no avail. ""Yemin HaShem"" is a new arrangement of a 19th century Jewish hymn, and begins promisingly with a mournful exposition that quickly leads to a fantastic percussion solo. But just as the energy gets good, and the whole thing seems on the verge of explosion, they commence a fairly standard James Brown (think ""Cold Sweat,"" but accompanied by Senegalese drummers, of course) groove. Why? They play the tune proper over this groove (even going so far as to add the redoubtable Jamie Saft on funky organ), and I wonder how the Saturday Night Live Band would sound playing this. Probably about the same, even down to the typically expert tenor solo. It isn't all a downer: Fiuczynski's ""Frydginator"" takes the exotic beats and comes with a manic head to match the intensity. Yes, it sounds more than a little like Masada, but then it's basically straight Klezmer with a jazz bent, so that's understandable. Also, the solos are very nice, with Wall and London trading fours with real energy and-- very important-- seemingly little concern for hitting a wrong note, playing out of tune, or sounding ""tight."" I hear some people actually go for this type of thing rather than my preferred ""noise"" music (read: music you're not likely to play at a dinner party and/or hear on NPR), but I just have a hard time getting past the perfectly fine-ness of it.","Klezmer jazz: in theory, a very cool idea, especially because I can always do with a little more chaotic joy ...

Time (The Revelator),Gillian Welch,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9f7c0084474cd0c110a/1:1/w_160/fcf1487d.jpg,2002-01-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8620-time-the-revelator/,Acony,"Although his hardcore Compton posturing may have led you to believe otherwise, Tracy Morrow (aka Ice T) was not raised in a Los Angeles ghetto. The Original Gangsta was actually born in another O.G.-- the Original Garden State, New Jersey. But no matter his roots, T had gangsta in his goddamn blood. After his parents died, T realized his ice-cold destiny, determined to move to South Central and adopt the gangsta lifestyle. Luckily for Gillian Welch, the path to acclaim in the folk-country genre doesn't require moving to Oklahoma, Appalachia, or a Mississippi riverbank. Nor does it call for songs about killing people, peddling crack, or mining for black ass-gold (in fact, the latter is probably anathema to the cause). Rather, it's just fine if you sound like you know what you're doing and appreciate tradition, and Welch achieves that with ease. Gillian Welch's third LP, Time (The Revelator) is ample proof. Despite being born and raised in Los Angeles, the child of a husband and wife songwriting duo who scored the theme to ""The Carol Burnett Show,"" Welch has managed to create some refreshingly charming, rustic folk-country music that bears the mark of a culture buried in the Blue Ridge, 3000 miles removed from her home. That she's only 33 makes her feat of authenticity even more remarkable. Welch's selling-point are her plaintive vocals, as tender as they are weathered. Her voice is, in and of itself, a stereotype of the South: genteel, soulful and honest. Even with seemingly frivolous lyrics like on ""Elvis Presley Blues,"" Welch's voice expresses depth, coloring the song with experienced, time-warped romanticism. Accompanying Welch on vocals is a soft palette of acoustic instrumentation. Although the songs carry a greater pop influence than her prior releases, the sound is still unmistakably country. Strummed or fingerpicked acoustic guitar occupies the foreground on most tracks, with the occasional twang of a banjo, as on the bluesy ""My First Lover."" Adding to the spacious character of the orchestration is the album's absence of percussion. The result is plenty of room for melodies, with the focus squarely on Welch's voice. Time (The Revelator) wavers from heartbroken lament (""Revelator,"" ""Everything Is Free"") to Southern nostalgia (""I Want to Sing that Rock n' Roll,"" ""Red Clay Halo"") but not once does it stray from Welch's reflective, reserved storyteller's demeanor. The vocals and lyrics alike are open and vulnerable. More than simply an expression of her music, Time (The Revelator) is a glimpse into the artist's personality. Those without the heritage need to work to attain their destiny. For Ice-T, it meant moving to Compton, living the life of a hustler, and filming cinematic masterpieces like Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo and Frankenpenis. For Gillian Welch, it meant studying at Berklee School of Music and listening to old Delmore Brothers and Carter Family recordings. Whatever her path, though, her results are as good as the original.","The singer-songwriter’s third album offers some refreshingly charming, rustic folk-country music that bears the mark of a culture buried in the Blue Ridge, 3000 miles removed from her home.

Welcoming Home the Astronauts,Flickerstick,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc513d197565213b5fb/1:1/w_160/dccec034.jpg,2002-01-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3099-welcoming-home-the-astronauts/,Epic,"""'Cause you're so Hollywood
You're so Hollywoo-oo-wood
I got to get out of this town..."" -""You're so Hollywood"" (or ""Talkin' Ed McMahon Powerball Schizoid Blues"") Only a year ago, Flickerstick was an obscure band floating around Texas, building a small following, peddling their first album from the trunk of their car, and looking for a break. Perseverance and hope are defining American traits, though, and the same urge that drives us to play the same Powerball number week after week (or the reflex that forces me to renew my Good Housekeeping subscription another year just to give myself a better shot at that Publisher's Clearing House jackpot) is the same urge that drives your typical up-and-coming All-American band. The same VW van, the same stages, the same shitty equipment and twice married groupies... but someday, somewhere, the right person will hear the right demo and everything will change. Darva Conger fantasies do come true. Swallow your pride for a second and you can buy your memories for the rest of your life. ""Don't sell out, don't sell out, don't sell out
You compromise every word you say"" -""Got a Feeling"" (or ""Babe, You Done Got Yourself a Cadillac Now"") As it turns out, Flickerstick contributed a song to a compilation of music by itinerant bands which the right person did hear. The band was subsequently chosen by VH1 to appear on their new reality program ""Bands on the Run."" A film crew was assigned to follow the group on tour and the public was treated to a first-hand glimpse of everyday life on the road. The parties, the women, the whispered exploits previously witnessed solely by roadies and those lucky enough to be ""with the band"" were on display to shock, amaze and entertain primetime American families across the nation. Another set of boozing, rocking, hotel trashing working class heroes was born. Week after week, viewers tuned in to half-pay attention to Flickerstick's ability to shake off the previous night's binge and take the stage like they were trying too hard to be the best band in the world. The VH1 executives were especially pleased with the North Texas lads. After enduring two failed marriages, death threats and a total loss of privacy, Flickerstick was rewarded for their troubles with $50,000 cash, $100,000 in new equipment, a nationwide audience and a record deal with Epic. Flickerstick had arrived. Apparently considering the band's recent history-- coming off of prime time, laurel-crowned, highly visible to Epic higher-ups-- whoever was in charge of promoting the band decided they'd better take all the necessary precautions to get the new signees off on the right foot and not fuck things up. The can't-miss single ""Beautiful"" was released for heavy circulation on radio and TV, and Tom ""Lord"" Alge, who has worked with Blink-182, Live and Weezer, was assigned to remix Welcoming Home the Astronauts for re-release. Alge's thumb in the pie is immediately evident, and just as with the last Weezer album, you wish it wasn't there. ""Come on, I'd like to buy the world a Coke"" -""Coke"" (or ""And Now a Word from Our Sponsors"") The heavy-handedness is evident from the start of the album's first track, ""Lift."" In what's meant to kick off the album with a sonic liftoff, which I assume conceptually ties in with the astronaut theme of the album's title, Brandin Lea's voice rises awkwardly through low electronic drones and soothing feedback in what turns out to be the countdown to 40 kilotons of arena-rock power chords. It's clear from this moment that Alge's tweaking in the studio has little to do with adding anything conceptually to the album. And conceptually, it comes off as little more than rehashed Boston and cover art that has as much to do with the contents of the album as Boston's UFO's have to do with ""More than a Feeling."" I think we can sum it up by saying the remixing simply adds enough conventional gloss for FM rock to swallow it. And while the studio work is unquestionably lackluster, it's not as if Flickerstick themselves really provide much of a hook for the engineers to hang their coats on, anyway. The subsequent cycle of songs ranges all over the map, mixing and matching strains of 70s hard rock, 80s hair bands and 90s post-punk. It's apparent this is a band that was caught looking for an audience. She's only 18 but such a beautiful dream
All she needs is some chloroform and she'll be mine -""Chloroform the One you Love"" (or ""Love, in North Texas"") The lyrics throughout Welcoming Home the Astronauts span a similar gamut of styles. They move from senseless (""Tiny records spin holding in the air that you breathe/ Tearing right through the seams you sew/ It's getting right back to you"") to a poetic sentimentality that only manages to come across as insipid (""I got [more than] a feeling/ It's a feeling that you'll never understand/ It's like a rush to my heart that I hope never ends/ But it all depends""). On certain occasions, the guys try to rise to anthemic heights, like on the Offspring riot calls of ""Hey or When the Drugs Wear Off."" Or with the Go-Go's-style rave up ""You're So Hollywood,"" replete with ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" hand claps. Or the just plain ridiculous ""Chloroform the One You Love."" It's all pretty silly stuff, but if nothing else, it manages to establish Flickerstick as a frontrunner for the Varsity Blues II soundtrack. Welcome Home the Astronauts really only works in two instances: on the single, ""Beautiful,"" and the expansive ""Direct Line to the Telepathic."" The latter gives the only indication of what Flickerstick could be capable of if only they weren't so obsessed with pandering to massive popularity. Since this seems to be their immediate goal, however, and they do a good job of sticking to the well-trodden paths to mainstream success, I see no reason for them to fail, however commonplace the results. Of course, they may self-destruct in the process, in which case we can look forward to seeing them in their next VH1 special: ""Behind the Music: The Flickerstick Story.""","*""'Cause you're so Hollywood

"I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4",Jim O’Rourke,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba045e6ef95969322ad5/1:1/w_160/80d950a7.jpg,2002-01-27 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6041-im-happy-and-im-singing-and-a-1-2-3-4/,Mego,"Despite the ramblings of armchair philosophers and fanatical pseudo-luddites, a computer is not a cold, inherently impersonal entity. Unlike more utilitarian electronic items (calculators, microwaves, etc), computers can be endowed by their owners with a sometimes startling degree of personality. Countless hours of work are often put into creating a computer that bears the characteristics of its owner, or at least the characteristics that its owner wants it to possess. And yet, many people still seem to be reluctant to acknowledge that something warm, organic, and truly personal can emerge from the silicon belly of a Powerbook-- especially when it comes to music. Journalists have been going on for ages about some pieces of wood, molded metal, and a few electromagnets being an extension of the penis. What's so different about the concept of a laptop being an extension of the laptop? No, a computer can't be physically smacked around like a guitar or a set of drums, but its nearly limitless potential for the creation and manipulation of sound makes it a perfect medium for uniquely personal music. I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4 is a collection of three tracks performed by Jim O'Rourke on his laptop computer in New York, Osaka, and Tokyo. Given the nature of these performances, the record inhabits that squishy gray area somewhere between a composition and an improvisation. Since this is the first time these songs have been released, it's impossible to know how much of the album is premeditated. The results of O'Rourke's half-improvisations are absolutely stunning. I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4 is comprised of sounds too intricate and complex to be the product of spontaneous experimentation. But unlike many albums consisting of such sounds, this album moves at the speed of human thought, developing in a subtle, methodical, yet never cold and technical manner. Changes happen slowly enough that you can fully take in every nuance, yet nothing ever seems obvious. ""I'm Happy"" opens the record with nondescript glitchy sine waves playing a sparse, quiet pattern. That pattern swells to a buzzing mass of sound so dense that it seems to comprise a single melodic entity. Gradually, O'Rourke manipulates this one central sonic pillar, adding sounds that vary slightly in melody and timbre. And somehow, he manages to keep ""I'm Happy"" dense enough to be completely enveloping, while still open enough to be noticeably transformed by every one of its individual voices. About halfway through the track, a series of subtle melodic changes and the addition of a humming bass drone drastically alter the character of the song, though the elements comprising remain largely unchanged. Though ""I'm Happy"" fades out with a few moments of dark ambience, the following track, ""And I'm Singing,"" showcases a more playful side of O'Rourke's laptop. Opening with the stuttered sounds of a timer and chime, ""And I'm Singing"" then sees him using looped keyboards and synthesized sounds to create what could best be described as a single fragment of a gorgeous melody frozen in time. Strange, ambiguous percussive sounds create a controlled cacophony, until the song metamorphoses into a minimalistic arrangement of clean and distorted synthesized blips. A single array of melodies is repeated, developing so slowly that it can barely be noticed. It then flows seamlessly into what could be the album's finest moment: a progression of odd, ambiguous sounds backed by distorted sine waves and acoustic guitar. Like its predecessor, ""And I'm Singing"" ends with a brief period of subdued ambience. Whereas ""I'm Happy"" and "" And I'm Singing"" often use a flurry of individual sounds to create the illusion tranquility, ""And a 1, 2, 3, 4"" is much more sparse, allowing the listener to focus more closely on every sound O'Rourke uses. And the sounds themselves are utterly gorgeous-- subtly manipulated strings that quiver and pulsate in slow, sweeping gestures, constantly arranging themselves into new harmonic patterns. As more voices are added, these patterns become more complex and more regular until the end of the song, at which point O'Rourke gently deconstructs the layers of sound that have been building for over fifteen minutes with the introduction of new, thoroughly engaging sounds that function almost like a screen behind which the song can dismantle itself. Indeed, I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4, despite its somewhat ridiculous title and its digital origins, is a startlingly personal, affecting album, drawing as much on the fragile melodicism of folk music as the technical manipulation of minimalism. And considering the strength of the bond that can develop between a man and his machine, this record may be O'Rourke's most direct statement to date.","Despite the ramblings of armchair philosophers and fanatical pseudo-luddites, a computer is not a cold, inherently impersonal entity.

Banks and schools close and there's a brief blurb on the news. But otherwise little notice is paid. Maybe human relations have come so far since King's day that we've forgotten it was no more than four decades ago when things were far different. Maybe. Yet for all the advances our society has made in civility over the last 40 years, we've still got a long way to go. Racism still exists, albeit more subtly than before. Far less subtle in today's society is hatred aimed toward homosexuals, immigrants and robots. Yes, I said robots. For years robots have been denied the rights you and enjoy each and every day. They're thought of as mere machines, no one ever taking into account that they might just be programmed to feel the pain inflicted by such callous ignorance. And the media is no better. For decades now, TV and movies portrayed robots as killers, servants, single-minded ignoramuses incapable of love, art or beauty. But this is a cultural stereotype, as inaccurate as any other. What about the good robots out there? The relentless workers, the visionaries, the musicians? That's right. Robots can make music, too. And I'm not talking about the current legions of Powerbook-toting humans. I'm talking about real robots. Like the ones Pierre Bastien employs on his new release Mecanoid. They're small, simple machines, built by the artist out of Maccano parts and small electric motors, single-mindedly devoted to making music. According to the liner notes, these robots play everything from castanets and marimbas to thumb pianos and seven-inch records to steel-drum and an assortment of ancient instruments from around the world. It's a fair bet that any album that employs such a wide variety of instruments will have a pretty unique, fairly interesting sound. And that Mecanoid does. But this doesn't even take into account the instruments Bastien plays; stand-up bass, electric piano, organ, horns (both prepared and traditional), and some more obscure instruments that I can't even picture. Indeed, this is a disc filled from start to finish with a massive range of sounds. But what about the music? The robots' musical abilities are limited by their simplicity. They play their instrument with no divergence from a predetermined pattern, essentially creating loops. As such, there's an air of monotony to some of this music-- a clunking, mechanical feel. But when a number of these robots are employed at once, their individual patterns inevitably converge in an infinite number of ways. Bastien makes use of this tendency, setting any number of robots into action, allowing their music to fall into a groove, and then adding flourishes himself where necessary. Most songs start slow and then creep along, with an inhuman determination until they reach their conclusion. It's actually quite fascinating-- often hypnotic-- and most of the songs are short enough that they come to an end long before they cease to be interesting. Bastien speaks to the hints of inevitability in his music, choosing palindromes for the titles to each of his songs. The titles, he says, ""reflect the way these little machines function, whether they are read forwards or backwards, they are understood the same way and this coming or going of words/notes can be imagined as an infinite cycle."" ""Tender Red Net"" is a calm, peaceful number that begins as a duet between Bastien on organ and a machine playing marimbas. As it moves on, we hear various clankings in the background, rhythmic record scratches and the soothing melody of low-pitched strings. ""Revolt Lover"" features Bastien on prepared trumpet and bass while his robots manipulate records, suggesting that he puts just as much thought into his own arrangements as those of his machines. On ""Deep Speed,"" Bastien mics the machines themselves and arranges their movements into a rhythm which accompanies a machine playing Casiotone and Bastien's jazzed-up trumpet riffs. No doubt many will dismiss this album as a gimmick, which is a damned shame. The music made by Bastien and his robot band is every bit as delicate and unique as the methods by which it was created. These machines never give up and Bastien promises to keep working with them. Who knows what sort of music he'll be able to create as his machines continue to evolve. And if we ever see a Robot Rights movement, there's no telling what might happen.","And so another Martin Luther King Day has come and gone and with hardly more than a passing notice. Banks ...

New Problems,k.,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb59abf31b7dc7155a83/1:1/w_160/e64e0b9d.jpg,2002-01-27 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4369-new-problems/,Tiger Style,"k. is the ""solo"" project of Ida bassist Karla Schickele, and-- what a surprise-- her debut full-length breaks new ground for mediocrity. In fact, it's hard to imagine a more non-offensive collection of songs that take you neither one way nor the other. New Problems is not bad enough to warrant serious disdain, but neither is it exciting, original, insightful, inspiring, cathartic, or any of the other things I look for in a listening experience. If I could, I'd give this album a rating of 5.00000 to emphasize just how middling it is. Even a bunch of guest musicians-- Tara Jane O'Neil, Schickele's former Beekeeper bandmate Jan Kotik, and most of the rest of Ida-- couldn't add anything redeeming. Things look bleak from the outset. First there's the whole Ida/Lisa Loeb connection (need I explain?), and secondly, the song ""Telegram"" is a Silvia Plath poem is set to music. I don't know about you, but I can't stand Silvia Plath. Not only does she represent the height of poetic pretension to me, but the people who are into her writings are arguably more intolerable than her poetry. Strangely enough, ""Telegram"" was the song I enjoyed the most on the album, if you want to call it ""enjoying."" Let's say that, after hearing it, I shrugged and said ""eh"" to myself with slightly less vigor than with the other songs. But like the rest of the album, it sat firmly at the tolerable level. It's a slightly bluesy, bare-bones type of song-- just acoustic guitar and voice-- and at least for this one track, Schickele doesn't try too hard to be cute or emotive. ""Reminder"" serves as the emotional highpoint of the album, a cautionary tale about getting involved with the wrong guy. It contains some pretty cheesy lines like, ""I don't know your score but I know you're a player/ I know you're gonna break my heart sooner or later."" If nothing else, the song is performed with a little conviction, though with no better way to express it than a little noisy bit at song's end. The rest of the album just sort of sits there staring at you, neither forcing you to get up and turn it off nor leaving you with the desire to hear it again. Interestingly enough, in the brief ""Always So Good,"" Schickele provides the final word on New Problems. Riding a simplified Nick Drake-like guitar figure, Schickele repeats, ""It's always so good but it's never the same."" I can't help but think the opposite about this album: always the same and never so good.","k. is the ""solo"" project of Ida bassist Karla Schickele, and-- what a surprise-- her debut full-length breaks new ground ...

The Ride,Seaworthy,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3905e6ef95969320693/1:1/w_160/2aa4e731.gif,2002-01-27 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7050-the-ride/,Jetset,"If my band was mentioned in Jane magazine's ""Cute Band Alert,"" I'd be worried about looking like some soulless corporate-rock posterboy. Thankfully, Macha put musicianship first. After a trip to Indonesia, the four-piece fused indie rock with Eastern instrumentation, resulting in polyrhythmic songs full of plucked zithers, hammered dulcimers and ringing metallophones. Some said that Atlanta's Macha-men, by using conventional lyrics and choruses, had missed the point: reaching a state of trance. But fusion was the point, and during their live shows with Bedhead, as Macha constantly switched between instruments and launched into intense jams, you could hear an enlightening vibe far more exciting than any Jah Wobble world-beat kitsch. Seaworthy is the solo project of Macha frontman Josh McKay. He's caught between his past and future on The Ride, which ditches Eastern instruments for the most part but still focuses on layered waves of sound (though in an altogether more smooth and subtle approach). The ambiance on this LP carries hints of McKay's pre-Macha days in Emperor Moth, a brooding rock trio from Gainesville, Florida. All three of McKay's projects reveal his draw towards the tension created by the drone, and the moody keyboards and deep basslines here were captured perfectly in the mix done at Andy LeMaster's Chase Park Transduction studio in Athens. McKay's balance between abstraction and conventional songwriting has yielded another great album. The Ride begins with ""Open the Gates,"" as a lumbering dreadnought of a guitar riff plows through staccato percussion and harpsichord-like ornamentation. The sinewy lines segue directly into ""I Met Her in the Candy Store."" The guitars become muted and the sinister feeling fades, replaced by creaking scrapes of feedback crenellated along the main bass groove. McKay's breathy vocals barely raise above a whisper, but they manage to make the otherwise-edgy music strangely inviting. His hushed phrasings are difficult to decipher, but you can make out, ""Your voice invites everyone into contact with your thoughts."" This piece glides into ""Sea Manta,"" a wavering, aquatic instrumental similar to Tortoise's ""Dear Grandma and Grandpa."" ""Lone Star Samba"" is more easily accessible. A hi-hat ticks incessantly amongst other soft percussive rumblings, as McKay warmly sings, ""Talk to me, through the bedroom wall/ Does your guard come down, when I'm not around?"" The second verse begins with vibraphone rolls eddying upward. Snippets of sampled conversation begin to appear in the song, little giggles and laughs punctuating the mix with a sense of intimacy. ""You and me, just one more hour""-- a statement, or a plea? Instead of revelation, a pulsing drone washes into a canyon of reverb on ""In Anticipation Of,"" a short prelude to ""The Day,"" one of two surprisingly great pop tracks that appear in the middle of the album. Prolific Japanese musician Haco glows here, her voice patiently pausing and then echoing dramatically over plodding drums and the accompaniment of ringing bell sounds. ""Identifying the Body"" features vocals from Azure Ray seraph Orenda Fink. Trip-hop beats shuffle while Fink's electronically filtered voice reaches an otherworldly androgyny, even if the hook sounds like Bono on ""The Fly."" This song just soars, all the more surprising that it leads into a disappointing closer. The two-part title track ""The Ride"" aims for the blissed-out distortion of REM's ""Let Me In,"" but the avant-garde vocal harmony sounds as annoying as the choral theatrics Cerberus Shoal has been into lately. The dense, wheezing soundbursts aren't awful, but after so many successful tracks, this murky sequence is a letdown. The photos on the sleeve cover of The Ride are all of bodies: a woman wrapped in a towel, only visible by the light from a window; a color shot of someone's back, shadow-lit and androgynous; a close-up of someone's long, curly hair. I wonder whether the concept (signifiers: the sampled conversation, the song titles, the printed lyrics for the title track) is just about a relationship, or maybe also its collapse. The narrative flow is enthralling, and might be a good opiate during those times. It's the first good 2002 album I've heard, and I didn't even get annoyed at the nautical theme.","If my band was mentioned in Jane magazine's ""Cute Band Alert,"" I'd be worried about looking like some ...

Charity Empressa,Charity Empressa,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5869d034d5c69bf32fe/1:1/w_160/6bbdbc5c.gif,2002-01-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1400-charity-empressa/,Absalom,"The first time I listened to this album, I seriously considered writing this review as a single run-on sentence. This is, after all, music that drones on and on with nary a single bit of punctuation to be found. In fact, on first listen, I didn't make it past the second track. But, as I'm duty-bound to actually listen to everything I review, I spun it again a few days later with the volume up some and it revealed itself to be, well, not so terrible I couldn't take it in one sitting. Seven listens later, I'm a bit divided on what to tell you about Charity Empressa's self-titled debut album. I suppose starting with some background couldn't hurt, so I'll offer this for you to chew on while I gather my thoughts: Charity Empressa is a two-man unit comprised of Eric Campuzano of the Lassie Foundation, assisted by a guy who goes by ""The Frank Lenz Foundation."" They're helped out by a wide-ranging cast of guest vocalists and instrumentalists, though it's never made very clear who contributes what, or even what some of the musicians play. In passing, I'll mention that Charity Empressa are openly and forthrightly Christian, but it barely matters, as only one moment on the whole record even evidences that fact. Charity Empressa begins with a series of layered, vacuum-packed drones and some new age keyboards that are initially rather pleasant. ""This is a nice intro,"" you think, easing back in your chair. The only problem is that an intro needs a song to be a part of, and most introductions aren't over four minutes long. A pall of hazy reverb and drones hangs as though dead, daubed with noodling on the brightly toned keyboard. Even the programmed drum beat that comes in near the end doesn't make it more interesting. Hell, you can't even hear it if you don't have your stereo turned up loud enough. By the time they actually decide to shift the overall texture, you've stopped listening. The shift doesn't really lead to a higher gear, either, and the song just kind of evaporates. Ironically, they've chosen to title the song ""Are We There Yet?"" The second track, ""Carew,"" answers that question by saying, ""No, but here's a trumpet."" Over basically the same foundation, guest trumpeter Matt Fronke does his best 1969 Miles Davis impression, and to his credit, it's the third most interesting thing on the entire album. The main problem occurs when you realize that he isn't really playing much of a theme-- rather, he's simply wandering in a droning wasteland of shimmery texture. Shortened to thirty seconds, this would have made a fine outro to an early Verve b-side, but here it just drags on and on. ""Future King of England"" adds some heavily phased vocals from Wayne Fernandez Everett. Everett's sense of key is interpretive at best, and the whole thing plays largely like a tribute to the haunting vocal break of Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s ""Providence"" slathered in a big, silky drone. It's pretty and all, but why it lasts over six minutes is beyond me, considering that, by then, it's exhausted its welcome three times over. This brings us to the second most interesting moment on this album: the vaguely Eastern ""May the Good Lord Find You."" A steady tabla beat chugs away in the background, marching through a mist of that same drone that covers everything else. Guest vocalist Raquel Munoz offers a decent melody for the first time on the record, and the song is actually short enough not to grow tiresome. Any renewed interest is quickly squelched, however, by ""Give 'Em Hell,"" 10\xBD minutes of drone that services their own title's request. At first, the drone is mixed with some fairly neat static, and somewhat regular hand percussion moves in and out of the background at a few points, but there's virtually nothing to justify the song's length. In the end, the swelling hum comes across about as interesting as an academic demonstration of an early FM synthesizer. ""The Crush of the Mountains"" is only slightly more interesting, and this is due to vocalist Matt Kelly, whose multi-tracked melody saves it from all-out numbing boredom, but does little to contour it. Thankfully, it's followed by what is far and away the best thing Charity Empressa have to offer-- a unique track called ""Shake Your Money Maker."" The song samples a 1939 recording by the Albert Francis Trio of a song called ""The Risen Savior and the Rhythm Maker,"" taken from the Library of Congress archives. At less than three minutes, it's the perfect length, and the backing provided by the band for the sample is unusually vibrant and rhythmic. Funky little bass figures dance around busily tapping rhythms, and the drones, though present, are kept largely to a minimum. Of the remaining four songs, only one stands out at all. ""Stay Gold"" follows the same drone blueprint, adding a little bit of guitar, which inevitably merges with the rest of the background. ""Cool as Cranes"" is an ephemeral wisp of a song buried deep in stationary drones. ""Breathing is Good,"" which is largely the same thing with a female vocalist, is equally brief and inconsequential. Finally, closer ""The Kool Kids and Rok and Roll"" comes in with some strong male vocals, an actual bassline, and some maracas to keep time. Initially, there are no drones at all, and the first one to enter is provided not by big, gauzy, echoing synths, but an organ. The lyrics are quaint, referencing the MC5 and the Rolling Stones and calling on God to bless rock and roll. Of course, by the song's end, it's enveloped once again by big, drony synths, and it ends sounding much like it began-- listless and unobtrusive. And with that the disc is over, and we come to the reason I'm so divided on what to say about this album. I actually like the sound of it a lot, but it never takes that intriguing sound and does enough with it for me. Likewise, I know there are people out there who will lap this up quite enthusiastically. If you're into drone outfits like Stars of the Lid, for example, there's probably a lot to like for you about Charity Empressa. However, for me, this record simply doesn't succeed on most levels. And that's all I've got to say.","The first time I listened to this album, I seriously considered\n\ writing this review as a single run-on sentence ...

Perdition City,Ulver,by: David M.

You know, the ones who hung out at the mall on weekends, drinking Starbuck's coffee and eating McDonald's? Well, Perdition City, the new album from Christophorus G. Rygg and Tore Yiwizaker (aka Ulver) is a lot like that. We're talking lite goth-industrial mixed with smooth-jazz and lame electronic music (the kind so bad it's actually deserving of the derogatory term often used by chain music stores: ""electronica""). In other words, total and utter crap. To be fair, the first few seconds of Perdition City offers some potential. The first track, ""Lost in Moments,"" opens with a driving drum-machine beat heavily treated in reverb, reminiscent of the sort that often found its way into early 70s psychedelia. After about 20 seconds of this, the beat drops out, and it's contrasted with a few sparse piano chords, and random vocals-- likely from an ill-tuned radio-- in the distance. All's well so far. And then comes the saxophone. Guest musician Rolf Erik Nystrom plays sax with the schmaltziest of them, which, to be fair, is a perfect match for the vocals-- would-be-savvy, seductive male crooning that briefly flirts with the idea of carrying the song before mercifully disappearing again. As the sax thankfully leaves with the vocals, the drum machine and piano return. But even, in this new context, they sound plastic and uninspired. By the time the song draws to a close with ominous minor chords, whooshing wind-sounds and a crackly-voiced narration, you have to wonder how anyone's supposed to take this seriously. Even more laughable are the liner notes, which-- if one can wade through the pretentious nonsense like, ""I know now that the underworld is incalculable. To describe it we rely exclusively on tones, sounds, rhythm and pure instrumentality""-- divulge that these guys consider Coil an influence. Excuse me while I retreat to a corner and snicker to myself. Loud enough that people on the other side of the room can hear. What these guys don't seem to realize, is that layering some ""creepy"" vocals (""Ghosts presence/ Ghost music from the radio at night and you can't sleep"") over a vaguely ambient backdrop that sounds like an amateur rendition of ""Who Will Fall"" (as they do on-- snicker snicker-- ""We Are the Dead"") does not make you Coil. It makes you a Coil rip-off. A blatant one. You see, Ulver makes music that is ""dark"" and ""ominous"" without actually posing any legitimate threat, not unlike those two girls you knew back in high school. Really. I can't even begin to comprehend how anyone who listens to Coil could release music this corny and live with themselves. Coil is legitimately frightening. Ulver is frightening like a made-for-TV horror movie is frightening. Ulver makes music for people who want to convince themselves that they dig creepy music without ever having to worry about nervously glancing over their shoulder or feeling their pulse rise. For Christ's sake, on ""Catalept,"" they actually sample Bernard Herrmann's theme from Psycho. Sorry, guys, but after Busta Rhymes uses it, it no longer falls into the ""creepy"" category. Furthermore, the creepiest music in the world generally ceases to be creepy when attached to a drum-machine beat that for all intents and purposes might be named ""Demo."" Still, I'm all about giving credit where credit is due, and I must give Ulver points for variety. According to their website, Rygg and Yiwizaker hail from the Norwegian metal scene, pinning Perdition City as something of a departure from their norm. Even among the tracks on the album, the duo tries out a few different styles. Besides the pseudo-industrial tracks, there's also ""Hallways of Always,"" a lame excursion into the world of Casio-based electronics, and ""Porn Piece or the Scars of Cold Kisses,"" which takes a stab at bad adult-contemporary balladry and disguises it with Casio-based electronics. Who knows? Maybe Perdition City was nothing more than a well-intentioned but ultimately ill-advised experiment for these guys. Maybe, in their more traditional form, Ulver is a really solid metal band. If that's the case, well, you can't blame a band for trying something different. That said, Ulver might want to consider a return to their metal roots. If I want to hear something creepy, I'll stick to the real thing.","Remember those two goth girls you knew back in high school.

Pat was deliciously sarcastic, exhibiting a dune-dry sense of humor and scalpel wit rarely hinted at in his on-air demeanor. Snyder eventually goaded Sajak into telling viewers the stupidest thing he'd ever heard a contestant say. Sajak smiled mischievously and told the story of a woman who, faced with the following puzzle-- ""A_raham _inco_n""-- enthusiastically chirped ""Abraham Bincoln."" Snyder and Sajak had a good chuckle over this, like the Burbank TV bastards they are, and moved on to some vaguely tawdry discussion of Vanna White or something. Anyway, after hearing Psychedelicate for the third or fourth time, it occurred to me that this would be pretty terrible music to listen to before a test, before taking the stand as a witness, or before a job interview. The album's disorientingly lush sound does to your mind what the invisible protagonist of that old Hellen Keller joke does to her living room: walks in, moves shit around, and leaves you bumping misplaced couches and sitting on toilet plungers. If you're not careful it could have you guessing ""Bincoln"" over and over. Yes, Motor City damsels the Slumber Party have put together a lovely codeine- and absinthe-tinged pop platter that should put a stupid, happy smile on your face even as it puts you to sleep. If your mom had been the coolest mom on the block she might have sung you these tunes as lullabies. Alicia Berg's children, if she has any, might someday boast of having had the coolest mom on the block. Her airy voice is the focal point of Slumber Party's music, and her melodies keep things charmingly soporific. Berg's voice is like a less nasal Nico, minus the Euro-accent and thankfully free of that existential misery the Velvets' singer was so obsessed with. Drowsiness is the main side effect of Slumber Party's music-- who'd have thought?-- but there's much for the alert mind to enjoy here. Matthew Smith (of the Volebeats and Outrageous Cherry) produced this reverb-party of an album and his sonic stewardship is even and expert. The album never jars, and one scarcely notices the transitions from kit drums to Casio-beats, instead concentrating on the constant dialogue between Berg's vocal lines and Gretchen Gonzales' meandering guitar work. ""Bag of Spiders,"" and ""Everyone Else I Know,"" the latter of which sounds a bit like a low-budget Stereolab, are the album's standouts. Then again, all the songs are fairly good, if basically interchangeable. The Velvet Underground and the vocal delivery of Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval are the usual sonic touchstones in describing Slumber Party's music. Neither example, however, comes especially close to the mark. There's a bouncy optimism and space to these songs that defy references to older, darker material. So what if the title sounds like one of those insipid ""Before and After"" puzzles on ""Wheel?""","I once saw Tom Snyder interview Pat Sajak.

Sure, the place has a couple of perennially mediocre sports franchises and a yearly drunken redneck gathering disguised as an auto race, but that's about it. It's a place people pass through to get to someplace else. It's also a pretty weak place musically, save for a few stalwart soldiers fighting the good fight. But it wasn't always that way, as this comp attests. No longer should Indy cling to such weak sources of musical renown as ""home of hardcore legends the Zero Boys""-- not when they can lay claim to the Highlighters Band. In fact, the city's visitors bureau and chamber of commerce would play Highlighters' singles in their lobbies if the knew what was up, and they'd have plaques on their walls reading, ""Indianapolis, the city that inspired Bay Area DJ par excellence Peanut Butter Wolf to put together one of the greatest funk comps ever."" The story goes like this: while on a cross-country bowling excursion (that's right) and record search, Wolf stopped in Naptown and was introduced to Highlighters sax player Clifford Palmer. Palmer played Wolf some of his band's old 45s and Wolf was so taken by them that he decided his next project for Stones Throw (his label, which put out Madlib's Quasimoto and Yesterday's New Quintet projects, among others) would be a massive old school funk comp. And it's damn good, compiled with a curator's eye for detail, from the pacing of the tracks to the meticulous liner notes. And what incredible range of styles: hard funk, smooth soul funk, jazz funk, instrumentals, shout-outs, anti-drug anthems, positive ghetto jams, and every kind of post-JB funk you can imagine-- seventy-plus minutes, all recorded between 1968 and 1974 (though most of it's from between '70-'72). To be fair, not all the bands here are from Indianapolis, just the best of the batch. The aforementioned Highlighters give the comp its title with their titular contribution, which tries to out-James Brown James Brown and comes as close as humanly possible. Then there's Billy Ball and the Upsetters featuring Roosevelt Matthews with ""Tighten Up Tighter"" and its supercharged Booker T. groove; the Ebony Rhythm Band, who provide the comp with excellent intro and outro excerpts; and radio DJ-gone-funk-band-leader Spider Harrison with the lurching syncopation of ""Beautiful Day."" Of the non-Indy bands, there are several standouts, but the most surprising is Bad Medicine, made up of a bunch of white guys from upstate New York. Their ""Trespasser"" is what you might call canonical funk: after hearing it, when you hear the word ""funk,"" this will be the sound you imagine. It's pristine and by the books, but dead-on perfect. There are two Texas Bands with killer cuts, too: Dallas' Soul Seven, whose conservatory skills present maybe the hardest, rawest funk of the lot, and Houston's Kashmere Stage Band, who take the big band approach to funk. If there's a problem with The Funky 16 Corners, it's that it's exhausting to listen to all the way through. The energy is kept at such a level that it's best to break it down into two or three sessions-- don't try and take it in all at once.

All Tomorrow's Parties v1.1,Various Artists,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75dea9e61561daa5580/1:1/w_160/40c0f4f8.gif,2002-01-23 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1843-all-tomorrows-parties-v11/,ATP,"I recently succumbed to temptation and purchased one of those Premium Cable Packages, rationalizing it as a vital and illuminating cultural window. As I surfed around, hoping to find something that would truly justify my reasoning (aside from the 40+ cooking channels), I came across Mark Kitchell's Oscar-nominated documentary, Berkeley in the Sixties. Though the film explored a number of topics, its theme seemed to suggest that the counter-culture revolution of the 60s was prone to fail because it lacked a single coherent vision of what the post-revolutionary world should be comprised of. Having no first-hand experience with the 60s, I instead drew parallels from my knowledge of the infinetly more profit-oriented Seattle-wave of the early 90s. Both were adorned with seemingly anti-commercial sentiments which were flagrantly touted and oft-professed, yet rarely put into action, and both seemed to coincide with a burgeoning musical movement. But by the 90s, artists were well aware of the price their insolence afforded them and the few who took up The Cause basically signed their own death warrants. Subtly, advertising, commercialism, and all things counter-productive worked their way from the barroom to the concert hall and, finally, into your local indie venue. Eventually, most artists and clubs were perfectly willing to offer Coke the chance to equate their soda with an enjoyable social event for the right amount of funding. Luckily, as the old guard died away, a line of new blood was slowly consolidating their power; refusing to dilineate between music and politics. A few years ago, Belle and Sebastian, perhaps better known as the thorn in the ass of the industry, took the high-minded ranting of Naomi Klein and Karl Marx to the next level and organized the ""Bowlie Weekender,"" an attempt to remedy the recent corporate transgresses while also avoiding the common pratfalls that seem to marr similar efforts. The ""Bowlie Weekender"" was a three-day festival held in Pontins, Camber Sands, Sussex, where performers of a similar ideology (such as Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Mogwai, the Pastels, the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and Sleater-Kinney) convened with their fans, free of advertisements, press, and all the trappings of a commercial event. When the festival was reprised in 2000, its name had been changed to ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" but the environs and intent remained the same. 2002 will see the marriage of Belle and Sebastian's brainchild with American sensibility as, for three days in March, Los Angeles will be the ironic home of ATP. Now, the orchestrators of that event have independently produced, compiled, and distributed an album featuring primarily rare and unreleased tracks from many of the artists who contributed to the festival. All said, there's something kinda beautiful about the whole thing. The disc commences with Sonic Youth's ""Fauxhemians,"" a musical ode to fellow festival curators, Tortoise. Sonic Youth's decade-spanning knee-jerk reaction to Daydream Nation has left many heads good and scratched and, if you haven't given up on another Dirty, Sister, or Evol yet, accepting the truth is the first step on your road to recovery. The rest of us can sleep a little easier tonight, though, as ""Fauxhemians"" does what NYC Ghosts and Flowers failed to: go somewhere. Similarly, former-punks turned knob-twiddlers Unwound contribute the enthralling ""Behold the Salt,"" a testament to the emotional scope their music has come to encompass since ""Corpse Pose."" So far, there's nothing but an early morning breeze wafting throughout these tracks. Stephen Malkmus makes an appearance with ""Good Kids Egg,"" further cementing his reputation as a bottomless oasis of insightful wit. After ten years, his patented off-kilter voice can still pull off lines like, ""Do what the good kids do/ And screw who the good screw.../ A million of us came here with our pockets turned out."" Elsewhere, Cannibal Ox contributes ""Pidgeon"" off last year's excellent The Cold Vein. Such a diverse selection of styles generally gives rise to needless continuity complications, but in this instance, the dynamic created by the contrasting genres is what lends the album so much of its bent appeal. Stereolab have performed at every ATP since its inception and they're represented here with ""Old Lungs"" which finds the band's more experimental side remarkably healthy (a relief to those who've longed for a return to the days of Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements). Cat Power's cover of the Robert Johnson classic ""Come On in My Kitchen"" finds Chan Marshall's milky vocals breathing a sense of life into lyrics which have had some 80 years to decompose, and Papa M follows suit with the heart-wrenching ""How Can I Tell You I Love You?"" But to say that this disc is a sugary-sweet affair is to miss some of the album's most rewarding tracks. Early on, Bardo Pond indicate that all is not well in the world of ""demographic evasion"" as they indulge in dispensing poetry over a free arrangement of guitar, drums, and bass. But it's the latter half of the disc which features Dead C, the Boredoms, Kevin Drumm, and Satans Tornade unleashing an avant-noise maelstrom of epic proportions that truly makes the album worth owning. Dead C's sonic collage of dissonant mechanical noise, field recordings, abstract flourishes of percussion, and feedback on ""Load Segment"" are all coated with an ethereal reverb, slightly muting what would otherwise be a very confrontational track. Yet, as the disarming ambience of ""Load Segment"" slowly dissolves, the Boredoms begin to interject the peace with shards of skeletal white-noise before establishing the chaotic tribal beat of ""Super Are,"" which sustains its incontinence for over ten minutes only to collapse into the crass and callous arms of Kevin Drumm's ""My Tree Bears No Nuts - Part 2."" Drumm (and likeminded composer, Satans Tornade) work like a more schizophrenic Merzbow, sharply cutting, layering, and varying the tone of their sonic exorcisms, daring the listener to find the hidden rhythm to their madness. All of this can make for a very intense, introspective assault, depending on the listener's level of participation. There's a sense of nihilistic isolation permeating the surface of the songs compiled on All Tomorrow's Parties v1.1. Even the album's happiest moments are mired in feelings of regret or unrequited desire. As records go, it's far above-par and should provide you with hours of consolation and enjoyment. But if the disc is meant to act as a mission statement, its intended message seems to be: stick with Coke, man. You'll be a lot fucking happier.","I recently succumbed to temptation and purchased one of those Premium Cable Packages, rationalizing it as a vital and illuminating ...

L'Incroyable Vérité,Sébastien Tellier,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a750b1335d7bf169901b/1:1/w_160/d71b0473.gif,2002-01-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7966-lincroyable-verite/,AstralwerksRecord Makers,"Sebastien Tellier, a 25-year-old musician from Paris, France, bears an unfortunate physical resemblance to Richard Reid, a 28-year-old shoe-bomber from London, England. Luckily, the resemblance ends with the face. For whereas Reid desires explosive death and destruction, Tellier only desires sleep. Or so it seems. Tellier's debut LP, L'Incroyable Vérité (on Air's new label, Record Makers) aims at sounding lonely. It attains its desired measure of solitude and, regrettably, much, much worse. At first, I thought the opening track, ""Oh Malheur Chez O'Malley"" was the theme music from ""Dr. Who."" This judgment, of course, was patently unfair and premature. Had I exercised patience, I would have realized that, in actuality, it was actually from ""Land of the Lost."" (""Say, Marshall, it's getting dark outside. We'd better get back before the-- fuck, no, not the Sleestaks!!). Aside from not fully understanding what the hell a Sleestak was (the tall, greenish-yellow lizard men that populated the Land of the Lost), fear of them always seemed pitifully irrational to me. Yes, they bull-rushed Marshall, Will and Holly with nocturnal regularity, but can we be sure they intended harm? After all, Sleestaks weren't known for their leaping abilities or cat-like reflexes. Perhaps Sleestaks just liked to give hugs? Can anyone really be sure? Lucky for us, Tellier provides an answer to this stone age mystery towards the end of the album. Sleestaks aside (for the moment), the point remains-- a good chunk of this Frenchman's first LP draws on the anachronistic hues of sci-fi television (and other 60s-70s era theme music, as on the frivolous ""Kazoo III"") including weird organ vamps and rudimentary synth arrangements. The rest of the album bucks the sci-fi thing in favor of arpeggiated acoustic guitar boredom, with ambient clinks and clatter in the background, and occasionally, humming or singing from the artist himself. Tellier sets the machine in motion, and it goes. And goes. And goes. Songs blend together like days in hell. But back to the Staks: The album's high point comes when Tellier appears to answer the aforementioned mystery on ""Trilogie Femme,"" a largely somnolent solo-guitar tune, part of which is oddly reminiscent of the pitter-patter plucking sounds of Bugs Bunny walking on his tippy-toes. But in this case, it's clearly not Bugs-- no, the mood is too dark and foreboding. These are the tones not of the animated thespian, but of the scaly doomsayer. Alas, a woman's chilling screams of horror conclude the tune, and the resolution becomes as clear as crystal gravy: she was killed by Sleestaks! Vicious, tip-toeing Sleestaks! It happens. But besides allowing me several glorious Sleestak references, L'Incroyable Vérité is nearly worthless. Good luck distinguishing lonely Tellier's candlelight drones from one another, and any other element of the powerful emotions he was supposedly aiming for. L'Incroyable Vérité is virtually devoid of melody, climax, or even compelling orchestration, which usually can save slow, moody music like Tellier's. And even though it's not quite as scary as man-eating prehistoric reptiles, L'Incroyable Vérité evokes about the same response: avoidance.","Sebastien Tellier, a 25-year-old musician from Paris, France,\n\ bears an unfortunate physical resemblance to Richard Reid, a\n\ 28-year-old ...

Songs for Cassavettes sdtk,Various Artists,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f05e6ef95969320e65/1:1/w_160/98242648.gif,2002-01-23 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7877-songs-for-cassavettes-sdtk/,Better Looking,"Songs for Cassavetes is a documentary about indie rock, shot on 16mm black-and-white film stock and featuring live show footage of bands largely from Washington, D.C. and/or Washington state. It likely features some live footage, arty, yet organic, camera work, and scenes of witty, articulate, attractively disheveled indie rockers self-consciously mugging at the camera and talking about touring. I say likely because, well, I haven't seen it. The film is currently ""on tour,"" and may be coming to your town soon. It won't be coming to mine, though; I live in rural North Carolina. Thus, my options for catching the film are limited to my coughing up the price of a DVD (no thanks), or waiting for that friendly guy with the dog at Broadway Video to stock it. Am I disappointed? Not really. I mean, I nearly broke my neck trying to see the dismissable Half-Cocked way back in the day, only to learn that Rodan can't act. No surprises. Also, I received (via first class mail), the soundtrack from Songs for Cassavetes, which does, in fact, feature fifteen or so primarily live tracks from bands like Sleater-Kinney, Dub Narcotic Sound System, and the Make-Up. Interspersed throughout are witty, articulate, self-conscious quips from people like Molly Neuman and Calvin Johnson about doing what you love and what happened to the underground in the 90s, which provide nice audio accompaniment to the black-and-white still frames on the cover and the earnest quotations from filmmaker Justin Mitchell in the liners. (Example: ""What follows is the kind of moment one never forgets. You know, the kind that ends up defining a part of your life and that you end up always trying to recapture. For the next ten minutes, you're someplace. It's pretty close to bliss and you know everyone else in the room feels the same thing."") There's no denying the good intentions. And fortunately, Songs for Cassavetes largely avoids falling victim to the typical fate of good intentions. This isn't a sink-or-swim release. And I'd be willing to bet that if you buy this, you have a pretty good idea of what it'll sound like before you even get to the cash register. That, of course, may be a problem-- for a project dedicated to showcasing the innovation of the indie rock scene, there are few risks. I'm betting, for example, that even if you're not a fan, you've heard Sleater-Kinney's ""Words and Guitars,"" and I'll bet you have a pretty good idea of how that sounds live (raw, endearingly unskilled). Likewise, the live version of Unwound's ""Arboretum"" makes a compelling argument for just how tight Unwound is, but doesn't build much on the LP version. The live recording format is even less effective for bands like the Make-Up and Dub Narcotic, whose on-stage success derives in part from the comparative performing charisma of their frontmen. The lesser-knowns put up a good show. Further's ""I Am a Stranger"" is a great little garage-y, retro pop gem whose psychedelic leanings foreshadow certain bandmembers' futures in the Beachwood Sparks. Likewise, Chisel's (featuring the once and future Ted Leo) ""Spectacles,"" which according to liner apocrypha, served as partial genesis for the entire project, has something of a Jawbox feel. I'm not so sure this soundtrack is strong enough to stand alone without knowledge of the film. The soundbytes from the interviews set a tone-- lots of DIY spirit-- and the John Cassavetes quotation that's attributed to ""Everyone"" provides some input as to the chosen title (I was darkly saddened to learn that it was not a collective answer to Le Tigre's ""What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?""). But ultimately, all these bands have stronger material (excepting perhaps the Hi-Fives, whose fizzy, ingratiating ""You Can"" is the clear winner for low point on this CD). Not a bad collection. But unsurprisingly: no surprises.","Songs for Cassavetes is a documentary about indie rock, shot on 16mm black-and-white film stock and featuring live show footage ...

Triptych,The Bevis Frond,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2945e6ef95969320448/1:1/w_160/962ae43d.jpg,2002-01-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/683-triptych/,RubricRubric,"The Bevis Frond emerged fully-formed from the skull of British rock. A cult favorite ever since Nick Saloman created the band in the 80s, it has stayed with a heavy 60s-style psychedelic sound, resisting all Brit-pop fashion and trends. Over the years, the Frond has grown from a one-man band recording in a bedroom to a trio that works in an actual studio; but listening to the first few records-- now back in print thanks to Rubric Records-- it's surprising to hear how little the man has changed. As shown on the Frond's third album, Triptych, Saloman has always had a mature, unpretentious, and frankly, drug-free sensibility. Under all the exotica and period sounds, he makes what is, at its core, meat-and-potatoes rock. Modern audiences can dig the quirks and humor without hearing addled lyrics about how far away the singer's hand looks at the end of his arm. Saloman employs eloquent, left-field imagery to address concrete, sometimes mundane subjects-- getting old, going to court, dealing with the old man who owns the guitar shop-- and his swagger-free voice and genuine English accent lend the wordplay conviction. Every song has a great hook or riff, and Saloman's guitar sears across these lo-fi recordings. The solos jam icicles in your eyeballs. The riffs slam your solar plexus. The few long jams stick to fundamentals and eschew free-form noodling. He sounds like he could go on forever, yet he manages to stop before you feel like checking your watch. Triptych was originally self-released by Saloman in 1988, and he took a few liberties with the recording. He gave his four-year-old daughter a percussion feature; she's okay. He invited his mum to sing on his cover of ""Hey Joe""; she's brilliant. (Only David Letterman has put a mother to better use in the service of art.) On the other hand, the two instrumentals just fill space-- album opener ""Into the Cryptic Myst,"" a bland relic that does nothing but set the mood, and ""Phil Exorcises the Daemons,"" a short piece with drummer Phil Collyer that never takes off. Around those tangents sit some of the Frond's best pop songs. ""Lights Are Changing"" rides on a Byrds-like riff and a catchy chorus. Mary Lou Lord almost had a hit with her cover of this song, but her glossy, nice-girl spin on the tune can't compare to this raw original, where Saloman pushes his vocals higher than they can comfortably go. It's followed by more fine retro-pop: Saloman splays killer riffs and a two-guitar attack across ""Gemini Machine"" and ""Nowhere Fast,"" while the ballads ""Old Man Blank"" and ""Corinthian"" have gentle vocals and classic flower power organ lines. The album closes with ""Hey Joe"" and six catchy but inessential bonus tracks. They're a breath of cool air after the centerpiece of the album: ""Tangerine Infringement Beak,"" a twenty-minute one-man jam session that Saloman plays like the Four Horsemen of Garage Rock. Sprawling and unruly, it treads perilously near total indulgence-- but closer inspection reveals that the song is neatly organized into sections and paced for maximum effect. And when Saloman runs out of lyrics, he admits it and segues to the three-minute organ/noise coda. Very sensible.","The Bevis Frond emerged fully-formed from the skull of British rock.

"Hands in the Estuary, Torso in the Lake",Black Cat Music,by: Daphne Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d25e6ef959693204e7/1:1/w_160/bd3f8316.gif,2002-01-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/744-hands-in-the-estuary-torso-in-the-lake/,Lookout!,"Before there was Iggy, there was Jim. In the much recounted story, Iggy was still a jazz nerd when he saw the Doors play at Michigan State's homecoming weekend dance. Morrison, drunk and angry, berated the thicknecks while pouring his loudest, most annoying caterwauls over the din of his backing band. Unfortunately, Iggy's Stooges didn't have the chops to cut their blues so mean, instead turning to the frantic diatribes of nonsense and noise that would become punk. That early flirting with sensuality, Freud, and slightly hokey (if atmospheric) leanings towards magic still resonates across America, though it isn't so popular in the underground. The music, like Morrison in his last days, is commonly referred to as ""bloated."" It is therefore with some grace that Black Cat Music summon the bravado, free-associative linguistics, and raw confidence of the Doors. Granted, this is just one of many Doors references made in a sea of post-Doors reviews, but it's among the most overt with the shimmery, back-door blues pouring so effortlessly from these guys' hands. From Berkeley, Black Cat Music includes members of the Criminals and the Receivers, and here, they reclaim the long-forgotten glam overtones first defined in Kim Fowley's version of west coast punk. From the first moment Travis Dutton's guitar brands the songs as gin-fueled, metallic based grit, there's no pauncy apologies or ironic doublespeak-- just curl-ended phrases of instruments and vocals working at first in opposition, then in chorus. Songs like ""The Chain-Snatcher"" borrow from the Gun Club's proto-hair pompousness in a way no east coast band ever could. ""Most Perfect Day, Ever"" undercuts this with an acoustic rhythm track and subtle, double-tracked background vocals indicative not so much of radio production as that of a precise studio mind. Still, the Svenonius-like swagger of singer Brady (no last name) takes on earnest, sometimes cliched sentimental properties without a hint of that disaffection so obvious in Nation of Ulysses or any of the new breed of political post-punkers. It's as if Black Cat Music, projecting the sonic nihilism of their ancestors, can't help but wake to the sunshine and expect it all to come out alright. Black Cat Music's genuflection at the glam-gone-metal mindset, coupled with Brady's husky vocals, also manages to make room for lovely moments like ""The Dirty Penny,"" a song whose dark, Spanish turns recall Eric Burdon's Animals while standing firmly in the timeless world of slammin' solos and slick studios. That said, this isn't progress so much as a re-envisioning of history-- one where Morrison never sizzled out, where Iggy's gutter antics still smacked of glitter, and where the politics of the Threat and the Flag were just so much white kid, middle-class jive.","Before there was Iggy, there was Jim.

Labor Days,Aesop Rock,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01c13d19756521382dc/1:1/w_160/57ae5a4e.gif,2002-01-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/65-labor-days/,Definitive Jux,"Your humble reviewer is not hugely invested in the state or the fate of hip-hop. A lot of folks are, though, sometimes to an unfortunate extent-- hip-hop spends almost as much time drawing lines and fighting over its own image as the punk and hardcore zines do, albeit more entertainingly. One of the results of this is that a whole lot of hip-hop records are basically about hip-hop: the mainstream stuff (aka ""real"" hip-hop) offers up further meta-explorations of a few MC-persona archetypes, while the undie stuff (aka ""real"" hip-hop) dedicates itself to the Ancient Skillz of crate-digging, battle rhyming, and either picking on the mainstream or spitting abstract jumbles of wordplay. The former is how we get stuff like P. Diddy saying, ""I don't write rhymes, I write checks""; the latter is how we get stuff like the Anti-Pop Consortium, who sound godlike in ten second snippets but prove mind-numbingly tedious by fifteen. Aesop Rock is one of those MCs who have stumbled upon a blindingly intelligent solution to this state of affairs: he's ignored all of that baggage and made a record that's mostly about something. That something is work. Labor-- effort in its broadest sense-- is a topic he treats sometimes pedantically but often more thought-provokingly than not only the bulk of hip-hop, but the bulk of any genre. It helps that Labor Days is as terrific a record as anyone could ask for, really, and you should buy it, and here's why. First: Aesop Rock is a terrific MC. His flow is rapid but clear; his interjections, double-time verses and sing-song bits are arranged with near-symphonic skill. He's also calm and confident, avoiding both the egomaniacal swagger of a lot of mainstream and the egomaniacal jerkiness of a lot of underground, while nicking their finer points as well. Better than that: Aesop Rock's flow is brilliant, a combination of mindbending wordplay (""Who am I?"" he asks, then answers: ""Jabberwocky Superfly!""), in-rhymed poetics (""You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags""), and surgically sharp, eye-rolling dismissals of anyone he disapproves of: ""If you had one more eye you'd be a cyclops,"" runs one, ""which may explain your missing the premise."" Aesop Rock says more astoundingly intelligent things per minute than the entire combined rosters of a lot of other labels. Second: Blockhead, who produces much of this record, does an equally terrific job. Labor Days is bound for constant comparisons to Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein, the other Def Jux Edgy Intelligent NYC MCs with Stark Progressive Beats record to crop up on 2001's year-end lists. And while the comparisons are valid ones, lyrically and often sonically, Labor Days differs by trading in The Cold Vein's minimalist grind for an equally minimal but remarkably lush, cinematic spread of subtly weaving beats and sinuous, somber, minor-key instrumental arrangements that sound as if someone has been doing his crate-digging in the klezmer, bouzouki, and koto piles of the ""World Classical"" section. ""Daylight,"" the record's initial standout, works from a long, plush melodic loop with a wood flute sighing over it (there are a lot of woody flutes on this record-- enough to make you wonder if Blockhead wouldn't have done a better job than RZA on the Ghost Dog soundtrack). Meanwhile, ""Save Yourself,"" the record's real standout, consists of a slow-motion lope constructed from staccato bass blips, an east-Mediterranean guitar pluck, and wispy female cooing. ""Battery"" stretches the limits of hip-hop pastoralism with a bass-and-cello figure and more of those fluttering coos with Ace intoning, ""Brother sun, sister moon, mother beautiful,"" and, ""I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids."" If most hip-hop chases a futuristic, brightly lit city vitality, Labor Days is laid out peacefully on a rainy plain somewhere. And if The Cold Vein sounds like the grind of inscrutable machinery, Labor Days waits a couple hundred years for those machines to be covered with moss and vines. When it all comes together, on ""9-5ers Anthem""-- a track which pairs a sprightly bassline with handbells (handbells!) with Ace in top form, spitting out brilliant parallel metaphors for quotidian employment-- it seems so all-consumingly right: hip-hop bouncing confidently along, actually saying something about something, and saying it well and smartly. Aesop Rock does have a message here, which you'd expect to be a bad thing but isn't, really, insofar as the message is a pretty reasonable one. Ace's message is that life can be hard but that's all the more reason to shut your mouth and work on something that makes you happy. Essentially. Labor Days gets cartoonish only once, on ""No Regrets,"" which is still a decent and sensitive track but which we won't really get into here because on the other hand, it's the inherent pragmatism of Ace's theme that allows for his wonderfully apologetic complaints about 9-5 employment. Not to mention all those glorious eye-rolling disses: ""Keep me posted,"" he says, ""as to when you grasp something mature to sit and soak about, Mister, and I'll consider picking up your record."" That last line's from ""Save Yourself,"" which collects Ace's comments on the How We Do Hip-Hop question-- he's undie, of course, here with his sonically progressive Def Jux release, so clearly he's going to drop some invective on this Important Issue. His take, though? Forget it: ""Maybe you ought to try saving something other than hip-hop,"" insightful advice no matter what genre you insert at the end. ""Pistons pump perfect,"" he says, then, ""what you're holding ain't really broken."" And for the duration of Labor Days, it's pretty clear that in the hands of someone with something to use it for, it's not, not at all.","Your humble reviewer is not hugely invested in the state or the fate of hip-hop.

Mood Bells,Cylob,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cac0084474cd0c0a4a/1:1/w_160/3fee56ce.gif,2002-01-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1705-mood-bells/,Rephlex,"Most things don't change. Time passes and ideas about things change, but the actual nature of things stays pretty much the same. This is a phenomenon that, while never a popular train of thought among the super-hip and tuned-in, is almost always the final resting place for great thinkers and your grandparents alike. And of course, there's a constant, subversive debate over whether or not this is really the case. Some people will say that the idea of a static environment is contrary to the nature of culture and, in fact, nature itself. And then there's the issue of evolution, both theoretical and biological. These are all heavy philosophical arguments, but if you just ask your grandparents, you'll find that, in actuality, nothing has changed, and if anything, the state of the world is regressing. Now this debate becomes extra troublesome for us, the people who care about music above all other concerns, because often, the appearance of ""not changing"" is viewed negatively. You need look no further than Pitchfork's review archive to find that informed music thinkers often dismiss the new when it isn't. Chiefly, when an artist seems not to have advanced to the next square in the music game, the artist risks being accused of ""resting on his laurels,"" or worse, making the reviewer bored. And as we all know, a bored music critic is a crime against nature. I don't have a big problem with stuff staying the same, at least to a point. After all, if artists didn't go back to their roots (as if they had a choice), they'd never be able to build upon them. England's Cylob (aka Chris Jeffs) is building on roots with Mood Bells. To my ears, he's playing either ambient or new age music here, and though neither of those terms may leave the best of impressions on some listeners, they're certainly valid avenues of expression. Yes, I think the music here could have come from the 70s, 80s or 90s, and perhaps that means it's not a revolutionary concept in art, but it's also not a real criticism in my opinion. What will warrant criticism is dependent on your reaction to those roots-- do you like new age? So, with that out of the way, let's proceed with the album at hand. ""Tamtam Intro"" begins the album with no hint of irony, as it's essentially a gong splash. And that's it. The next tune is ""Majorette,"" which is a meditative figure played on bells. It's quite short (as are all the songs on Mood Bells), and features no embellishment or variation on the figure. It's the kind of music that I would play as a soundtrack to staring, because there aren't any bumps in the road or rough transitions. If that sounds like a compliment, then chances are you will like this record. If not, stay tuned. ""China Gong"" introduces a couple of new timbres, chiefly that of, well, a high-pitched Chinese gong (like you hear in Chinese opera), and some kind of metallic mallet instrument. This isn't so much a song as a vignette of percussive textures. ""Dark Days"" brings in a scalar melody, but keeps the instrumentation from the previous tune intact. Sometimes the pitches shift up or down unnaturally, like you can do on keyboards with the little pitch-shifter handle, though apparently, they are honest-to-god bells, if a bit manipulated digitally. ""Sun-day"" introduces more familiar synthlines, and perhaps wouldn't sound out of place on Björk's last album-- however, Björk would probably use this kind of thing for an intro, and then begin a proper song. Again, Cylob's music on this album is more effective as disembodied ambience than active listening experience, so it's probably best not to go in expecting fireworks. The only tune that features so much as a beat is ""Snowing,"" though it is suitably restrained. Fans of Cylob's previous ambient techno stuff will probably enjoy this release, but then fans of Cylob's previous, more rambunctious material (especially stuff like 1997's Cylob's Latest Effort EP) may be put off by the sheer passiveness of the music. I couldn't really call myself a fan of near-beatless ambient, per se, but by the same token, this disc did make a great companion to writing and just looking out of my window last weekend.","Most things don't change.

Incidentally, how do you know that? HAPLESS REVIEWER: I typed their name into a search engine and ""Dawson's Creek"" showed up. HER CONSCIENCE: Oh. Is it any good? HAPLESS REVIEWER: I dunno. A little contrived. Hard to believe they really sound like that naturally-- the girl, in particular. I could see how it might be a guilty pleasure, and I'm guessing the fanbase is predominately female. But personally, I think it's kind of boring, and a little too self-consciously precious for its own good. HER CONSCIENCE: Are you talking about the show? HAPLESS REVIEWER: Oh, god, no. The band! Rilo Kiley. From Los Angeles. HER CONSCIENCE: How does it sound? HAPLESS REVIEWER: Well, you can hear it for yourself. This is the first song, ""Go Ahead."" It has that airy, finger-picked folk thing going on. Pretty, I guess, but the most typical chord progression in the world. And the girl-- Jenny Lewis-- sings in that breathy, pouty little girl way favored by far too many female singer/songwriters these days. I hate that. She adds backing harmonies to give herself a little more substance, but it's hard to take someone seriously when they sing, ""If you wanna have your cake and eat it, too/ And if you want to have other people watch while you eat it/ Go ahead."" It's not quite campy enough to be twee. Like, it's a tad more upbeat than Ida, but less interesting musically. HER CONSCIENCE: That's not a compliment, is it? HAPLESS REVIEWER: Not really, no. And I feel sort of bad pointing this out. Rilo Kiley is kind of a new band and all, but this sounds really amateurish. ""Pictures of Success"" could be a prom band doing Ida, with all the problems that implies. You know, the questionable sound quality, slightly out-of-tune instrumentation (including a completely irrelevant trumpet line at the end), over-articulated vocals, and an unnatural gentleness that makes you feel a little bit embarrassed. (Pause) Jenny Lewis' vocals really drive me crazy. HER CONSCIENCE: Well, what about this other singer? HAPLESS REVIEWER: Yeah, that's Blake Sennett. He sounds a lot like Elliott Smith, but not as good. Still, it's an improvement over the girl. Otherwise, this song is fairly dismissable. You know how some bands can take the whole 60s lite-pop sound and subvert it to amusing and/or ironic effect? Not these kids. It's like Muzak! The Beatles-esque business on ""Small Figures in a Vast Expanse"" isn't so bad, I guess-- I think the guitars sound better there than they usually do. And I actually find that I don't mind Jenny Lewis' vocals so much when they're overdubbed as backing vocals. HER CONSCIENCE: Have we heard this song before? HAPLESS REVIEWER: No. It just sounds the same. Except track ten, ""Always."" It's not a bad song. I like the new wave intro. I like how over-the-top pop it is, and that it's comparatively loud. Reminds me of Velocity Girl, back in the day. And I'm inclined to believe this is the direction Rilo Kiley should take. But still. HER CONSCIENCE: You're going to make fun of them, aren't you? For that ""Dawson's Creek"" business... HAPLESS REVIEWER: It's such a temptation. It's not worth it, though. I can't get a good dig in at Rilo Kiley because they're not bad enough to warrant my ire. I'm not offended, just bored. The worst thing I could say is that this is forgettable and any humor I may find in their connection to ""Dawson's Creek"" will do little more than remind me of who they are.","SETTING: Small office in small apartment in small, provincial town.

Love Is Here,Starsailor,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5505e6ef95969320a91/1:1/w_160/a7ffc1cd.jpg,2002-01-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7479-love-is-here/,Capitol,"You've got your daddy's eyes. And your daddy was an alcoholic. I've got something in my throat. I need to be alone, when I suffer. So wipe the makeup from your face, tie your hair and gently fall from grace. Give me a call; when you're so sensitive, it's a long way to fall. You fell from my view. Son, you've got a way to fall. Let me stay while they all fall to the ground. There's an outlaw on the highway-- and she's falling. And she's falling. If it sounds like I've stumbled onto someone's LiveJournal account, it's because James Walsh's lyrics read like a diary. And believe me, dear reader, when I tell you that each of the sentences above is from one of his songs. Of the eleven tracks on Love Is Here, Starsailor's debut album, more than half mention the world ""fall"" in some tense. Strange, too, because in interviews, Walsh has mentioned that the album title was chosen for its positivity, in the light of the cynicism they feel in the world around them. Yet, there's no doubt that Starsailor's Q-mag accolades and their trip up the charts has been influenced by Coldplay, Travis and those other melancholy radiorock bands from their native England. Walsh's voice, for his part, makes and breaks the band. His wavering baritone doesn't sound much like a twenty-year-old, though it does bear an uncanny similarity at times to both Live's Ed Kowalcyzk and David Gray. But his bandmates play foil to his ambition with the simplicity of their arrangements; James Stelfox's bass and Ben Byrne's drums create a vaguely soulful backbeat, and Barry Westhead's keyboards add ornamentation, swelling during the inevitably overblown climax of each song. Producer Steve Osbourne should probably get credit as the fifth bandmember; his work with the Happy Mondays to Curve to Paul Oakenfold has given him the experience to craft a truly special sound here, lush and yet conveying an acoustic atmosphere. If only Walsh & Co. knew such subtlety. The energy and emotion in these ballads comes across a hell of a lot more sincere than the Matchbox Twenties of the world, but Starsailor err so far on the opposite end that you're beaten about the ears. On the afore-referenced ""Alcoholic,"" Walsh whines, ""Don't you know you've got your daddy's eyes/ your daddy was an alcoholic/ But your mother kept it all inside/ And she threw it all away."" The sharp piano chords mix with his voice like a long-lost Journey tear-jerker, and you know you can expect the entrance of the drums just as the second verse begins. And Walsh's delivery, sounding so deliberate and forced, doesn't do the track any favors. ""Tie Up My Hands,"" the opener, plods forward with soft bass and softer bass drum, and it's a nice enough lure. But Walsh adopts this nursery-rhyme vocal hook: ""Take the disaffected life/ Men who ran the company ran your life/ You could have been his wife."" He wants to be the tragic hero so bad, and the chorus blazes with dramatic guitarwork while he reels off: ""I wanna hold you but my hands are tied/ I wanna stay here but I've been denied!"" He is pretty hunky, I have to admit, but Bono's ego stole the same earnest rockstar pose long ago and forever doomed his followers to imitation. Plus, you really can't forgive lyrics like, ""She just wept/ Like I could not ignore/ How can I act/ When my heart's on the floor?"" If Walsh didn't steal the scene so much, you might notice the other musicians' contributions more often. The constant acoustic strum and piano progressions on ""Poor Misguided Fool"" near Tindersticks territory, and in the middle of ""Talk Her Down,"" the guys bust into this beautiful, churning wreck of a breakdown, keyboards swirling and cymbals crashing. Love Is Here isn't bad, and its prospect for radio play is far more appealing than, say, Train. The four just don't have the depth of their admitted influences-- Neil Young, Van Morrison and Tim Buckley (the band is named after one of his albums)-- though they have much room for growth. Most of the songs sound too similar: a brooding verse matched by a bombastic chorus, and Walsh's ""fall"" imagery doesn't seem so much conceptual as it does repetitive. Occasionally, as on the closer ""Coming Down,"" Walsh hushes his voice into intimacy as he asks, ""Were you always coming down?"" But usually it's the most blatant of dashboard confessionals: ""Daddy, I've got nothing left/ My life is good/ My love's a mess."" People get onto indie rock for being inaccessible, but I'll take Pavement's ""latent causes, sterile gauzes and the bedside morale"" any day over Starsailor's ""there's a hole inside my boat, and I need to stay afloat, for the summer."" Maybe Starsailor will hit it big here in the post-September-11th U.S., as they did in the U.K.; they've got that whiny doleful sensitivity that appeals to the masses. But I don't get the cathartic release they're aiming for. Instead, I just feel like falling.","You've got your daddy's eyes. And your daddy was an alcoholic. I've got something in my throat ...

Stands for Decibels/Repercussion,The dB's,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c25e6ef959693212a6/1:1/w_160/ab420cf2.jpg,2002-01-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11718-stands-for-decibelsrepercussion/,Collector's ChoiceCollector's Choice,"Every time a great pop band bombs, the fans and critics scratch their heads and wonder why. The Beatles became the biggest rock group in history, but their offspring-- from Big Star to XTC to the dB's-- barely touched the charts. How can you not win with music so upbeat, accessible, and inventive? Those hooks, those great guitar licks... But it's important to remember that no band, no matter how good, has a birthright to stardom. Guitar-heavy pop music hasn't gotten anybody laid since the sixties. You can dance to it, but you sure as hell can't neck to it. The musicians aren't even sexy. Look at the Beatles, and then pull out a photo of Big Star and try to pick ""the cute one."" The bands hoped to conquer the school proms and teeny boppers, but Big Star's Alex Chilton later speculated on their true fanbase: ""I think it just sorta strikes a resonant chord with people who are in the same boat [as we were]-- you know, confused, twenty-year-old college students with a guitar in their hands."" Would I rather hear these bands at the Super Bowl halftime show? Sure, but we're stuck with Aerosmith. So it goes. The dB's, an early-to-mid-80s southern jangle pop band from Winston-Salem via New York City, got more bad breaks than most. Poor record sales kept them from building an audience. The albums on this two-for-one reissue CD-- Stands for deciBels and Repercussion-- weren't even released in the States until after the band broke up. dB Peter Holsapple has said that back when he worked at a record store, he steered customers to XTC and Squeeze albums because his own band's imports cost too much, proving once again that there is no karma in rock. Yet, the band were always critical favorites, and played a major part in spawning the ""jangle-pop"" sound later perfected by R.E.M. and Mitch Easter's Let's Active. Atop their two-guitar line-up, the dB's experiment with keyboards and effects, firing rounds of world class hooks at fans' feet and daring them not to pogo. And all this while retaining such a distinct sound; unlike many guitar-pop bands of the time, the dB's preferred a live, unpolished sound to glossy 80s production. While lead singers and songwriters Holsapple and Chris Stamey didn't exactly have the strongest voices, they knew how to wrap their vocals around a catchy line, and more importantly, how to sing about a girl like they meant it. On Stands for deciBels, Holsapple writes the more straight-ahead tunes-- the flawless ""Big Brown Eyes,"" or the 50s-angst number ""The Fight."" Stamey, meanwhile, contributes the quirky-almost-spastic numbers like ""Cycles Per Second,"" and scores the album's most heartfelt moment on ""I'm in Love"": his voice almost breaks as he belts out, ""I don't understand."" On the cleaner-sounding, more mature Repercussion, Holsapple's songs are more dire, but they always manage to maintain catchiness-- the album's single, ""Amplifier,"" famously discusses suicide with clever lyrics over an unwaveringly bouncy pop backing. As Holsapple turned serious, Stamey delivered ridiculously catchy songs like ""Ask for Jill,"" where he reenacts being turned down via telephone. Repercussion suggests a developing band and a terrific songwriting partnership. But soon after, MTV rejected the video for ""Amplifier"" because of the suicide theme, Stamey quit the band, and more bad luck kept their next albums from doing much better than the first. In interviews and the liner notes to this disc, the dB's sound resigned to their near-miss with success, and imagine if they had started out today: ""'kay guys, our research says the kids want Christian rock bands that don't actually talk about God. How long can you grow your hair?"" But as I set this disc next to my other cult band reissues, I think about what Alex Chilton once said about his career: ""Somewhere along the line I figured out that if you only press up one hundred copies of a record, then eventually it will find its way to the one hundred people in the world who want it the most."" Watching the dB's fans-- from the early college DJs who managed to find these albums, to the niche labels who reissue them today-- it's reassuring to find that Chilton was right.","Every time a great pop band bombs, the fans and critics scratch their heads and wonder why.

They Raging. Quiet Army,Detachment Kit,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b974ea9e61561daa6fbf/1:1/w_160/c6f26639.jpg,2002-01-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2295-they-raging-quiet-army/,Self-Starter Foundation,"I love the scene. By ""the scene,"" I mean music, and the people who love it. Of course, one overarching scene doesn't really exist-- more correctly, there are hundreds of little scenes, each of which contributes its own part to a greater whole. The most common scene demarcation, for obvious reasons, is geography. A bunch of bands and their fans in one city become a scene over time, and in the right hands, it nurtures creativity and collaboration. Of course, when you've got several regional scenes, rivalries begin to creep in over time. These rivalries are usually nothing more than the imagined creations of a few fans or journalists, but on occasion, they spread to the business or (rarely) to the musicians themselves. Apparently, the rivalry between the New York and Chicago scenes has become real enough that New York's Self-Starter Foundation makes a big deal over the fact that the Detachment Kit are a ""rare good band from Chicago"" on their website, regarding the band's signing. Regardless of your opinion of the Chicago scene (which we here at Pitchfork most certainly do not have a problem with; as our readers are fond of noting, it's quite the opposite), it's hard to argue with the fact that the Detachment Kit sounds a lot more like a New York band than a Chicago one. Their jerky, often melodic, and occasionally even anthemic post-punk would sound right at home coming off the stage at CBGB on a bill with some Rhode Island School of Design alumni. In fact, the Detachment Kit frequently sound as though they could be Les Savy Fav's younger brothers playing in their own band on their debut, They Raging. Quiet Army. Guitarist/vocalist Ian Menard comes across as something of a more melodic Tim Harrington, while the rest of the band has their way with all manner of rhythmic interplay. However, the band manages to distance themselves enough from Les Savy Fav that their music doesn't begin to sound like pale imitation. On their own terms, the Detachment Kit are an agile band that show a great deal of promise. The band doesn't really turn in a single bad song here, though a few stand especially tall above the crowd. ""Yourself: A Majesty of Infinite Space"" overflows with energy, opening with canonical screaming and launching headlong into frenzied guitar lines and syncopated drumming that pay tribute to yet another scene: D.C. Menard's multi-tracked voice is reminiscent of a less demented sounding Guy Picciotto, spewing lines like, ""Now start the damage/ Start the sound."" ""Hurricane Designed for People"" follows with stuttering verses and a kinetic sledgehammer of a chorus packed with piledriving bass and drums. ""11.22.63"" typifies the Les Savy Fav comparison perhaps better than any other song on the album, with its slow start, building to the explosive screaming of the chorus, where Menard's similarity to Harrington is more obvious than ever. Even the guitar tones bear a certain resemblance to LSF's ""Hide Me from Next February."" Guitarist Charlie Davis III is fond of playing snaking countermelodies and aggressive leads with his guitar covered in trebly distortion. His leads on the opener, ""High Seas,"" are especially brash, full of huge note bends, and they cut through with slashing chords. The band's own production gives the album a rather dry, direct feeling, which works well for the most part. It especially suits the mathy guitar parts and remarkably restrained singing on ""Sitting Still, Talking About Jets,"" a song that could easily drown if treated to too much reverb. Unfortunately, the song's linear structure leaves it a bit unsatisfying, as though there should have been another verse at the end. ""The Euphio Question"" provides a nice contrast to the other songs with its relatively simple arrangement, slow pace, and e-bow guitar lines bordering on pretty. The vocal melody isn't quite as strong, though, and Josh Hight's melodic bass part actually ends up stealing the show for most of the song. ""Never Hear Your Words"" is even sparser, dispensing entirely with the muscular rhythmic backing that drives the rest of the album entirely at first, before building to a thunderous bridge. Menard coats the whole song in a rich melody that proves one of his most compelling. ""Another Great Champion Sought, Thought, and Died"" follows a similar formula, beginning with quietly creeping verses over a steady kick drum and droning bass. The intensity gradually builds and recedes as Menard alternates between melodic singing and agitated shouting. Finally, the song bursts into processed hardcore shouting and stuttering, guttural guitar riffs at the 4\xBD-minute mark. This raging climax ultimately gives out, though, leaving the song to end with a brief passage of quiet, clean-toned guitar and subtle bass strumming. The album closes with ""The Illustrious Daniel Boone: Pioneer of Social Ingenuity,"" which changes things up by crashing in noisily before calming for the verses. Davis' e-bow finds its way back into the mix as well, arcing about behind Menard in the first few verses before making its final exit. The song unfortunately can't quite support itself for its full 6\xBD minutes, occasionally falling into listless passages that aren't convincing enough melodically or rhythmically. It's a fairly minor disappointment, though, coming at the end of an album with quite a few highlights. They Raging. Quiet Army is a strong debut when taken as a whole, though the band definitely has a little cleaning up to do here and there. The Detachment Kit have proven that they have the range it takes to someday make a truly great record, and perhaps with another guiding hand, such as an outside producer, they should be able to do it soon. For now, though, let's just say they've done their city proud and leave it at that.","I love the scene. By ""the scene,"" I mean music, and the people who love it. Of\n\ course, one ...

Weekday,Carpet Musics,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53013d1975652138eb5/1:1/w_160/9e9816aa.jpg,2002-01-21 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1316-weekday/,Audio DregsAudio Dregs,"I can't really play the piano, but I do know the basic I, IV and V chords. When I find myself in front of a keyboard and I'm with people who can't play, it's fun to improvise a little melody on this foundation. I just do a walking bassline with my left hand and hit some random notes that fit with the chords with my right. If I play slowly, the little tune that spins out has an impressive melancholic quality, considering the complete lack of skill and talent that went into it. Idyllictronic (Ryan, make that royalty check out to Simon Reynolds) bedroom producers Carpet Musics, consisting of Oregonians Eric Diaz and Eric Mast, realize the strength that comes from simplicity. The 14 tracks on their debut, Weekday, are filled with these basic chord progressions, gently tapped on dreamy synthesizers and guitars set to ""ambient,"" with just a hint of distortion to reflect recent trends in glitch. These tiny music box tunes are quite effective in their own modest way, and the record as a whole sustains a mood and is consistently enjoyable. Still, there's something just a bit too polite about Weekday, and the lack of tension keeps it from being great, or even particularly memorable. No, it's definitely not Top 10 material, though there are certain situations where this record would be perfect. A gray day when your friends are out of town, you're just getting over the flu, and you're too broke to buy any new records would be the perfect time to hear ""Dawn,"" a track which reminds me of a stripped-down demo for Schneider TM's ""The Light 3000"" (sans vocals). The minute-long ""Bathrobe"" has a palpable sadness, not unlike some of the short transitional bits on Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children. ""Afternoon"" is a continuation of the earlier ""Noon,"" a track with fingerpicked electric guitar and some gurgling synths that transforms itself into a dystrophic (and adorable) techno rhythm about 2\xBD minutes in, reminiscent of Nobukazu Takemura's work as Child's View. It's an ideal track for relaxing on the couch as the sun fades away and you continue to wait for the mailman to bring that promised package of promo CDs. And ""Fashion Magazine,"" with its 4/4 house thump and a Cluster-ized melody ripped from the Schlammpeitziger fakebook, would set the mood for a shared cup of tea in a sunny kitchen, a respite to talk intimately about the latest Sonig releases. There's not a thing wrong with functional music, and that's how this record strikes me. So while Weekday keeps me at arm's length emotionally, it works so well as background that it's worth keeping around.","I can't really play the piano, but I do know the basic I, IV and V chords.

Skyscraper National Park,Hayden,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c07eabf31b7dc7156486/1:1/w_160/788fa7fc.jpg,2002-01-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3772-skyscraper-national-park/,Badman,"In terms of population, Canada (31 million) has New York (8 million) beat by a long shot. But in an ode to the capitalist spirit of efficiency, New Yorkers have accomplished a stunning feat of people-packing; while Canadians bogart a whopping 3.8 million square miles of the continent, New Yorkers shoehorn themselves into a mere 320. That's 25,000 New Yorkers per square mile versus a lonely 8 per square mile in the Great White North. For New Yorkers, this means doubling-up, living in closets, and moving to Hoboken. For Canadians, it means just the opposite: solitude. And a plethora of moose (one of which stars on Hayden's album cover). Canadian Hayden Desser's sounds of solitude have captured the ears of sad-core indie-folk fans ever since his debut LP, Everything I Long For, was released in 1996. The album, recorded on a four-track at his parent's house, was notable for its contrast of wistful tenderness and snarling anger, and of course, Hayden's striking baritone. On its follow-up, The Closer I Get, Hayden had less to growl about, but just as much to long for, finding its high points with ""Two Doors"" and ""Between Us to Hold."" Now, after a three-year hiatus, Hayden has returned with his third LP, Skyscraper National Park. The album casts Hayden as older, wiser and more reflective. Hayden is still a man steeped in his own sensitivity, but he's changed a bit with age. Youthful, idealistic romance has grown into love, hopefulness into doubt, and anger into distance. Accompanying his maturity is a newfound and uncanny sense of restraint that both binds the disc and renders his passion haunting and compelling. Not once does Hayden burst into a growl. Instead, the album is marked by frequent reliance on a simple falsetto. Hayden's progression is apparent from the opening chords of ""Street Car,"" faint and filtered, with audible squeaks and shimmers of Hayden's fingers on the fretboard of his 12-string. A piano joins only on downbeats, and both play an ideal forum for Hayden's forlorn lyrics: ""Parked underground the night you left/ It took me an hour and a half/ To find my way back up above/ There's nothing up there without your love."" ""Dynamite Walls"" is as close Hayden has come to perfecting his craft. The song features an uptempo beat (for Hayden) and a full band, dwelling on fresh, spacious instrumentation and a subdued melody, until it releases into a magnificent crescendo. The lyrics, including the chorus (""Miles away, just up ahead/ It doesn't matter just what/ Any of us is looking for/ We'll never find it because/ It's not even there"") are a shockingly precise complement to the music, conjuring images of driving through open spaces and mountain air. After ""Dynamite Walls,"" Skyscraper National Park levels into a sonic consistency of subdued melodies and sparse instrumentation. ""All in One Move"" is one of cheeriest tunes on the album, so much so that it can properly be called a ""tune."" Not surprisingly for sad-man Hayden, at about one minute in length, it's also the shortest song on the disc. So before he manages to lift himself out of depression, he regresses into ""Bass Song,"" featuring lyrics as genial and optimistic as, ""I couldn't find shit/ So I grabbed my bass guitar by the neck/ And held it above me/ And hid by the top of the stairs and that's where I was found/ Five days after I hit the ground."" Hayden closes the album nicely with ""Lullaby,"" less melody-focused than the rest of the album, and more akin to the mood music of such slow-core stalwarts as Low and Idaho. On it, Hayden beckons his beloved to ""close your eyes and think about/ What you can't live without."" The invitation is as appropriate to the listener as to his lover. It is what it says-- a lullaby-- fading peacefully into sleep. Although its best moments don't reach quite the altitudes of his prior releases, Skyscraper National Park, as a whole, is the most complete and coherent album in Hayden's catalog, a delightful listen from track one through track eleven. The union of his established songwriting talent with his poignant maturity and restraint make Skyscraper National Park convincing, powerful, and well worth purchasing.","In terms of population, Canada (31 million) has New York (8 million) beat by a long shot.

String Quartet II,Morton FeldmanIves Ensemble,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd73abf31b7dc7155f57/1:1/w_160/ad9f289d.gif,2002-01-17 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3026-string-quartet-ii/,hat[now]ART,"In his later years, American composer Morton Feldman wrote long compositions. Really, really long compositions. Piano and String Quartet and For Bunita Marcus each fill an eighty minute CD; For Christian Wolff runs around three hours; For Philip Guston clocks in at over four. Each piece is monolithic, with no interruptions and no movements or other divisions. The mother of them all, however, is his until-now unrecorded String Quartet II. Hat Hut's hat[now]ART imprint just released the first recording, performed by members of the Ives Ensemble for a duration of almost five hours. First performed by the Kronos Quartet, the piece runs anywhere between four and (allegedly) six hours, with few rests and no interruptions. Kronos performed it live several times and never recorded it: they cancelled their scheduled final performance for health reasons. David Harrington, violinist and Kronos' artistic director, said in an interview for the NEA: ""The Second Quartet is physically so demanding... I think marathon runners must go through the same thing we do when we play The Second Quartet... you go in and out of feeling your body is going to break. Even right now when I'm thinking of The Second Quartet I have a shooting pain in my back."" Feldman fans have been waiting for a recording of String Quartet II since Feldman wrote it eighteen years ago. Even if the Ives Ensemble blew it, this record would be a milestone. As it happens, this is a terrific performance of a fascinating work that rewards all the time you can give it. Anyone who hasn't heard a Feldman piece may wonder how the time passes. The short answer is that it doesn't. One of Feldman's agendas was to turn time into space: to make time feel not like a line, but like a landscape that the listener has dropped into. The pieces hardly begin and don't seem to end. He uses only a few themes, but as he repeats a phrase or motif, he alters it by changing the time signature or the dynamics in subtle but discernable ways. Rather than repetitive, the simplest elements become engrossing. With that construction, the size of the works gives them mass. During For Philip Guston, a phrase may slowly repeat until it's heavy and unmovable, like a boulder settling on the floor of the ocean. This superficially sounds like a ""deep listening"" exercise, but unlike ambient music, there's no slack: Feldman's excruciating detail and strict control make the works mentally engaging, refusing to allow a passive audience. It doesn't become the background; it becomes the air you're breathing. Though it's his longest, String Quartet II is one of Feldman's most dynamic and aggressive works. The strings jump between themes, play occasional flurries of notes, and produce a more grinding and aggressive sound than on, say, the serene and austere Piano and String Quartet. In the first 2\xBD hours the music ranges from barely audible to enraged. A set of themes is reworked and revisited; they're so short that they seem more like gestures, until you've heard them so many times that they become melodies. Progress is only experienced measure by measure before the piece changes direction again. By the third disc it calms down: sections last longer and sound more subdued, and some of them are outright pretty. Feldman even throws in a brief pizzicato cello part that's almost funky. The last disc doesn't offer a sharp ending. There's a slow trailing off that again suggests it's not done; we're just leaving it behind. Having never heard the piece in concert, I can't compare this debut recording to any other performance. The Ives Ensemble's playing is just short of academic, but appropriate for this piece. Feldman specifies many tonal colors that the musicians go to pains to reproduce accurately and engagingly. And they don't show the fatigue you might expect at the end-- they've performed this in concert a few times, and may be ""in shape,"" but I'm also not sure how (or in how many pieces) they recorded it. Hat[now]ART published String Quartet II in an edition of only 3,000 copies, which is like locking people out of museums (but which might meet demand). That's unfortunate: Feldman is essential listening. New listeners might start with shorter works, like Kronos' Piano and String Quartet or the New Albion edition of Rothko Chapel, but everyone should have a chance to confront this thing at least once.","In his later years, American composer Morton Feldman wrote long compositions.\n\ Really, really long compositions.

The Bluff,Sarah Dougher,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba009d034d5c69bf5360/1:1/w_160/2e19c181.jpg,2002-01-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2428-the-bluff/,Mr. Lady,"I have a hunch that Sarah Dougher would intimidate me. Not in a starstuck sort of way; like when you find yourself catching a peripheral glance of an icon at the center seat of an entourage table in the sort of place that probably shouldn't have even admitted you, and while you mull over possible comments or questions, you totter on your poor choice of last season's footwear and spill your beer all over the table's most belligerent member. Not that this has happened to me. The intimidation factor on Sarah Dougher arises out of a sense that, from what I've read, she's a woman who has her shit together: she's a professor of writing and classical mythology (among other things), the author of books on racism and railroad building, an ex-member of bands like the Lookers, the Crabs and Cadallaca, and a solo artist with, as of right now, a third solo album under her belt. Her latest, The Bluff caused me to throw open my car doors, sit on the hood, and enjoy the freezing cold of the Blue Ridge Parkway, soundtracked by title song on repeat. To describe this as an album consisting primarily of subtle, pretty songs about relationships (though, technically, it is) risks pigeonholing it as another candidate in an increasingly forgettable list of female singer/songwriters. A conspicuous thread of 60s psychedelic rock runs through the up-tempo tracks on the first part of the album. The best of these, ""Must Believe,"" features Dougher's swirling organ work, and a Nuggets-era minor key guitar line. The lyrics are simple enough, but when Dougher sings, ""When you hold me in your arms, I must believe it's true,"" the manifest sense of desperation (helped by Corin Tucker's banshee backing vocals) elevates the overall sense to something more than retro-pop. Likewise, ""Keep Me"" features a borderline surf-rock guitar line, and deceivingly straightforward lyrics in the verses, while walking the fine line between rage and regret in the choruses: ""You ask me in and then treat me like an uninvited whore/ Don't throw it away/ Nothing beautiful stays."" The second half of the album flirts with a wider variety of influences, and within these, Dougher has some really spectacular moments-- the spare drum machine bossa nova of ""System Works"" resolves itself into a wailing, crunchy chorus. It's a juxtaposition that works, and one of the most unusual songs on the album. Others are less successful. The politely folky ""My Kingdom"" is pretty but predictable, and you'll swear you've heard the spare, major key blues on ""Fall Down"" before. The meditative organ ballad, ""The Choice,"" has a nice resonance to it, but feels druggy and plodding after the album's first half. Say what you like about complaints concerning the track sequence, but it seems to me, the excellent, affecting cover of Allen Toussaint's 1962 piano blues, ""It's Raining,"" would have been a better candidate for album closer. This is an easy album to digest, cleaner, more cautious, and less raw than Dougher's previous, The Walls Ablaze. The edge primarily exists in the contrast between Dougher's earthy, plaintive vocal quality and the tidy lines in the songs. Greater pains have been taken to blur the rawness around the edges. I've always suspected Sarah Dougher is the kind of performer who's constantly engaged in an internal dialogue with her own impulses, as if her more explosive inclinations are tempered by a kind of cautious restraint-- both instrumentally and vocally. She never surrenders herself wholly to a particular persona-- neither spunky, petulant rocker, nor melancholic storyteller. And some of the best moments occur when these internal arguments reveal themselves within the body of songs. Like midway through the elegant, enigmatic title track, when, hanging over a precipice of building guitars, Dougher suddenly pulls back and resolves into sweet and cautious. It works. The bluff. Yeah, I get it.","I have a hunch that Sarah Dougher would intimidate me. Not in a starstuck sort of way; like when you ...

"Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea",Future Pilot AKA,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be66eb335119a49ed066/1:1/w_160/a113468e.gif,2002-01-17 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3254-tiny-waves-mighty-sea/,Domino,"Future Pilot AKA is Sushil K. Dade, the former bassist for the early 90s alternative rock band the Soup Dragons, so it isn't surprising in the least that he would want to distance himself from his past. Remarkably, he's done a pretty good job of it with this project. 1999's A Galaxy of Sound featured an inspired crew of collaborators, including the Pastels, the Red Krayola, Bill Wells, and Kim Fowley, among others. But the new record, Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea, is less of an intercontinental flight than Future Pilot's maiden voyage. Tiny Waves shares its predecessor's collaborate-or-die inclination, but this time, Dade invites musicians closer to his Scottish home. This means I miss a second chance to hear him mixing it up with Suicide's Alan Vega and Andy Weatherall of Two Lone Swordsmen. And I really miss not hearing another Dade composition featuring ex-Fall girl Brix Smith. In these artists' stead, Dade has corralled members of Belle and Sebastian, the Pastels (again), Superstar, the Delgados, Teenage Fanclub, and, erm, James. For three days, Dade frolicked around with the Scottish indie elite, resulting in a soothing pastoral album that more than whiffs of positive love vibes and patchouli. George Harrison would have loved it. Like A Galaxy of Sound, Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea doesn't conceal Dade's Indian heritage. But unlike members of the Anglo-Asian underground, Dade doesn't drop in clanging signifiers such as sputtering tabla runs, sitar jams, or acrobatic vocal melismatics. In fact, Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch sings the album's most overtly Indian song, ""Om Namah Shivaya."" Dade thereby neatly sidesteps stereotype and at the same time fully expresses the nationless, raceless universality of the mantra that literally means, ""I bow to Shiva,"" Shiva being the supreme reality of your inner self. Perhaps some purists will criticize Dade for relocating Indian devotional music in such an unorthodox setting, but to me, Dade's musical accompaniment to this ten-minute swelling and receding acoustic waltz reinforces his insistence of the universality of the chant. Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea doesn't open with such grand intentions. ""Maid of the Loch"" is a dreamy, slightly familiar instrumental that introduces the tranquil musical themes Dade expands upon over the album's thirteen tracks. Amidst glockenspiel chimes and background vocals from the Pastels' Katrina Mitchell, Isobel Campbell lends her indie-baby whisper to the almost nursery rhyme-like traditional hymn ""Ananda Is the Ocean."" Superstar's Joe McAlinden and Jim McColloch harmonize with each other during the roiling cover of Jim Pepper's Native American-influenced jazz-pop crossover hit ""Witchi Tai To."" And after another traditional ballad, ""Darshan,"" Julia Smith sings ""Beautiful Dreamer."" 96-year-old Julia Smith met Dade while he was working for Alzheimer's Scotland. Written by nineteenth-century balladeer Stephen Foster, ""Beautiful Dreamer"" is less known than Foster's most famous songs, ""Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair,"" ""Swanee River,"" and ""Camptown Races."" Smith's performance is, of course, fragile. But as she sings, you can hear the rush of a youthful past fondly remembered. It's as moving a performance as ""Voices of Old People,"" the dialog-collage Simon and Garfunkel included on Bookends. For the devotional ""Shree Ram, Jai Ram,"" Dade wraps the chanted vocals of his wife, Vinita, in glockenspiel tinkles, ground bass notes, and Ralph MacDonald's jittering saxophone. Stephen Pastel contributes a tremolo guitar and electronic treatments to the lullaby ""Opel Waters."" Norman Blake steps up to the vocal mike for ""Beat of a Drum,"" which is, predictably, the most poppy and upbeat track here. Lyrically, ""Beat of a Drum"" is nothing spectacular, a message song about the healing properties of music. Dade needn't resort to the hamfisted language of pop psychology to make his point. The other tracks on this album far more powerfully convey Dade's message than the lyrics Blake gamely and obligingly sings. After Stuart Murdoch's meditative highlight, Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea returns to Earth with MacDonald's tenor sax crying a Coltrane blues amid multiple reverbed guitars and Bill Wells' Wurlitizer. Once the feedback screeches have faded, the album closes, in appropriate blissfulness, with Vinita Dade's unaccompanied ""Prayer for Ananda."" Just as A Galaxy of Sound showcased Dade's experimental side, Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea bountifully displays Dade's tenderness and spirituality. A fusion of these two sides of Dade's artistry would make for an album greater than the sum of its parts, and far hipper than the cred of Dade's collaborators. For now, Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea will tide me over well enough.","Future Pilot AKA is Sushil K. Dade, the former bassist for the early 90s alternative rock band the Soup Dragons ...

Elm Street,Lanterna,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca85e6ef95969322ebd/1:1/w_160/f5873c64.jpg,2002-01-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4688-elm-street/,Badman,"To poorly paraphrase John Cage from his book Silence, if you pay close enough attention, anything can become interesting, and a source of inspiration. It's only when we try to ignore something-- say, a sound-- that it becomes annoying or boring. I'm not sure of the universality of that statement, but such is the case with Champaign, Illinois' Laterna on its long-delayed sophomore album, Elm Street. All instrumental, and performed exclusively on guitar, ARP synth, and drum kit, Elm Street features 12 ambient, minimalist treks through inner and outer space. If you allow them, the songs will just kind of hang there like an old landscape painting in your grandmother's parlor that no one ever looks at. But if you're in the right frame of mind (maybe after a couple cups of coffee), the record immerses you in a idyllic, windswept world of sound. It's the kind of music that might accompany a film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine: safe and sentimental, while simultaneously implying a darker, harsher world. The album begins with the title track, which starts with a finely picked acoustic guitar pattern, slowly fading cymbal crashes (if you can even call them crashes) and distant droning. It's got a pastoral, quaint, and jovial quality that makes it sound like segue music from ""Northern Exposure."" ""B-Minor"" is next, introducing an electrified, U2-sounding guitar jangle to the mix that sticks around for nearly the entire album, its echo and reverb set on maximum. The next set of songs-- ""Spirits,"" ""Thirty,"" and ""Departure""-- indistinguishably meld into one elongated cycle, undercutting the playful, jovial vibe of the first two tracks with an increasingly eerie and spooky build-up, and making greater use of the ARP. By the time the creepy, sci-fi-sounding ""Old Seattle"" comes around, the guitar has virtually been abandoned. But then it's quickly back to Earth with ""Wolves,"" which as might be guessed, uses some cheesy FX to mimic a certain lupine howl. ""Smoke,"" with its galloping rhythm, is the sound trying to get home before nightfall, while ""Saturn's Rings,"" despite its otherworldly title, sounds more like that nightfall slowly settling in, like it does on long summer days. ""New Moon"" returns to the acoustic ambience of the lead-off track minus the drums, while ""Glass"" is the exact opposite: as the closest thing to a ""rocker"" you're gonna get with this album, the song's drums come out of hibernation and there's even a touch of distortion on the guitar. ""Dog Days"" rounds out the album with a 12-minute patience-tester that fades out with the late-summer drones of cicada and cricket chirps-- a nice touch to cap off the album, but a bit long to wait for it. Upon first listen, I mistook Lanterna's brand of slow-paced sonic sculpture for new age music, and they do lean in that direction from time to time, veering dangerously close to ""Songs of the Whale"" territory. But after a few times through, I saw something closer to Fripp/Eno or even instrumental Felt, though not nearly as layered as the former and not as chiming and riff-oriented as the latter. And though the band is still a long way from such minimalist masters as Glass, Reich, or Riley, they still successfully manage to do a whole lot within the very narrow confines they've set for themselves.","To poorly paraphrase John Cage from his book Silence, if you pay close enough attention, anything can become interesting, and ...

Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow,Jonathan Richman,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2719d034d5c69bf2bd0/1:1/w_160/b372c2ab.jpg,2002-01-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6781-her-mystery-not-of-high-heels-and-eye-shadow/,Vapor,"Iconoclasts suffer. It's the fate of simply being yourself. Such is the story of Jonathan Richman. Jonathan's the type of guy who'd have serenaded the head cheerleader at two a.m. in a mariachi outfit, and done it straight-faced with complete sincerity. She'd have been creeped out, and Jonathan would've inevitably been beaten bloody by her boyfriend, but once he wised up and turned his attention to the girls that are truly feverish for romance-- those geeky girls with Harlequins tucked under their mattresses-- they'd swoon to his unabashedly heartfelt and naïve yearning. Of course, such romanticism is cloying when taken seriously, but Richman always conveys-- however subtly-- that his tongue's in-cheek. Richman's not a newcomer to the music scene by any stretch of the imagination. Including the couple of albums he cut with the seminal proto-punk band the Modern Lovers, Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow represents his 19th full-length release. Despite recording one of the most prescient albums in rock history and his prolific catalog, Richman is still a pretty obscure artist with a small following. But even if you've never heard the name Jonathan Richman, chances are you're more familiar with him than you think, largely due to his cameos in There's Something About Mary. Yes, that was him. And his little segues actually manage to give a pretty good general impression of Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow. The seeds of Richman's current sound were all sewn in the winsome 1950s: sparse rockabilly and doo-wop arrangements filled with conventional romantic truisms, but also sharpened with an understated wit; there are even some awkward ventures into Latin forms like the bolero, meringue and the samba, as stiff and amusing as a gringo learning to salsa. It's all lightweight stuff, but that's where its charm lies. Her Mystery is full of the mawkish sentimentality of young love, naïve sexuality and the stirrings of spring: ""On Canal Street in April when it's 60 and the snow is melting fast/ It's still shady in the morning when you're laughing in your t-shirt running past/ In Tompkins Square Park a couple is meeting/ Say what you want, but I feel my heart beating/ Because I love springtime in New York, springtime in New York, I do."" ""From Springtime in New York"" sums up the wide-eyed, Gump-like unaffectedness of the songs here; the album contains about as many illicit thoughts as a eunuch in a harem. Later, on the same track, he sings: ""On 1st Avenue, a couple is breakin' up/ Eviction, too, they must be shaken up/ But I love springtime in New York."" It's lines like these that give the album its clever, off-kilter orientation. Nothing seems to bring this guy down; I don't think there's an ounce of cortisol in his system. Even conflict is viewed as naturally as a morning shit in songs like ""Couples Must Fight"": ""My heart knows pain, my heart knows sorrow/ My heart knows wrongs that could never make right/ But for a better day tomorrow, couples must argue, couples must fight."" A five year old couldn't state it more simply. I don't know how well Richman knows his Spanish, but the last four songs are sung exclusively en Español, as eagerly as a student looking for extra credit. He reminded me of David Byrne toying with these Latin rhythms-- the voices are even quite similar, and there seems to be a strain of Trio Los Panchos influence winding its way through the album with the intricate guitar picking that opens some of the tracks. For the most part, the songs are stripped to the bare minimum: acoustic guitar, bass and a minimal drum kit, often played with a brush. There's an appearance from what sounds like a bass clarinet on ""I Took a Chance"" and the title track, and there's some additional percussion to spice things up on the Latin numbers, but that's it. The album as a whole encompasses enough styles to sound almost like a cover album. Many of the tracks sound vaguely familiar, with Richman providing new lyrics. The rhythmic progression of ""Springtime in New York"" is just like Prince's ""The Beautiful Ones""; ""Tonight"" is ""Earth Angel""; and others were agonizingly hard to place, but I think mostly, the familiarity is just the result of the deceptive simplicity of these songs. Albums this unpretentious are increasingly rare, and I think that's what makes Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow so seductive. We all used to view the world this way before we hit puberty, got a job, got dumped a few times and became so suspicious of others' motives. It's nice to know we have albums like this to turn on instead of CNN when we want things to be just a little less complicated.","Iconoclasts suffer. It's the fate of simply being yourself.

The Convenience of Indecision,Sorry About Dresden,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d0c0084474cd0c0594/1:1/w_160/d140d078.gif,2002-01-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7360-the-convenience-of-indecision/,Saddle Creek,"So I've rolled up my shirt sleeves and sat my ass in front of the computer screen. I've primed my fingers to write something cute or creative. Nothing has come. Sorry About Dresden has me stumped. Their music is so uninspiring, it's jolted me into writer's block. Let's just get this over with. Sorry About Dresden (SAD) is a five-piece ensemble from North Carolina that specializes in guitar-heavy indie rock. The music definitely has more mainstream appeal than your average hipster geeks. The focus is on the songwriting, a blend of pop melodies and growling relationship angst. Songs frequently end with choruses repeated as a mantra, with vocalist Matt Oberst (yes, of the notorious Oberst clan) progressively gaining more passion. When Oberst wants you to feel his pain, it's a little too obvious-- usually delivered high and hard, at the top of his range. If I had to peg his voice, I'd say it's a cross of Dave Pirner and Elvis Costello, replete with faux British accent. I've said this numerous times before, but I will repeat it here: there is, unequivocally, no point to this record. Be proud of your home Tarheel State, Matt. If I were in the mood for conspiracy theories, I'd also complain about the sequencing of the tracks. Just for kicks, picture The Convenience of Indecision as a mathematical function. If the album could be graphed, it would start fairly high, at around the 7 or 8 range (the opening track, ""A Losing Season"") and regress downwards with a slope of negative one, until it reaches ""0"" with the unimaginative throwaway closer, ""A Reunion of Sorts."" To put it another way, it's a top heavy album; everything worth listening to is in the first four tracks. It seems like a ruse to con music store listeners into purchasing an LP with the substance of an EP. Maybe they should title the disc, The Convenience of Capitalizing on In-Store Listening-Kiosk Impatience. Or not. But honesty would be nice. Cutting to the chase, The Convenience of Indecision is nondescript, semi-indie rock with little to grab a hold of. Sorry about the writer's block, but Sorry About Dresden will do that to you.","So I've rolled up my shirt sleeves and sat my ass in front of the computer screen. I've ...

Wonderland,The Charlatans UK,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a587c0084474cd0c0745/1:1/w_160/e99a8817.jpg,2002-01-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1401-wonderland/,MCA,"So it's been a long time since the whole Madchester thing. Back then, pretty much everyone had written off the Charlatans as also-rans-- their early offerings just didn't match up to the mighty Stone Roses or Happy Mondays. Thankfully for us, the Charlatans were undaunted by their own press, and by now they've outlived every other band of that all-but-forgotten early 90s movement. And anyone checking out the UK charts could tell you that they've definitely had the last laugh, despite the tragedies and calamities that have delayed them on their way into the vanguard of prominent UK rock acts. It seems somewhat fitting that the band's seventh album, coming just over ten years after their debut, should find them re-exploring some of the dance-rock fusion that carried their first efforts. Their last album, 1999's Us & Us Only, found them more squarely in trad-rock territory than ever before, bathing in ominous analog synths and searching for answers. The change probably stemmed a great deal from the fact that it was the band's first album written in the wake of original keyboardist Rob Collins' death in a car accident. Wonderland takes the sound of that last album and pumps it full of the energy that dripped from the band's previous releases, resulting in a record that can oddly be both fragile, danceable, and anthemic all at the same time. Let's put it this way: if this album had been released in 1992, it would almost certainly have been held up as a future classic. A decade later, it simply sounds damn good. Perhaps the biggest difference in the band's sound on Wonderland is in Tim Burgess' voice. He adopts a previously unknown falsetto on several of the songs here, and though it's not as strong as his usual singing voice, it works surprisingly well in most places. Case in point is the first single, ""Love Is the Key,"" a catchy R&B-influenced; tune replete with female backing singers. Drummer John Brookes and bassist Martin Blunt drive the song hard, but it's Tony Rogers' funky organ comping and Rhodes lines that really elevate it. Rogers has done remarkably well for himself trying to fill Rob Collins' sizable shoes since joining the band, and here he continues to assert himself as the Charlatans' guiding musical force. Nearly as obvious a choice for a single is ""I Just Can't Get Over Losing You,"" which creeps in slowly before kicking into another one of the band's infectious grooves. Burgess exhorts you to get down, and it's pretty likely that you won't have any problem complying. Guitarist Mark Collins weaves dozens of little stuttering passages through the mix, vying with Rogers for control of the harmonic and countermelodic space. This is followed by the instrumental ""The Bell and the Butterfly,"" a four-minute bass- and drum-dominated rave-up that opens with a bombastic, fuzzed-out bass riff, then completely recontextualizes the riff with programmed, almost junglist beats. Brookes joins the programmed percussion on his kit as Blunt briefly reprises the bassline from ""Love Is the Key"" before launching off on an impressive lead tangent. Tracks like ""The Bell and the Butterfly"" are one of the reasons I love the Charlatans as much as I do. In an era when it's cool for rock bands to be ashamed of being rock bands, the Charlatans aren't. No matter how much programming they incorporate or how many other elements color their sound, they're a rock band at heart, unafraid to rock out just for the sake of it. And there's plenty of subtle programming to be found on Wonderland-- little artificial hi-hat flourishes color the edges of the beat in ""And If I Fall,"" which just might contain one of the best choruses the band has ever written. Elsewhere, ""A Man Needs to Be Told"" most closely resembles Us & Us Only's rootsy vibe, employing none other than Daniel Lanois on the pedal steel. It's amazing how well the faux-country sound suits the band. Burgess' falsetto feels more at home surrounded by the keening guitars and extra percussion (provided by Jim Keltner, who's played with absolutely everybody, including Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, Ry Cooder, George Harrison, and John Lennon). ""Wake Up"" runs in a slightly similar vein, breaking into a melodic ballad after a guitar intro that you could pretty easily mistake for a mid-80s King Crimson track. Soon afterward, though, the guitar is dripping in Leslie and wah pedals. Burgess presides over the song with some uncharacteristically aggressive lyrics, including the catchy couplet, ""Sayin' something, saying nothing/ You'll be a little quieter with a gun in your mouth."" This is followed by the mellotron- and piano-drenched ""Is It in You?,"" which, for all its gripping atmosphere, is one of the few songs on the album that doesn't really hang onto your ear after grabbing it. The closing ""Ballad of the Band"" doesn't really do much to lift things, either, and the album unfortunately ends on a somewhat lackluster note. Regardless of the ending, though, the Charlatans have managed to release yet another immensely satisfying album. The deft synthesis of all of the band's past incarnations speaks to the fact that their best work may indeed lie ahead of them. If you're looking for a starting place for the Charlatans, I'd probably recommend Tellin' Stories or Us & Us Only first, but Wonderland is a worthy entry from one of Britain's most underappreciated bands.","So it's been a long time since the whole Madchester thing.

Escalo Frio,Otto Von Schirach,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9715e6ef95969321407/1:1/w_160/7c176c56.jpg,2002-01-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8492-escalo-frio/,Schematic,"Otto Von Schirach is, by some margin, the most excitable boy on the Schematic roster. While Richard Devine abandoned the notion of DSP fuckery as an end in itself with the brooding Aleamapper LP and Scott Herren has put his trad-IDM persona Delarosa and Asora on ice in favor of hip-hop stylings of Prefuse 73, Von Schirach continues his assault on stasis unabated with his second album, the frenetic Escalo Frio. My first pass through Escalo Frio was most unpleasant. Roughly half of the 21 tracks here seem to me nothing more than Reaktor demonstration pieces, overflowing with an incredible array of sounds that call attention to themselves without ever working together to say anything interesting, or even coherent. Tracks like ""Sasquash,"" ""Coconut"" and ""Fog"" are almost unbearable to sit through, consisting of an endless stream of self-consciously ""weird"" sounds that never coalesce, never swing, and can provoke no reaction beyond a steadily increasing annoyance. Quite honestly, I cannot understand the appeal of this post-Autechre spastic colonoscopy; it seems meaningless and terminally boring. The only way I can make sense of the worst tracks on Escalo Frio is to place them into some kind cartoon music framework. Carl Stalling was, of course, the genius that wrote music for Warner Brothers' Loony Toons (he's frequently namechecked by John Zorn). Schirach's rapid changes and unfamiliar textures could possibly serve as the soundtrack to a parallel world built from alternate physics, much like the one alluded to by Stalling's genre-surfing and zany deployment of effects. Still, try as I might to imagine how this music might work for somebody else, I still don't believe it could ever work for me. But these are the worst tracks I'm talking about-- the cluttered, aimless displays of programming technique that mar more than half this disc. Fortunately, a few tracks manage to make a better impression after a while. Of particular interest is Schirach's dabbling in cut-up hip-hop, reminiscent of Prefuse 73 without seeming like a rip-off. The criminally brief ""Mr. Egyptian Hologram"" (which features some production assistance from Matmos), for example, is a killer track, containing an MC sample twisted into rhythmic knots, nostalgic toy synths, and a forceful bass punch. Coming from a similar place but without the vocals is ""Fabric,"" which is home to one of the record's few head-nodding rhythms and a production environment that allows the cutting electro rhythm room to breath. Still, in the end, these brief glimpses into Schirach's potential as an auteur of 23rd-century Jeep music only make the rest of the album that much more difficult to bear.","Otto Von Schirach is, by some margin, the most excitable boy on the Schematic roster.

Record in Red,Marmoset,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b469fc7814a47cd6e9/1:1/w_160/cc0935f6.jpg,2002-01-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5111-record-in-red/,Secretly Canadian,"As the Secretly Canadian story goes, Marmoset member Jorma Whittaker is the son of ""Whitey"" Whittaker, the official tour bus driver for the non-secretly Canadian band Rush for about twenty years. Legend has it that Geddy Lee played the rough mix of their album Signals for Jorma before it was released. Maybe thankfully, the Ayn-noying individualist fetish of ""New World Man"" and ""The Analog Kid"" doesn't seem to have rubbed off at all. Like Geddy Lee, though, Jorma Whittaker does happen to be the bassist and lead singer of his band. But don't expect a castrated screech-- we've been spared such torture. Marmoset seems to have blissfully missed the 80s, actually, to be influenced by every other decade. Take ""Golden Cloak,"" one of the band's catchier songs. It sounds similar to the Velvet Underground's ""Ocean,"" an outtake from Loaded: the organ swirls like vintage Cale while Whittaker sings in pure Reed pre-glam fashion, as if filled with wonderment at the things he's discovering in his own song. He describes the features of the cloak (which ""makes you high""), and then he pulls the indie-rawk kiss-off-- they're features, you see, that he's ""so fucking sick of."" The song builds up all this psych-rock mystique just to end almost indifferently half a minute later. Record in Red cycles through a grab-bag of styles. The opener, ""Eyes Are Looking,"" is pure Beat Happening pop with its fey ""da da da"" male/female harmonies and jangly, lo-fi guitar. Then, two tracks later, ""Winter"" rips into wild guitar theatrics that'll have you asking, ""The Who?"" The driving drums and tight rhythm track on ""The City"" recalls the Doors or the Zombies' ""Don't Cry For Me,"" and its echoing, overdubbed vox might catch you doing the swim, arms waving past your head like it's the 60s all over again. And just when you expect the entire album to be a pastiche of trendy genres, ""December 4th"" drops the drums and the pretense for an acoustic number that's equal parts Elliott Smith and Kurt Cobain. In this case, it isn't an insult that you can easily come up with comparisons for the band; if anything, Marmoset make a virtue out of neurotic decade-hopping. Their erratic talent might seem a bit unfocused at times, since song-length averages about two minutes, but Whittaker ties it all together with his charm. His self-obsessed and sexxee vocal swoons turn each track into an anthem, even on little vignettes like ""Artmaker"" when he adopts a mock-Germanic accent, repeating the phrase, ""Artmaker, strangulator,"" into absurdity. The album gives off a slightly dark, druggy vibe, especially when the handclaps and piano jabs of ""Summertime Is Easy"" sink under the morbid, endless repetition of Whittaker's chorus. But rather than drown in affectations, overall, Record in Red's coy fascination with itself reminds me of why pop music is so much fun.","As the Secretly Canadian story goes, Marmoset member Jorma Whittaker is the son of ""Whitey"" Whittaker, the official tour bus ...

Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones but Words Will Never Hurt Me,No-Neck Blues Band,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c412ea9e61561daa807c/1:1/w_160/e96e0334.gif,2002-01-15 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5816-sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones-but-words-will-never-hurt-me/,Revenant,"There was a time hundreds of years ago where, in many parts of the world, there was no such thing as a musician. That's not to say there was no music, of course. Among small tribes of people in Africa or the early Americas, there was no such thing as a musician because there was no such thing as a non-musician. Music was a daily part of everyone's life, and without modern conveniences like turntables and CD players, that music had to be made anew every day. Now, when it came time to doing this, were there those that stepped up, stood out, took the lead? Probably. But it's also a pretty safe bet that there was no such thing as an audience. The making of music was for everybody, as important a part of their lives as the food they ate or the air they breathed. Today, music has become very sectionalized. There's a discernable line between musicians and non-musicians, between those who know and those who do not. But there are those who still scoff at such segregation, those who recognize that music is in the hearts of us all-- it merely needs to be conjured up. For every buzzkill who believes music to be a solely academic exercise, there are those who believe otherwise, those who recognize that when it comes to making music, there's something more important than training, discipline or hard work: passion. There are, to this day, people who believe, as did the far wiser souls who graced these grounds before us, that music is a crucial, healing force that all can and must play a part in. For these people, there is the No-Neck Blues Band, an ironically named New York based octet making music rooted in the tradition of people for whom music was not some mere frivolity, but a way of life. The music on Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones but Words Will Never Hurt Me has a very primal feel about it. These are songs built out of the chants, moans and screams of its makers every bit as much as pianos, guitars, basses, harmonicas, flutes, horns and drums. The songs here often start slow, with one, two or three members of the group picking up a simple musical idea and running with it. Very patiently, they'll elaborate on their chosen theme, while the rest of the octet flounders about it, searching for different ways to interact, waiting for the right point of entry. This is a fascinating process, one which allows the listener to observe while these songs are repeatedly built, taken apart and put back together. ""Assignment Subud,"" for example, one of the few tracks on the album given a name, begins with a prolonged period of improvised noise. Percussion is played haphazardly, bereft of any rhythm. Woodwinds and strings enter and exit, each taking their own paths and unconcerned with the other instruments. Guitars are strummed at random. A spastic saxophone interjects wildly. A few minutes in, a distant female voice appears in the mix as the percussion tightens slightly, like buzzards coming together from disparate parts of the sky, starting to circle, preparing to swoop down upon a carcass. A bass is bowed, a male voice joins in. The two singers interact, not concerning themselves with words, using their voices instead as instruments. By the six-minute mark, the pieces begin to come together; the guitar parts begin to resemble a melody, the vocals take a non-static pattern and the percussion section tightens, now keeping a very discernable, very driven beat around which the other instruments sculpt their improvisations. From here on in, the song propels itself, building towards a dramatic climax where the saxophone returns, squealing madly as the male vocalist cries out in passion. He speaks no words, and yet the listener understands. Other songs, like ""The Natural Bridge,"" the album's opener, move along at a more peaceful pace, lingering on a beat and flirting with the idea of structure, like a hybrid between an Native American chant and the Art Ensemble of Chicago's most out-there moments. Elsewhere, on the album's untitled closer, the group nearly finds song structure, employing Beefheartian tendencies (both in the instrumentation and the vocals) to their style, actual lyrics, and a surprisingly funky bass part to the group's lazy groove. It almost seems strange after the freedom that precedes it, but ultimately, it makes sense. No-Neck is a band constantly experimenting and constantly playing, in the most innocent, childlike sense of the word. It only makes sense, then, that eventually they'd stumble upon something that resembles a traditional song. And by closing the album on this note, No-Neck and veteran producer Jerry Jester (Tom Waits, the Lovin' Spoonful) quiet those jaded naysayers out there who will attempt to dismiss the inspired, free-spirited nature of the music on Sticks and Stones as amateurish wankery. Still, No-Neck's primal brand of improvisation might be a hard sell for some. A friend of mine scoffed upon first hearing this album. ""I dunno,"" he said. ""It's okay, but it sounds a lot like a bunch of us just jamming in the basement. Maybe I'm just not giving us enough credit, but I don't really get it."" But that's just it-- he wasn't giving us enough credit. When I play music with my friends, we don't do it with any intentions of fame, money or recognition. We do it because it's fun. We do it because we love to do it. There's a certain quality, something magical to these sorts of haphazard musical excursions where what's missing in proper structure and form is more than made up for in passion and energy. And it's this same quality that makes the No-Neck Blues Band so damned amazing. The more I think about it, the less I consider the No-Neck Blues Band's name to be ironic. In a sense, the music on Sticks and Stones has more to do with the blues than the surface lets on. Maybe not in structure, but in the way it transforms raw emotion into musical gold. By shunning the traditional rules of their form, throwing away all expectations, ignoring all of art's potential to create pressure and just playing, the No-Neck Blues Band has given us an album that's every bit as unique as it is moving. Indeed, it's the very freedom from typical music rules, the very casual atmosphere in which this music was clearly created, that makes it work. This music was not made to sell records or to make the musicians household names (in fact, most of the band prefers to remain anonymous). No, this music was made for the only reason music should ever be made: because it had to be.","There was a time hundreds of years ago where, in many parts of the world, there was no such thing ...

"Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils",The Drag City Supersession,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba099d034d5c69bf5372/1:1/w_160/082e26ce.jpg,2002-01-15 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2439-tramps-traitors-and-little-devils/,Drag City,"Being a talented musician must be pretty cool. While other people spend hours at a time hunched over their respective instruments, trying desperately to come up with a single song that's worth a damn, you can do better things with your time. For instance, you can feed a hungry child. Or you can build a terrarium. Or, if you're so inclined, you can record a terrible album with your talented musician friends. Of course, talent is not without its down side. One of the most common arguments used in the defense of shitty music is, ""Hey, man, these guys may not be the best musicians in the world, but they work totally hard! I've known them for years, and I've never known more hard-working, dedicated people. Fuck you for judging them! They once slept on my couch! I know the bassist's sister!"" In other words: ""They have no talent, but they try really hard."" But when a slew of crazily talented musicians come together and turn out a sloppy and tossed-off mess, things are a little harder to justify. The Drag City Supersession is made up of core musicians Bill Callahan ((Smog)), Rian Murphy, Neil Michael Hagerty, and Edith Frost. All are talented performers and songwriters; all have made significant contributions to the world of independent music; and all have done so in their own distinctively unique ways. Yet with Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils, the focus that has enabled these musicians to create such convincing work is entirely absent. And as they struggle through weak-as-fuck Sabbath covers and barely rehearsed originals, it leaves this record sounding less like a Supersession than a high school talent show. Sloppiness is okay when it's a by-product of uncontainable energy. But on Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils, with its awkward, fumbling guitar parts and poorly arranged strings, one can't help but feel that this was a project thrown together quickly by people who really didn't give a fuck about it. There's no energy. There's no fun. There's no reason for them to subject people to this. Within the first few seconds of the Bill Callahan original, ""Zero Degrees,"" that opens the record, it's clear that Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils isn't going to be an easy ride. The song itself is not nearly up to par with most of Callahan's material, relying mostly upon a vaguely dissonant and tremendously uninteresting bass riff. But as the song develops, it becomes clear why Callahan wouldn't have wanted one of his better songs to appear on this record-- it's hard to imagine somebody saying, ""Why don't I use one of my best songs for this new, thrown-together 'Supersession' so that Neil Michael Hagerty can skullfuck it with an out-of-tune slide guitar?"" There's nothing wrong with being a little out of tune when the music calls for it, but the combination of sloppy, tuneless guitar, and pointless, unmelodic bass makes ""Zero Degrees"" nothing short of painful listening. If the musicians involved in this record actually listened back to this kind of thing and said, ""Man, I can't wait for my name to be attached to this,"" they should at the very least retire, and at the very most be force-fed their own ears. Perhaps I'm being a little too hard on these people. Their collective musical talents have given me hours upon hours of enjoyment, and musical memories that will last me for the rest of my life. But all that just doesn't change the fact that Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils blows. At its best, like on Edith Frost's ""Leaving the Army,"" it's sufficiently unobtrusive, with unnecessary guitar plunking only minimally fucking up an otherwise passable song. Hey, on ""Old Man,"" when Frost is basically left to her own for a little while, it's downright pretty. But as a ""Supersession,"" with no one musician's vision guiding the way, Drag City's impressive roster is reduced to a tuneless jam band whose members don't even sound like they're having a good time. Drag City, indeed.","Being a talented musician must be pretty cool. While other people spend hours at a time hunched over their respective ...

Overnight,Chessie,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5adc0084474cd0c079b/1:1/w_160/a91323be.jpg,2002-01-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1435-overnight/,Plug Research,"Named after the corporate identity of the former Chesapeake & Ohio, Baltimore & Ohio and Western Maryland Railroads, Chessie are back with their third album of locomotive ambience and post-rock caboosery. Far from being a fish-paste sandwich-munching trainspotter saddo, Stephen Gardner, Chessie's founding member, makes railways sound kinda brainy. Gardner, originally the bassist for D.C.'s Lorelei, started this project as an outlet for his explorations into sound collage, tape loop rhythms, guitar noise, and the similarity-- as he puts it-- between organic and constructed sounds and the ""way that railroads bisect the natural world with machinery."" Chessie's debut, Signal Series, won Amazon.com's best Dance and DJ album for 1998. In Gardner's words, the album sought ""to set up patterns of conflicting and interacting machinery in natural settings."" Thus, he allowed pummeling old school hardcore breakbeats to rampage through drifts of scorching ambience. Bolstered by the permanent addition of studio engineer Ben Bailes, Chessie toned the beats down for the far-more Tortoise-y Meet, an album for which the band never won a single gong. After the release of Meet Andy Ingalls, a guest on Meet's ""Brake Test"" became a full-time contributor to the group. Though the band's latest release, Overnight, reprises the style of Meet rather than Signal Series, Overnight is, for me, a more confident, concentrated album. Chessie sound secure in leaving dead air. This is nowhere better demonstrated than during ""K-Tower."" An anxious but investigative bassline searches through spines of guitar tweaks, as though Richie Hawtin had remixed Public Image Ltd.'s ""Albatross."" ""Pantograph Up"" takes the opposite tack and pushes white noise and four-to-the-floor beats beyond the red zone in a loving homage to Succour-era Seefeel. ""S to U"" showcases the band's dexterity with a six-string-- the track sounds like the Cocteau Twins' shimmer blended with the Sundays' pop-nous with Durrutti Column's Vini Reilly on solo detail. ""Lineside"" roils like Main's deep listening firmament. ""Cross Harbor Interchange"" launches off from loops of bursting white noise beneath which almost metronomic rhythmic pulses clatter, as though an immense locomotive juggernaut is passing by the listener. In this regard, ""Cross Harbor Interchange"" is an update of Signal Series' ""Clear Block."" By contrast, Overnight takes a branchline trip into a fuzzed-out, Oval-ized version of Eno's Music for Airports with the sparse ""Northern Maine Junction."" Plug Research have shown sound judgment in adding Chessie to their roster. Though ""Northern Maine Junction"" is the only Overnight track that fits immediately within the label's aesthetic, Plug Research recognizes talent. As with labelmates Soulo, Chessie now have the support and the encouragement to make The Great Leap. After Signal Series and Meet, Overnight contains few surprises; it's a logical progression from the group's previous releases, and I have no quibble with its high quality. But where's the whiff of danger, the thrill of the unknown? It's understandable that a band so influenced by railroads should wish to avoid derailment at all costs, but sometimes riding hobo-style on Risk's runaway loco is what it takes to get you crashing into the festooned buffers of Glory Central Station.","Named after the corporate identity of the former Chesapeake & Ohio, Baltimore & Ohio and Western Maryland Railroads, Chessie are back with ...

The Uncertainty of the Monkey,Posthuman,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10b13d1975652138527/1:1/w_160/7a32497d.gif,2002-01-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6439-the-uncertainty-of-the-monkey/,Seed,"You'll just have to imagine the typical introduction, illustrating evolution as a shaping factor in our lives, addressing its musical manifestation as suggested by this group's Darwinian name and album title. The outline would take shape through the idea of natural selection, with different genres like glitch and jungle occupying developmental niches in the survival of the fittest, and the eventual epochal shift when one lifeform incorporates all those traits. Let's cut to the chase: Posthuman have recorded an awesome album, one of the best IDM-oriented releases of 2001. All the more impressive that The Uncertainty of the Monkey is their debut, and the first record for their label Seed. Little is known about the duo, but the music speaks for itself. ""Jacson of Israel_Beautiful Beast"" begins unsettlingly with demonic Blair-Witch-warbling while minimal synth winds stir the air and disturbingly artificial snares create tension by panning between the channels, regular and yet erratic. Then the hunt begins, a disorienting rush of metallic crashes and whooming bass that descends into increasingly complex Confields. Posthuman display more sonic range than Autechre, though, evidenced as the frantic animal cooings are caught up in an austere keyboard melody. A second, more subdued section of the song begins, and the elements slowly subtract themselves from the mix until the 10-minute opener concludes in orchestral ambience. ""15 Seconds to Get to Spain_Hogan"" changes it up with mechanic hip-hop beats, funky as fuck, met by a searing synth stab harder than anything El-P cooked up on the Can Ox album last year. Posthuman have an uncanny knack for hiding mini-melodies amongst all the wobbly bass, and you can hear them on this track as a keyboard accent that lurked in the background gets looped over and over until it all ends in cycling claustrophobia. They play with a very raw sound palette, and so the digital sounds are far abstracted from any instrumental referents. Parts of their music imitate the jittering flow of Download, but without the emphasis on smacked-up house rhythms. When the instruments do reveal their origins, as on ""Quetzacotl_Grathard Debacle,"" it comes startlingly as a harsh acoustic guitar strum appears over the clicking mandible chatter and floating keyboards. So this isn't just a mélange of sounds thrown out at once-- each song has a highly narrative structure, like hunting for signs of organic life in Future Sound of London's Dead Cities. A hint of the human touch appears with the live version of this song on the last track. You can hear a generic trance groove faintly in the background, along with the duo fumbling at their decks and muttering back and forth. Then the actual song kicks in, another beat-driven symphony of squelch. Thanks be to Posthuman, also, for putting the ""dance"" back in Intelligent Dance Music. ""Plethora_Fagans Never Never"" brings the funk with a litany of minimalist-techno breaks. Meanwhile, ""Wednesday"" stalks about the underbrush of booming bass and insectile glitch chirps, then catches the scent of a presumably Aphexian species. It pivots and transforms into a stomping electro number, acrid avid jam shredding in discombobulated fury. And ""Wrongfuleyes"" lures with prelude-to-the-afternoon-of-a-fawn calmness before morphing into a near-industrial anthem complete with dramatic keyboard vamps. The Uncertainty of the Monkey is anything but hesitant. Posthuman's songs are overly confident, and their dark, spacious sound rises up from deep bass in the background, a resonant synthesizer midrange and crisp beatscapes in the fore. As a debut, this album sets an aggressive mood, but the cold atmosphere doesn't alienate-- instead, there's the draw of a certain predatorial sexuality. And in the deft combination of narrative structure, dense sonic texture and progressive rhythm, the duo have secured a place for themselves in IDM history. I wish there was more reconnaissance on them-- rumors abound about their affiliation with Skam Records and the bashes they host in London's Aldwych disused underground station. But if you follow the ""secret"" link on their homepage, you'll discover photos of the band and their mates, living it up in various flats and generally looking like they haven't a care in the world. It's a refreshing bit of humanity amongst all the cybernetic atmosphere, and the glimpse of a poster of Orbital's In Sides on a back wall reveals another trace of familial history.","You'll just have to imagine the typical introduction, illustrating evolution as\n\ a shaping factor in our lives, addressing ...

Through Small Windows,Alsace Lorraine,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a064c0084474cd0bfb74/1:1/w_160/3cdd502b.jpg,2002-01-14 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/135-through-small-windows/,Darla,"It's amazing the difference one little hyphen can make. Consider: Alsace-Lorraine is a region in France, lying west of the Rhine on the German border. The oft-disputed region has changed hands dozens of times over the centuries and is home to one of the most colossal military failures of the 20th Century-- the Maginot Line, an imposing series of defenses intended to guard France's frontier from any German advance. Unfortunately for the French military, in 1939 the Germans had no qualms about simply conquering Belgium and going around the Maginot Line, rendering it useless. But take away that hyphen and you have Alsace Lorraine, a trio of Chicagoans who make pleasant, but ultimately bland pop music with a slight European affectation. The band's songs are cut roughly from the same mold as those of Stephin Merritt-- unfortunately for Alsace Lorraine, though, it seems as though Merritt hogged all of the memorable melodies for himself. As a result, the 16 songs on Through Small Windows pass by like a single 40-minute blur of meandering, atmospheric pop. In this instance, atmospheric is not a compliment. Part of the problem may lie in the fact that Caitlin Brice simply doesn't make for a convincing frontwoman-- her voice is too wispy to ever come across as commanding, and the words she sings too often get lost in the echoing background provided by Hewson Chen (also a member of Vitesse) and Paul Francke. The band's formula instantly brings to mind Saint Etienne comparisons, and those comparisons hold up to a point; however, any Saint Etienne album will offer more variety and interest than this one. Through Small Windows opens with ""You Are Like Charles Lindbergh to Me,"" though you'd be hard pressed to differentiate it from much of what follows. Indeed, often the most interesting aspect of the songs are the titles-- for instance, ""Name Etched in Homeroom Chair"" and ""Alex Runs the World"" look promising, but the loosely strummed guitars buried low in the mix and textured, reverb-drenched synths don't really do much to back up Brice as she attempts to convey the lyrics. ""Chalk Marks on the Ground"" manages to distinguish itself better than most of the songs here, offering a more solid vocal hook than usual and a slightly more upbeat programmed drum rhythm, but the band's overarchingly flaccid music doesn't do anything to help drive the writing home. The lyrics look okay on paper, too, with passages like, ""A heart is dead/ Chalk marks are on the ground/ When they rolled away the stone to the tomb/ Nobody was found,"" fleshing out the story of a misfit rather nicely. ""Dreams I Can't Control,"" the band's first recording, with vocalist Ruth Welte, also benefits from a slightly different approach, though it's actually difficult to tell Welte's voice from Brice's without knowing about the difference first. The trembling synths and mid-tempo Moby beat rather unfortunately conjure images of Lexuses travelling across White Sands during prime-time more than they recall the teenage heartbreak Welte sings about. Note to Darla marketing staff: get on the phone to Toyota. Further strengthening the Stephin Merritt comparison is ""Though I've Never Seen You,"" which sounds so much like something from the Magnetic Fields' Holiday that I keep expecting Merritt to start singing, ""You're the trouble I've been looking for,"" at any second. It's followed by the album's closer, ""The Labour Day Parade,"" though, an instrumental with a slightly dubby feel that ranks as one of the groups' most interesting offerings, even if it can't quite hold my attention all the way through. When the laser slides back across its track and the disc stops spinning, nothing really lingers, except perhaps for the somewhat gauzy feeling induced by the synthesizers. Through Small Windows proves so utterly innocuous that it's hard to imagine anyone having any sort of opinion about it one way or another. In the future, Alsace Lorraine could use a little more Maginot Line in their sound-- something prickly or at least a little challenging to latch on to. For now, their music is the rough equivalent of leaving your Corn Flakes in the milk for too long, and these flakes have turned into one big lump of mush. Sure, you could eat it, but why would you want to?","It's amazing the difference one little hyphen can make. Consider: Alsace-Lorraine is a region in France, lying west of ...

Vulcan,Satoko Fujii Quartet,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be5c5e6ef95969323238/1:1/w_160/bd7f19d1.gif,2002-01-14 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3245-vulcan/,Libra,"Japanese pianist Satoko Fujii came about this the hard way. That is, she started playing the way you're supposed to: learning etudes, playing scales, practicing all the correct fingerings, being as precise as humanly possible. It's enough to drive you mad, and I suppose that explains why so many concert pianists have hair like Dudley Moore and talk like... well, Dudley Moore. Fujii started down this path, only to hit a brick wall about 20 years into the game. So, she gave it up for communal stomp-n-yell sessions and cathartic group improv. The end. Nope. After a year of gathering her wits, she decided jazz was where it was at, and returned to her studied piano with a different aim. She went back to taking lessons, but this time with renowned Japanese jazz pianist Fumio Itabashi. Of course, her parents didn't approve of the new direction, so Fujii struck out on her own. She eventually left for America, to study at Berklee College of Music, graduating in 1987. She went back to Japan, and made a humble rep by playing in jazz clubs and on television and commercial soundtracks. The end. Not quite. A few years later, Fujii was accepted to the New England Conservatory of Music, from which she received a Graduate Degree in Jazz Performance in 1996. There, she had the opportunity to learn from greats like Paul Bley, Cecil McBee and George Russell. Her first album even featured Bley, and many had a difficult time recognizing who was playing at what point, such was her stylistic advancement. Today, having worked with new jazz luminaries like Mark Dresser, Jim Black, Mark Feldman, and big bands from both New York and Japan, Fujii is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese jazz musicians alive. And she is living happily ever after. The end. But this is not the end. The deal is, despite the ridiculous amount of jazz preparation and education Fujii seems to have had, her latest release, Vulcan, barely sounds like jazz at all. What's the story? You'd think that when your biggest reference points are supposed to be folks like Bley and Myra Melford that your album wouldn't initially remind you of avant-proggers like the Soft Machine or the Muffins (Cuneiform Records: check 'em). We're talking extra-hard drumming and improv that often is so off the beaten path I keep waiting for the quartet (Fujii, trumpeter Natsuki Tamura, bassist Takeharu Hayakawa, and drummer-god Tatsuya Yoshida) to implode rather than work through the storms, and come out standing, as they do like clockwork every time. And this is most certainly not an end, but yet another incredible beginning from Fujii. Vulcan begins with the epic ""The Sun in a Moonlight Night"" and Yoshida's guttural shaman vocals, accompanied by Tamura's electric/underwater horn and some elastic bass fingerprints scattered here and there. Soon, Fujii joins the mini-ruckus by pretending to be Cecil Taylor for a time, though always in the background. So, yes, this is what they call ""free jazz,"" or in some quarters, ""noodling."" But then a funny thing happens: Yoshida drops a beat, and Fujii drops a riff, and it becomes what they call ""super-rock."" And it remains this for a whole two minutes or so before changing into a number from Bizet's Carmen (if it was a bass solo). Then, Yoshida crashes through the wall where most jazz drummers would ""hint at pulse"" or ""play around time"" or some such non-jam strategy. Soon, it's Fujii taking the solo over the massive beats and bass bombs. And then it's Tamura (Fujii's husband) soloing, and-- wait, did that solo section last about ten minutes without me even once looking at my watch? Yes, yes it did. At the end, they come back to the head, and this is why it's easy to tell people 15-minute tunes aren't necessarily bad. ""Incident"" begins like a lopsided Jackson Pollock painting; all scribble haze impressions and stop/start horn utterances with bass and erratic drumming. Then, the ""song"" proper starts, though the head is arguably even less stable than the exposition, with the beat changing as often as the notes in the melody. It's sometimes difficult to tell where the soloing starts and the melody begins, but that doesn't keep the tune from jamming, if only in the abstract-dyslexia jam sense. Another punchy bass solo begins ""Ninepin,"" and just like before, it seems to only obscure the true intentions of this tune. Soon, the solo falls onto a pedal note, and Yoshida ushers in his ominous toms and cymbals. Fujii enters with a vaguely Eastern European head, doubled by Tamura. This is something like that made famous by the NYC clique-mongers John Zorn (with Masada) and Chris Speed (solo and with Pachora), but a sight more rock where theirs was stark swinging and even harmelodic. Here, after a lengthy group exposition, Fujii solos over a relatively restrained (though increasingly kinetic as it progresses) backdrop, and it can still be said that Yoshida is the world's most hyperactive drummer. In fact, soon his cymbal rolls and snare blasts dominate the section--] so much so that the tune morphs into a drum solo. Without launching into a treatise on the greatness of Yoshida, I will say that even after a decade of incredible Ruins' releases, his playing here is surprisingly fresh, both in its single-minded forcefulness, and by the way he effortlessly shifts back into the main head of the tune. ""Footstep"" and ""Neko no Yume"" are both quieter entries on a release that seems to specialize in that which pounds and sprawls. The former features dark, atmospheric playing from Fujii over light cymbal work and bowed bass howls in the distance, and it probably wouldn't sound out of place in a tense ghost story soundtrack. The latter is more straightforward, with Tamura and Hayakawa playing the real late-night, smoky jazz dope Chet Baker gets so much credit for (when it was probably Miles Davis all along). In any case, the tune reminds me of nobody so much as Dave Douglas (though Tamura doesn't quite possess his technical facility), particularly in its juxtaposition of classic cool with modern squawk. The rest of Vulcan is devoted to much more aggressive aesthetics: ""LH Fast"" is Ruins-style jump-cut avant-rock; ""Untitled"" fools you into thinking it will be an introspective piano ballad, but is in fact an extroverted, Iberian-flavored romp. And the last tune, ""Junction,"" spells out to anyone who wasn't paying attention that this album is about fast and loud jams. Of course, an hour of that can become taking to the ears, and it helps that these guys bring it all back home fairly quickly in the tunes more often than not. This quartet has been playing live together since 1998, and it'll be interesting to see if they continue to release stuff together. There are very few working jazz groups that demand the attention of the rock audience at the moment. This is certainly no slight on today's jazz artists, but it would seem that the demographic gap between jazz and rock is bigger than it was, say, 25 years ago. Fujii is one of a handful of artists (including the aforementioned Zorn, Black, Speed, and Douglas) who would seem to have as many potential fans in the rock world as jazz. Things like raw energy and inspiration have never been exclusive to any musical genre, and it would be a shame if the inspired creativity I hear on this album was only heard by a few jazz critics and Japanese music fans.","Japanese pianist Satoko Fujii came about this the hard way.

Dawn Refuses to Rise,Elders of Zion,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2aea9e61561daa73f9/1:1/w_160/6a830ac7.jpg,2002-01-13 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2721-dawn-refuses-to-rise/,Incidental,"The dark ambient: often, we have hard beats and harder politics (buried or not in the mix), with the vocals most often piped in via DAT or found sound. We have guitars, but they're usually not playing like guitars, opting for figures more remote and abstract than anthemic. And how the synthesizers will drone on, like troubled waters raging beneath all the distorted calm and alien footwork by which the faceless soldiers who articulate this music traverse. Above all, I would say this kind of trip goes against the nature of non-aggressive expression, because when you're playing stuff that's more likely to scare your constituents than sooth them, chances are that your music will only get played by folks as dark or darker than you. This means that whatever hard politics or soft terror you want to transmit is probably doomed to one-to-one transmissions rather than grassroots, populist revolution. Okay, so dark ambient music may not be so inherently subversive at heart, but when I think of many of its major proponents-- GYBE!, Keiji Haino, Richard Pinhas, KK Null, Nurse with Wound-- I usually do think of spooky, ultra-serious ex-noise-shamans who would sooner set fire to a government building than flash a smile. And that much of this music features the beamed-in sounds of samples, field recordings and industrial commotion doesn't exactly lend it the human touch. Of course, that may be the point entirely. San Francisco's Elders of Zion-- comprised of co-conspirators Joel Schalit (current editor of Punk Planet and ex-Christal Methodist) and Asphodel Records engineer Vance Galloway-- use these hallowed techniques to great effect, seemingly to raise awareness of some brand of leftist political rhetoric (though, the impression of this is more evident than an actual agenda set forth). Now, if revolution were the goal, then it would make sense not to muddy the message with atonal atmospherics, but to just come out and state your claims. However, if you just wanted to put a little scare on people, then records like Dawn Refuses to Rise would make a lot more sense. There's something ominous on the horizon, and I can't quite make out what it is, but it's bad, it's got serious politics and it's going to get you. Elders of Zion make their racket with traditional rock instrumentation (put through gosh knows how many layers of post-production), and a library of spoken word samples, ranging from American protest demonstrations to Israeli children to Godard-obsessed French Maoists. If that sounds a bit heavy to you, well, it is; but then the music, albeit dark, is never really angry or even all that loud, so if you felt like tuning it out, you probably could. The title track wastes no time in painting it all black with screeching guitar lines and orchestras of basses and synths and big drums, like the weird outro groove of the Beatles' ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and an imaginary soundtrack to airplanes landing. Next: ""Future Avant-Garde Society,"" despite being a lot faster, is exactly as thick and suffocating as the previous tune. Throughout the record, the band emphasizes their ability to turn any groove into a nightmarish vamp. There's a sample in this one that goes, ""The best noisemakers are not necessarily the best peacemakers."" Damn right. Elsewhere, things get a tad more chemically enhanced. ""#1 in Gaza This Week,"" with its siren-effects and pounding, reverb-laden beat, could be some kind of tone-poem for inner-city strife (or some such relevant issue), but mostly just seems like an acid test gone awry. I could say the same for ""Eject the Push Button Punks,"" ""Rubber Bullet Rock"" and ""Like a Fish Out of Water,"" which modify the lysergic groove with hi-speed d-n-b beats, reggae skank and sheer sonic pummeling via a restless snare and a manic electro-drone from synthesizer and guitar. The biggest issue I have with this record is that the best parts (hard beats, endless arrays of psyche-effects and apocalyptic feedback) can become a bit mindnumbing after a while, to the point that they end becoming the worst parts. Drummer Luis Illades must have permanent bruises on his fingers from these sessions, and I would hate to have co-leaders Joel Schalit and Vance Galloway's eardrums, voluntarily subjected to hours of militant protest field recordings and far gone space effects. Again, it's not really that loud, but they just never let up. If you can handle the trip, Dawn Refuses to Rise can be a rather fascinating travel guide for journeys into the outer regions.","The dark ambient: often, we have hard beats and harder politics (buried or not in the mix), with the vocals ...

Feel No Fade,Push Kings,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15c9d034d5c69bf2942/1:1/w_160/a2bde716.gif,2002-01-13 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6516-feel-no-fade/,Le Grand Magistery,"Contrary to what you may believe, it's hard to achieve a ranking this low. Your friends at Pitchfork have an 87.9% successful suckage spotter. And though there are occasionally some oversights-- both artists and critics have bad days-- we're ultimately on your side, kid. There are some things you shouldn't have time or money appropriating. In fact, there are (and I believe this, deeply) some things you just shouldn't have to hear. The Push Kings' Feel No Fade is rife with unanswered questions. Like, for example, why a mediocre indie pop quartet hates its audience so much that they would compose and construct this travesty. Or the reasons why the record label green-lighted its release-- mental fogginess due to drugs? Perverse and damaging sense of humor? Mob threats? It's anyone's guess. But they better have a pretty fucking good excuse. I really wish I had never, ever heard this. The thing is, I've been in a pretty good mood lately-- ordinary ups and downs of life notwithstanding-- and summoning up the mass of vitriol necessary for eviscerating this album the way it should be has required a considerable sacrifice of peace of mind on my part. I figure this for a humanitarian gesture. Save yourself. This album is so awful it hurt my feelings. Feel No Fade is appallingly glossy, insipid, vacuous cheese-puff pop music. So bad it warrants negative musical comparisons to such luminaries as Third Eye Blind and Matchbox 20. Apt description would necessitate me believing that there are more offensive and grotesque lapses of aesthetic judgment than the entirety of Rob Thomas' career. In order to convey my physical reaction to this album, I'd have to draw up analogies to eating tablespoons of mayonnaise on an empty stomach after drinking a six-pack of peach flavored wine coolers. And frankly, that's not a leap I'm terribly excited about taking. The supposed ideal audience for this album currently lives on a lackluster block of neutral-toned tract mansions in the suburbs of some forgettable, brass-and-glass, corporate banking metropolis. Her name is Ashley. She is thirteen years old, and has recently become disillusioned with Britney Spears. She dreams of turning sixteen years old, so she can get a brand new bubblegum pink convertible, no, jeep, no, convertible, with fuzzy leopard print seat covers and a matching cell phone. And perhaps, she can get a fun job at Abercrombie and Fitch for the employee discounts and access to ""like, totally hot college boys"" on summer break. She already knows which sorority she wants to pledge Freshman year of college, and thinks Creed is ""a little too hardcore for me."" Somehow or another, her best friend (and captain of the Junior High Cheerleading Squad) gets passed a copy of Feel No Fade, and it becomes the soundtrack to Ashley's life. Her long-suffering, indulgent yuppie mom is forced to play track six, ""Honey Come Closer,"" on the way to school every morning so her daughter can bounce along and imagine ""totally hot"" (but nothing below the neck) romantic encounters with guys that look like Pacey from ""Dawson's Creek."" Ashley and her friends paint their nails at slumber parties and choreograph amateur dance moves to ""Beat Girl (and Me)."" And she knows all the words to ""Summer Trippin',"" and pulls her boombox into the bathroom to sing to the cute ""doo-doo-doo"" chorus while showering. And sometimes she stands in the bedroom mirror wondering if her stomach will ever be as thin as the tanned, tattooed female torso which serves as the cover art for Feel No Fade. She thinks maybe she would like to date one of the Push Kings. Unfortunately, sometime around Ashley's fourteenth birthday, her interest starts to wane. Maybe the sparkling clean, sugar-coated guitar line in ""Rocket N' Time"" starts to sound a bit tired on the 400th listen. Or maybe, despite their best intentions, the Push Kings fail to interest the geniuses in charge of soundtracking the next WB teen drama. Or maybe she starts dating her next-door neighbor-- a barely post-voice change fifteen-year-old boy. He introduces her to Jimmy Eat World, which, compared to the Push Kings, is deeply complex, profoundly moving, seriously hardcore, and fraught with dangerous sexuality. I usually think pure pop music is unfairly scorned. It's what it is: an idle, easy upper, analogous to pixie stix or cake icing. It can be addictive, but that's usually tempered by our collective inability to digest that much sugar without uncomfortable side effects. Even the most pretentious music snob can be counted on for the occasional foray into the pastel-hued and candy-coated. Ignore their impossibly lame defenses and justifications; pop music is great because you can like it without really having to explain why. That being said, Feel No Fade makes a strong case for strict eye-for-an-eye justice, allowing all unwilling victims of its soul-sucking, commercial banality the privilege of publicly shaming their favorite Push King. There is absolutely no excuse for this shit.","Contrary to what you may believe, it's hard to achieve a ranking this low. Your friends at Pitchfork have ...

"Texture, Structure and the Condition of Moods",Fin Fang Foom,by: David M.

To this day, for all our technical know-how and scientific explorations, we still understand very little about how it works. Still, there's no denying its amazing capabilities. From sheer storage capability and the power for reasoning, to the oft-discussed theories of telepathy and the strange but undeniably incredible stunts of your average savant, it seems the brain's powers are close to endless. Perhaps its most amazing feat of all, though, is its ability to convince itself of things it simply knows cannot be true. Like the urban legends about an alcoholic woman with nothing else to live for who carries around her dead baby, cradling it and cooing its name, convinced it's still alive. Or the child who watches his father beat his mother, but chooses not to acknowledge it, finding it easier to believe it never happened than to deal with the repercussions. Or the thirty-year-old man who insists that professional wrestling is real. Or the music critic that convinces himself that there's no vocalist in Fin Fang Foom. And why not? The music on Texture, Structure, and the Condition of Moods is interesting, if not necessarily innovative. Granted, this guitar/bass/drums rock trio is hung up on that whole juxtaposition of the fast and slow, and the abrasive and quiet. And yes, they've been duped into thinking a Casio keyboard part here and there will make them seem sensitive. Still, the instrumentation is competent, and on occasion, some of these songs are even sort of interesting. Fin Fang Foom might not be up to the U.S. Maple standard for disjointed rock music, but they're certainly a step up from most of the generic crap that ends up festering in my review pile for weeks on end. Certainly, a decent group like this would recognize the good things they've got going for them, and wouldn't go and fuck everything up by adding vocals, right? Especially not really retching, grating, off-key vocals that bring to mind that forbidden e-word. Nope. There's just no reason. And certainly, they wouldn't have an equally incompetent back-up vocalist, showing up from time to time to take things from bad to simply unbearable. Nah, they'd know better. And even if, for some godforsaken reason, they insisted on adding vocals, certainly they'd manage to find something less cliché than, oh, I dunno, ""Angel love, why so thin and pale?/ Don't you realize your soul is for sale?"" Right? They would, wouldn't they? It seems safe to say that any group competent enough to master the tricky stops and starts and the left-field time changes of songs like ""At Age 23"" and ""Iron Coat"" (two of Texture, Structure and the Convocation of Moods' more intriguing moments) would also realize that lyrics like, ""Laughing at my frustration/ Realizing the truth/ No fear of confrontation/ A few more words then we're through,"" are painful in their mediocrity, especially when followed by a refrain that goes, ""I scrape my scars again/ My blood my one best friend."" And so, like an emotionally deranged 15-year-old who fervently insists that there's still a Santa Claus, I maintain that Fin Fang Foom has no vocalist. After all, I don't want to be mean. Contrary to popular belief, we critics don't like writing negative reviews. And these guys do have potential. They're like Sweep the Leg Johnny, just without the saxophone, slightly more structured and a lot less interesting. Maybe one day, they'll recognize the error of their ways, focus on the instrumentals, take the music down that road marked complexity they all seem to be eyeing with a bit of trepidation, and who knows, maybe they'll be worth a recommendation. In the meantime, I'll just continue to enjoy these solid instrumentals thanks to the amazing power of self-deception.","The mind is an amazing thing.

The Lucky Sperms: Somewhat Humorous,Jad FairDaniel Johnston,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd285e6ef95969322fd3/1:1/w_160/8764dfa1.jpg,2002-01-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2956-the-lucky-sperms-somewhat-humorous/,Jagjaguwar,"After about seven years of silence, there's suddenly been a virtual flood of Daniel Johnston material. First, there was last year's surprisingly coherent and successful Rejected Unknown, followed by the reissue of Jad Fair and Daniel Johnston's 1989 collaboration, It's Spooky. A recent Target ad even featured Mary Lou Lord covering his ""Speedy Motorcycle."" And now comes The Lucky Sperms: Somewhat Humorous, the second such joint effort between Texas' favorite Captain America-worshiping troubadour of questionable mental stability and the bespectacled Half Japanese founder and Harry Potter look-a-like Jad Fair. Anyone familiar with the previous collaboration between these two-- or any of their other projects, really-- probably knows what to expect with this one: rag-tag, shambling songs, most sounding half-completed, and judging from the fidelity, recorded on a Talk Boy. The secondary title of this album has it just about right: ""somewhat humorous."" Somewhat annoying, somewhat brilliant, and somewhat scary, are also good ways to describe it. In a lot of ways, The Lucky Sperms sounds pretty tossed-off, interspersing maybe some leftover stuff Johnston recorded during the last seven years with a few random Jad Fair tracks, which isn't a totally bad thing. Johnston, whose material comprises about half the album, starts us off with ""Movie,"" a typical-- and typically moving-- piano-based ode to unrequited love and melancholia. The harrowing ""Death"" follows, offering vivid glimpses into Johnston's idiosyncratic and highly-developed mythic system. Jad, for his part, serves up five noisy, stomping counterparts to Johnston's piano melodies. He also handles the album's production, if you want to call it that. His first contribution, ""Yes, We Can,"" sounds more than a little like a Johnston tune, at least thematically, contemplating Batman's relative power and recalling, ""'What power is in the words,'/ The Byrds asked Bob Dylan."" ""Coffee Cup,"" meanwhile, relates that ""Peter Pan refused to grow up/ I want more coffee in my coffee mug/ If you want treasure you've got to dug/ You've got to dug ya dig?"" And what can you really say about that? A truism if there ever was one. Mid-album, the guys also pull out their covers, including the Beatles' ""Michelle"" and the Stones' ""Ruby Tuesday"" back-to-back. The former is given and laid back with an almost reggae rhythm and the French lyrics hilariously slurred through, and ""Ruby Tuesday"" is given a barrelhouse piano reading by Johnston. Near the end of the album, they throw together a medley of standards and not-so-standards called ""Melody,"" featuring bits and pieces of ""On Top of Old Smokey,"" Simon and Garfunkel's ""Bridge over Troubled Water,"" Aerosmith's ""Take Me to the Other Side,"" ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Ding-Dong the Wicked Witch is Dead,"" among others. But even these pleasures are short lived. They're enjoyable enough in the moment, but like the album as a whole, I can't say I'll be making the return trip very often.","After about seven years of silence, there's suddenly been a virtual flood of Daniel Johnston material.

Agit Itter It It EP,Mouse on Mars,by: David M.

See, it's not that Agit Itter It It is all that bad; by anyone else's standards it's pretty excellent work. But after such a long, distinguished string of releases, culminating in last year's much-lauded Idiology, the five tracks contained here are kind of a letdown. Most Mouse on Mars albums use the ideas of the previous one as a launching point for the exploration of new sonic territory. And while the sounds used to construct the songs on Agit Itter It It do bear a strong resemblance to those on Idiology (and were likely created during the same sessions), they've clearly been made b-sides for a reason. ""Milleader"" is somewhat interesting, finding Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner juggling jagged samples, bleating synths, programmed beats and assorted other noises with the expertise of first-class Powerbookers. Unfortunately, this isn't the case elsewhere. ""Untitled States Of"" is built around a distorted keyboard loop and a few repeated guitar riffs. As the song progresses, a bass part and sequenced percussion find their way into the mix while assorted layers of noise hover above. Problem is, the beats holding it together are somewhat repetitive and generic (at least by the standard set in the duo's previous work), and the occasional pitchshifting and feedback fails to make that distinction between any old IDM track and Mouse on Mars mastery. More telling still: by far the most interesting track on Agit Itter It It, entitled ""Moral Sack It,"" is no more than a minute long. A handful of trumpets enter and fade, leaving behind garbled electronic feedback in their wake like a path of slime following a snail, before giving way to the fractured beat that begins the next song. While little more than a transition, this is the only moment on the EP that truly demonstrates the kind of ingenuity present in the majority of Mouse on Mars' work. In fact, the real highlight here is not the EP at all, but the live seven-inch that comes packaged with the disc's first pressing. Toma and St. Werner have gained a reputation as the best live performers in the electronic world, offering live instrumentation and an intriguing visual setup rather than relying on the standard guy/table/laptop scenario that characterizes most IDM shows. The addition of live drums, vocals from Dodo Nkishi, and other instrumentation to the usual laptops and sequencers allows these guys to reinterpret their work in ways that most electronic acts cannot. But they do more than just add a voice and manipulate some beat structures. The passion and energy driving the live version of ""Actionist Respoke"" here is undeniably human, replacing the alien aesthetic of the original with something different, yet oddly familiar. Though a live recording is typically a weak substitute for honest-to-god new music, these two cuts work better than anything presented on the EP. Perhaps in the end, the best way to explain Agit Itter It It is the old-fashioned way: it's an EP. And like most EPs, Agit Itter It It ultimately gets branded with the dubious ""for completists only"" stamp. If you don't already have a vast collection of Mouse on Mars' proper albums, your well-earned funds will be better spent elsewhere.","As much as I don't want to admit it, the new Mouse on Mars EP is just going through ...

Chips from the Chocolate Fireball,The Dukes of Stratosphear,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba30c0084474cd0c27b9/1:1/w_160/48e2a3db.jpg,2002-01-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2475-chips-from-the-chocolate-fireball/,VirginVirgin,"Sometime during the stone-grey early months of 1985, the members of XTC stumbled upon a time portal manifested in the form of a wardrobe in Captain Sensible's cobbled and thatched suburban London cottage. What the band was doing there no one can say, but as they stepped inside the portal, making their way past row after row of paisley frocks and multi-hued, four-in-hand ties, they were transported to the year 1967, emerging from the WC of a downtown go-go club. As luck would have it, the club's house band was absent that particular evening (all four had fallen ill with mononucleosis), so the lads in XTC had no trouble convincing management to allow them to take the stage. Having committed a fair share of the era's repertoire to memory, they (aided on drums by guitarist David Gregory's brother Ian, who happened to be with the band that fateful morn at the wardrobe) won the crowd over easily, and it wasn't long before they secured some studio time. Christening themselves the Dukes of Stratosphear, and renaming themselves individually as Sir John Johns (Partridge), the Red Curtain (Moulding), Lord Cornelius Plum (David Gregory), and E.I.E.I. Owen (Ian Gregory), the band whipped up an EP's and an LP's worth of dainty psychedelic pop songs, inspired like no other time in their careers. The Dukes were truly of their era, yet wholly XTC-- whimsical, bright, and trippy, but also wry, subtly sarcastic (even time travel couldn't change that), and sophisticated. It was as if they themselves were inventing the very band that would later inspire and influence their proper albums. Fortunately, before they were suddenly and unexpectedly jerked back to 1985 in the middle of a rehearsal, the Dukes had the foresight to hide their session tapes under a stack of Pat Boone records at a local shop, and there they remained until XTC could pick them back up during the Thatcher administration. The EP, 25 O'Clock, was released later that year, while the remaining ten tracks came out two years later on the Psonic Psunspot LP. Both were eventually collected in their entirety on Chips from the Chocolate Fireball, which has been recently reissued by Virgin. The above story must be what happened. What else could explain this prime, vintage psychedelia, released during the decidedly un-psych mid-1980s? What else could explain songs like ""Bike Ride to the Moon,"" with lines like, ""And we'll pack a tent 'cause it's cold at night/ And I'll share your sleeping bag if I might/ And might be a positive boon/ To protect you from the man in the moon""? (The Small Faces couldn't have put it better.) And how to explain the lack of much, if any, of the stench of 80s production values? You might think this is a pure joke project on the order of Spinal Tap's ""Listen to the Flower People,"" but play this album alongside, say, Pink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets or the Zombies' Odessey and Oracle, and you'll find that, parody or not, it's a great collection of songs that more than measures up. To put it bluntly, if you can only have one XTC album (by presidential mandate or something), this is the one. That's not a jab at XTC; they've delivered more than their fair share of outstanding releases in their day-- English Settlement and Skylarking, to name only two-- but there's always been a handful of mediocre songs on each album that could stay or go. Not here. All 16 are kaleidoscopic pop gems. It stands as a testament to the band's quirky genius that their loving parody/tribute side project just happens to be responsible for the best music they've ever made.","Sometime during the stone-grey early months of 1985, the members of XTC stumbled upon a time portal manifested in the ...

Go. Go ahead and try to find all the Boredoms-related projects. I dare you. While you're at it, why don't you get another job, because most of the super-rare releases by these units will run you about $35 a pop. Boredoms Marketing has got the whole supply-and-demand thing down, so why would they ever bother with distribution? But that's overly cynical: as with most impulsively creative musicians, these people just never stop working. Oh yes, there's also OOIOO. The Boredoms connection here is drummer/trumpet player Yoshimi P-We. The O-band is something of a solo project for Yoshimi, as she produces everything and writes most of the music (along with her partners Kyoto, Maki and Yoshiko). They have three albums, and each one sounds progressively similar to recent Boredoms, with plenty of electronic fiddling and space-age sun-crash drum stomp-- but, with the major difference being Yoshimi doesn't take Eye's scenic route as a means, via extended warp drive exploration and jungle hunt. OOIOO's journey always ends up closer to pop than Boredoms, with a penchant for new wave chic and boisterous, sing-song melodies. Shock City Shockers 2 (on Eye's Shock City imprint) is comprised of remixes of tunes from the band's three previous albums, and one new tune, ""Open Your Eyes You Can Fly"" (which actually sticks out a little on this release, not featuring the electronic wizardry of the others). The cast assembled to re-stir the mixtures is itself a mixture of old Bore cohorts and new characters, but there's something that nags me about the release in general. It's not that the music isn't interesting to listen to-- there are lots of headphone-friendly details, and sonic logic games to play. It's just that I can't help but think that, since OOIOO's albums always seemed at least a step away from greatness, and since they always seemed to be in debt to the recent Boredoms sound rather than an extension of it, injecting them with electric steroids is misleading. For me, most of the music on this album sounds better than the originals. Take that as you will. ""Tenkuteku Tune/Mountain Book"" (two tunes from the 2000 release Gold and Green) is a very nice way to begin the album. We have a sine wave (courtesy of remixer Zak) floating over the top of the speakers, announcing the heady arrival of sunny, ambient flange-guitar and light synth. It's conceptually similar to the last track from Boredoms' Super Ae, and placing such an offhandedly warm track at the beginning is a daring move. How could you follow something so completely at ease? Hmmm. Later on, semi-hyperactivity rears its head. Another, very different version of ""Mountain Book"" (remixed by Chari Chari) features a kinetic drum loop, somewhat like a techno Indian raga beat, and Yoshimi's echo-ridden vocals sent to all corners of the mix. ""Asozan"" (from Feather Float) is given the rolling tom treatment by remixer Eye. Beginning with restless marimba, all cartoonish Steve Reich motives and insistent pulse, it moves on to a fairly detached double-tracked Yoshimi vocal, again sent to various points. ""Kinorokujyouressya,"" reworked by frequent Bore-collaborator Kiyoshi Izumi, actually gets fairly close to straight techno with a bouncy, breakbeaten rhythm and all the hiccup glitch you could want on the dancefloor. Other tracks are quite restrained: ""Unu"" (Green and Gold), remixed by Woodman, is heavy on the 80s drum machine and delayed tremolo guitar, and is virtually without vocals. However, the beat is downplayed in favor of druggy atmospherics-- like the various atonal synthlines you can barely hear in the background-- but which nevertheless give the tune a very tangibly hazy quality. ""Be Sure to Loop"" (Feather Float), remixed by Tatsuki Masuko (of ASLN and Dub Squad fame) begins very similarly to the first tune: all warm, with bells, birds, and typically detached vocals. After several minutes of this, the drums come in, and bingo! It becomes like an outtake from Vision Creation Newsun, with the one-chord guitar vamp over pounding Neu drums and the omnipresent electric effects. Someone in this camp should apply for a patent on this sound, because it's going to get ripped off very soon. If pressed to place this album in a canon with other Boredoms' side projects, I'd reference three: firstly, Eye's DJ Pica Pica Pica release, with which Shock City Shockers 2 shares an affinity for offbeat combinations of melody and rhythm (though this record could never rule a party like the Pica); secondly, the first Shock City Shockers, which was a collection of remixes of several bands' music; and thirdly, Boredoms' 1996 release Super Roots 6, with which it shares a command of ambience and the juxtaposition of simplistic structures and melodies with seemingly complex studio techniques. And while OOIOO's remix album is nice, I would recommend those records first.","On your mark, get set.

The collection holds together stylistically, as none of the nine artists breaks far from sofa-chill mode. But how many more chill-out comps will I have to endure before I find any innovation? The record begins in a slightly clubby mode with UKO's ""Automatic,"" a mid-tempo house tune with a spliffy veneer, excerpted from the band's 2001 self-titled album. Mika's ""Trampolin"" continues the clubby trend with a genteel breakbeat and a horrendous Street Hawk-period Tangerine Dream guitar line. So far, the droopy-eyed set have nothing to fall into their couches over. That's where the Sofa Surfers come in handy. With a track snipped from their forthcoming Encounters album, the Sofa Surfers give toney stoners an anthem with ""River Blues"" featuring the hemped vocals of Jeb Loy Nichols. Nichols' nasal and elongated vocal style works a treat when contrasted with a hi-energy rhythm track, such as the Ewan Pearson Maas disco remix of Nicols' ""Say Goodbye to Christopher."" But never has a singer described their own style more aptly as when Nicols sings about muddy water on this soporific track. Albin Janoska tries to emulate Fat Jon the Ample Soul Physician with a head-bobbing instrumental hip-hop tune called ""Lem""-- soon to be adored by seldom-bathing, sandal-wearing Eurorailers. ""Lem"" has the perfect balance of low-end theory and quivering strings, garnished with a self-important, tinkling piano line. Probably splendid after a eighth, if I'm feeling charitable. Markus Kienzl connects with the dub shacks of yore on ""Top Dog"" and scores the highlight of this disc. After unleashing echoes, Kienzl lets rip a bassline that should have turned up on Billy Cobham's plundered Spectrum LP. With minimal percussive adornment, Kienzl lets the bassline suck you in for five minutes. The only vocals here sound suspiciously sampled from Paul McCartney's count-in intro to the reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" processed to sound like a really baked person fumbling their way to the number four. Then comes a track from Seelenluft, a guy with a penchant for dressing up in bunny costumes for his public appearances. Here, he chimes in with more fumbling nonsense on ""Manila,"" in which an uncredited vocalist hollers about dancing without a seatbelt before someone with an amateur urge to be John McLaughlin cuts her off with his ham-fisted display of plank-spanking. I do like ""Manila,"" by the way. Its goofiness redeems it, and if nothing else, it beats the piss out of the following track, ""Son of a Gun."" ""Son of a Gun"" is by Mum (not the Icelandic applied IDM band, but some duo sorely lacking in dignity), and it's another contribution to that already swollen cliché, the hollerin' bluesman sampled and pasted into an incongruous mid-tempo house track. Mum at least altered the guitar-line to sound like some sort of oud or gourd monochord, and thereby making some statement about the West African roots of the blues. Or perhaps Mum thought that gourd-fashioned monochords somehow convey a hollerin' man's son-of-a-gun status more effectively that a plain ol' guitar. Humbucker's ""Thrill Jockey,"" rather than traipsing into the mines of originality, opts to emulate Linkin Park. And then, Lichtenberg's ""El Duke,"" with a mass of iconic Latin and spaghetti western signifiers, thankfully releases us from xFC-metal Valhalla. But for all the cha-cha maracas and hornblasts, the song sounds nothing less than incidental music from a ""Star Trek"" fight sequence between James T. Kirk and some malevolent snaggle-toothed alien beastie. Should go down well at your next office party, then. Sincerely Yours (a title which must clearly be in doubt after this motley array of tracks) closes superbly with a new version of Seelenluft's ""Music for the Stars."" Hardly different from the blissful Ultramarine-as-a-Wurlitzer-outfit version that appeared on last year's Synchronschwimmer-EP, the track deftly highlights what Klein is capable of releasing when not bogged down in forgettable fodder for the trust-funded stoners-about-town.","Sincerely Yours is a compilation of previously released, exclusive and\n\ advance material from the roster of Klein Records, a ...

Action Chemistry,Karp,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7213d197565213b0bf/1:1/w_160/6ee7b68d.jpg,2002-01-09 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4391-action-chemistry/,Punk in My Vitamins,"It's late 1995. You're a couple months shy of twenty years old, and though technically a college student, you can't remember the last time you attended a class. You spend your evenings driving back and forth to the well-known college town approximately 45 miles to the east of your current residence for name musical events, or attend loud, sloppy punk rock shows at a dilapidated house two blocks from your own mediocre state university. You know the place, right? Some fall-down joint with a rotting front porch overflowing with rusty bicycles and mildewed sofas. You're not really sure who's paying rent, or if anyone is paying rent at all. The place smells like shit, and the show attendees drive you crazy with their politics and gratuitous displays of testosterone (chances are, if you're female, you're the clear minority), but it's better than bickering with your roommate over rent, and every now and then you have a really great time. It's the messy nostalgia factor, and Karp's posthumous singles collection, Action Chemistry, reminds me of all the sweaty, drunken nights I spent trying like hell to not get trampled, and the times I surprised everyone (though mostly myself) when I loudly declared during the silence at the end of the show, ""Goddamn, that fucking rocked."" I didn't see Karp in 1995. The bands I saw then were usually loud, but lacking both musical proficiency and a sense of humor. Karp was endowed with an impressive amount of both. Much has been made of their metal influences-- think the bastard child of the Melvins and Black Sabbath, occasionally joined by a hardcore-loving session musician with an affinity for uppers, Black Flag, and Animal from ""The Muppet Show""-- and as for the humor thing, well, it's hard not to like a band that adds a detail like this in the liner notes: ""Recorded with a live bear in the studio. That was tough."" In fact, disliking this band is difficult when you find yourself raising the devil horns and headbanging in earnest to ""Turkey Named Brotherhood,"" with its dead-on fucking metal guitar line and unintelligible screamed vocals. It's hard not to laugh. And it's okay, because you know Karp is laughing with you. In their day, Karp were notorious for their wrestling-wear, and lyrical allusions to The Wizard of Oz and the roller derby. They recorded three full-lengths for K, attracted some rather high-profile fans within the music community (Built to Spill's Doug Martsch has been spotted wearing Karp t-shirts on numerous occasions), and allowed their fans the pleasure of balls-out rock and roll absurdity without having to prefix the pleasure with ""guilty."" Consider the opener, ""Rowdy,"" the first track on Karp's last EP. A completely brutal, totally hilarious alcoholic older cousin of the Fucking Champs' progged-out meditations on the same genre, this track makes terrific use of its technical intricacy, never wiping the smirk off its face. With Karp, the silliness factor tempers the bombast just enough that you can sit back on second listen and enjoy the hodgepodge of sounds beneath the noise without feeling like too much of a hesher. Both ""Dusk"" and ""Blue Blood"" employ the dirge-to-explosion, quiet/loud dynamics of the artier set, but allow for all the strutting metal affectations to seep through. Likewise, the speed metal uproar of ""Gauze"" resolves itself into a raucous classic rock kind of conclusion, which would be completely preposterous if not for its defiantly lo-fi sound. The album fills out with a virtually unintelligible Black Flag cover, ""Nothing Left Inside,"" and the terrifically titled ""I'd Rather Be Clogging,"" with its slow-to-build, full-on guitar assault at the conclusion. Action Chemistry might lack subtlety, but that's sort of the point, isn't it? I mean, if you're looking for breezy, complex pop songs, this obviously isn't the place to go. This is not music for the Merlot crowd. It's loud and unruly, and if they ever invent scratch-and-sniff CDs, this one would smell like the interior of a shitty dive the morning after an amateur cock-rock show. But the damn thing charmed me. Something about undistilled rock without the bells and whistles. Something about being sure these guys had a lot of fun doing this. Something about the way it makes me want to stock my pockets with cheap beer and go to a bad house show just to make sure I'm not missing anything really great. Goddamn, that fucking rocked.","It's late 1995.

Carousel,Victory at Sea,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95a13d1975652139851/1:1/w_160/5282f328.jpg,2002-01-09 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8469-carousel/,Kimchee,"I don't get the indie rock fetish for nautical imagery. It's usually not even appropriate-- June of 44's punchy sound was far from the fluid motions of naval life. Rachel's epic The Sea and the Bells must have marked a turning point, because since then, I admit to having heard a diffusion of its effects in Louisville-related projects like the Shipping News. But then there are bands like Volta Do Mar, whose knife-sharp transmissions are more appropriate for a turn on the highway than the sea. Maybe Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" and Rush's ""Red Barchetta"" forever closed that road to the scene. Victory at Sea argue otherwise on Carousel. The vibe on the trio's second full-length shifts without warning from warmth to biting cold, and on the most emotionally gripping songs, lyrical hints of road-trip imagery are tied to the breakup of a relationship. It's dark rock in the vein of the Afghan Whigs; I'm thinking particularly of the guest vocals of Scrawl's Marcy Mays on ""My Curse."" Victory at Sea frontwoman Mona Elliott croons with a similar ache on the opener, ""Third Place."" Her guitar meanders softly with shuffling percussion in the beginning as she sings, ""From one place to another, not one word to each other."" Drummer Fin Moore and bassist Mel Lederman weave rolling rhythms together, accelerating into a fiery chorus as Elliott admits that she can't repress memory forever. Elliott's voice also reminds me of a sweeter Thalia Zedek, short of a few thousand packs of cigarettes. Turns out to be an appropriate connection-- Lederman played piano on Zedek's Been Here and Gone, and Zedek returns the favor in the company of a chorus of women for the conclusion of ""The Open Road."" Moore proves his prodigious skill on this song, cycling through a series of rolls and crashes like an eight-armed Vedic god, his propulsion only enhanced by the brooding plod of the bass. ""The sun hit the windshield like a rock from the sky,"" Elliott remembers, her only lyric in the song. Then, the inevitable pause, patience, and the soaring chorus and climax that never fails to send a chill up my spine. Whereas the previous songs begin at one destination and end entirely at another, ""The Blizzard of '78"" is Victory at Sea's most ""pop"" song. Elliott's guitar chimes almost cheerily as she describes her street, buried in snow: ""The sun, it reflected from the ice to the windows and antennas from the cars shot through the new, higher ground; it was the last time I remember us together."" Two verses, two choruses, and then a punchy melody at the ending that will leave you humming for hours but unsure whether you're happy or just damned miserable. Too bad every song can't quite match that lyricism. ""The Driver"" builds well, with a bluesy riff and shimmering cymbals. Moore kicks in, transforming the piece to a stomping rocker, but Elliott loses steam: ""You can drive much faster than me/ I am sometimes much older."" But the rest of the songs lead the listener through more convoluted paths. ""Angel"" opens with a muted trumpet, and amidst the slow, tense rhythm, Elliott sings of ""wings homemade, crocheted out of hearts"" of the other jealous angels. The song cuts short before more can be revealed, but likewise, on the closer, ""Mermaid,"" she warns that ""they need water to breathe""-- but the water has spilled out. You don't need to flesh out these curious figures to enjoy the turbulent drums and scraping feedback on this final track. ""Remember,"" two tracks before, might have been a more appropriate closer, though, with Lederman's electric piano echoing like a bittersweet Disintegration ballad. I worry that my words haven't done justice to this excellent album. Just imagine a cold winter in the band's hometown of Boston, and all the icy intensity and seasonal weariness that might entail. In case it wasn't obvious, this is one for the road.","I don't get the indie rock fetish for nautical imagery. It's usually not even appropriate-- June of 44 ...

Cold House,Hood,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c115ea9e61561daa7d13/1:1/w_160/d68ebced.jpg,2002-01-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3917-cold-house/,Aesthetics,"Remember when MTV was still that little renegade music channel? I vividly recall sitting in front of the TV when I was a kid, entranced for hours by Twisted Sister, Def Leppard, and Quiet Riot videos. And though I wasn't entirely sure about what was going on in front of my eyes, I was fascinated all the same. To think that there were places where grown men ran around in make-up and spandex and still managed to kick total rock ass. These were guys that acted completely insane, yet took themselves seriously and were fawned over by women everywhere. As a child, it was like a portal into a strange parallel universe where all of my small town values were inverted. Then there was the other breed of MTV musician: synth-pop guys who seemed more like real artist types and didn't seem to be concerned as much with making a fantastic testosterone-soaked spectacle of themselves as creating seductive and melodic music. Naked Eyes, Human League, Talk Talk-- they seemed so cutting edge with their Roland synths and electronic drumpads, and the sounds they created were something entirely new, at least to popular music (sorry, I wasn't listening to Brian Eno and Kraftwerk when I was 10). This was the type of stuff that really interested me. But somewhere along the line, synth-pop began its long estrangement from melody, and electronica began to take over. It started innocuously enough, but soon began incorporating more beat manipulation and studio effects until it was finally twisted into the form known today as IDM. I miss those early days when the technology didn't rule the product, and I think it's time we saw some songwriters doing a little taking back. It's time for a rebirth of synth-pop, wherein all the new innovations in electronic music are employed in the service of melody. As my posterchild for this movement, I select Hood. (I also accept donations.) Cold House takes a fantastic batch of songs and intelligently mixes in cutting edge electronic elements a la Autechre and Nobukazu Takemura, a couple of west coast underground hip-hop artists, and some delicate backing arrangements, and creates one of the most innovative releases of the past year. The biggest surprise on Cold House is the guest spots by Anticon MCs Dose-One and Why?. I'm not sure how Hood hooked up with the San Francisco rappers, but their inclusion here was a brilliant decision. The duo's scat lyrics and drum-n-bass delivery really temper the album, preventing it from becoming too soft at points. Chris Hood's lead vocals aren't very inspiring, falling limply somewhere between Badly Drawn Boy and Bernard Sumner, but by mixing in the slit cut vocals, spoken word and psychobabble riffing, a perfect contrast is created between the them. The album opens promisingly with ""They Removed All Trace That Anything Had Happened Here,"" a nice mix of delicate start/stop clicks, jangly guitar and tasteful cello arrangements. The song splits the vocal sections, starting first with Chris Hood and then handing everything over to Dose-One, who drones over a repeated vocal loop whose compelling nature lies in its unintelligibility. ""You Show No Emotion at All"" kicks off with an unimaginative scratchy beat, but soon picks up with nice trumpet and keyboard fills, revealing itself as the strongest track on the album that strictly features Hood's own vocals. ""With Branches Bare"" thrives on a distended drone that sounds clipped straight from Depeche Mode's Violator. Halfway through, Dose-One hops in with his nasal tone and surreal lyrics: ""We spit in the pond to give the fish something to pray to/ Sometimes the sunset doesn't want to be photographed/ We are no tigers in the picked-bone grasslands."" But the album's standout comes with the closing track, ""You're Worth the Whole World."" It's sung entirely by Dose-One over a low-mixed spoken track, a simple picked guitar progression, and hushed horn keyboards that lead in from the melancholy preceding track, ""Lines Low to a Frozen Ground."" There are some misses in the middle of the album, like ""The River Curls Around This Town,"" a track that, while never really amounting to much, does end with some nice, richly atmospheric electronic gamelan sounds. Indeed, all of the tracks on Cold House-- even the weaker ones-- contribute something of interest. Take, for instance, ""I Can't Find My Brittle Youth,"" which might amount to little more than filler if not for the machine gun drumming that comes out of nowhere and closes the track like John Bonham at 78rpm. Since their inception in 1994, Hood haven't been able to make up their minds what kind of band they want to be. Over the course of their past four albums (not to mention their countless singles, EPs, compilation appearances, remix records, and collections), they've jumped indecisively from genre to genre, experimenting with shoegazer, straightforward indie rock, slowcore, and lo-fi. But with Cold House, Hood seem to have finally stumbled into a sound all their own, melding their countless influences into something totally unique and, at last, giving music fanatics and critics worldwide a reason to look forward to their future releases. Let's hope the payoff is this good next time around.","Remember when MTV was still that little renegade music channel? I vividly recall sitting in front of the TV when ...

Neurotica,Redd Kross,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23bc0084474cd0bffca/1:1/w_160/86c2ecaf.jpg,2002-01-09 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6730-neurotica/,Big TimeBig Time,"One of the most exciting things about being addicted to music is the joy of discovery. It's a ritual that we put ourselves through again and again: scouring the bargain bin for that lost treasure, countless magazines piling up in our rooms, sucked of their suggestive power, and lately, CD-Rs filled with obscurities from a friend's computer. The need for new sounds is as addictive as the music itself, and whether it's the attention paid to overlooked classics, or the apparent demise of the record industry (or both), we addicts are treated to legitimate rediscoveries from time to time. Last year, former Go-Go's guitarist Charlotte Caffey and Anna Waronker, daughter of label guru Lenny Waronker and ex-frontwoman of That Dog, started up a record label dubbed Five Foot Two Records. So now, after releasing a solo album this summer, Anna's done the rock world a great service by reissuing Redd Kross' long out-of-print 1987 classic, Neurotica-- and, what with Anna and Charlotte being married to the brothers Steve and Jeff McDonald, the core members of Redd Kross, the reissue shines with the light of careful consideration. The album was recorded with producer Tommy Ramone (listed in the liner notes under his birthname, Tommy Erdelyi), but when their label Big Time folded soon after, the record's promotion suffered, leaving it relatively unheard by the masses, and to later become cult classic. As with most overlooked records, its power was channeled through other artists; these days, Neurotica is regarded as a prime influence on the early 90s grunge movement: Sub Pop once contracted the Posies' Jon Auer to remix the album for a re-release during the Seattle boom, but the project was not meant to be. Neurotica exuded a Janus quality found in the best pop music: it looked forward and equally embraced the past. It was the missing link between Big Star and the Pixies, a perfect blend of a 70s Saturday morning sugar rush and 80s California punk. Pop culture nostalgia was to Redd Kross what LSD was to the Butthole Surfers; their music was delivered with just as furious a passion, but their love for Beatles-esque pop harmony shone through as much as any punk sensibility, and their Kinks influences, entirely free of irony, served as lyrical substance over their powerful, hi-octane hooks. Leading with its title track, lifted from the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)"" and complete with Liverpudlian count-off; Neurotica is definitive Redd Kross, coupling undulating melody and a sweetly harmonized bridge (remember bridges?) with a screaming chorus, and the result is as abrasive as it is catchy. ""Love Is You"", the album's sole acoustic number, is as much a tribute to a girl as to love songs themselves; its tongue-in-cheek falsetto delivery sounds alternately comic and passionate. ""Peach Kelli Pop"", a Beatles-via-Badfinger rave-up, boasts the best swaggering vocals this side of Paul Westerberg, its lyrics illustrating just how far from the then ever-present Sunset Strip ethos Redd Kross were: ""Everybody take a ride/ In your mama's car/ Let's go to the Troubadour/ Pretend we're seein' stars/ Man, we're cruisin' Hollywood/ Do you get the joke?/ Laughin' at all the assholes at the Rainbow/ Flyin' so high on coke/ What a joke."" There's an innate sense of joy at the heart of Neurotica. At times, the hardcore riffing teeters a bit too close to Hollywood hair metal, but when it's balanced by such undeniably fucking brilliant pop hooks and choruses, who's complaining? The McDonald brothers' sense of melody and song structure is solely responsible for the album's charm, and in this world of haircuts and target marketing, it's good to be reminded that, no matter the era, every metropolitan underground produces phenomenal records-- even 1987 L.A.","One of the most exciting things about being addicted to music is the joy of discovery.

Reclinerland,Reclinerland,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a221ea9e61561daa497d/1:1/w_160/10224cb1.gif,2002-01-09 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6705-reclinerland/,Hush,"There are albums you love and there are albums you hate. Somewhere between east and west are the albums that neither pleasure your eardrums nor puncture them. At best, these albums are ordinary. At worst, they're obnoxious. Unfailingly, these records add little to the great panoply of the grand experience we call music. And in a world where 35,000 albums are released each year, they not only occupy vital shelf space, but their mere existence exacerbates the already challenging task of discovering true brilliance. They are anathema to our noble cause. And as a result, we ought to attack them like coked-up mongooses. Today, comrades, I am your mongoose, and Reclinerland is my field mouse. From track one, vocalist and songwriter Mike Johnson is front-and-center. His songwriting style, not surprisingly, won't shatter your notion of consonance; the first track, ""Miss Haze,"" features Johnson and his acoustic guitar strumming lazily through a groundbreaking G-C progression. The progression doesn't change. By the end, Johnson is still strumming a measure of G. Then a measure of C. Then a measure of G. Then a measure of C. You get the idea. Many arrangements on Reclinerland approximate the two-chord progression of ""Miss Haze,"" with Johnson self-consciously moaning in the foreground. Commonplace arrangements would be fine if Reclinerland was a melody-focused effort; but as far as I can tell, it's not. And if it is, someone needs to adjust the sharpness. ""Pound Coins"" shows off another of Johnson's weaker points-- a smidge of tone-deafness. When he gets courageous and tries singing some high notes (the chorus, ""I walked along/ Mispronouncing all the funny names""), he's clearly just a bit flat. Some call it cute and endearing; I call it annoying. ""Pound Coins"" isn't the only manifestation of the disability, either. It shows up, regrettably, on more than a few tracks (""19th Century Boy"" and ""Dirty and Clean,"" for example). My campaign against mediocrity notwithstanding, can I say nice things about Reclinerland? Sure, I can (sidenote: I can also say nice things about Lifehouse). In and of itself, and in the hands of an unbiased listener (read: not me), this stuff ain't bad. The lyrics are often poetic and appealingly witty, like this lyric from ""Eight"": ""I must have walked around in circles for a matter of days/ I think I've broken the record for just standing in one place/ I think I've lost all the feeling in the right side of my brain/ It's hard to explain."" Unfortunately, they can also be as trite as the chord progressions, like the Jimmy V-inspired ""I want you so badly/ Don't give up, don't give up,"" from ""Meet Me Later in the File Room."" In addition to strong lyrics, a few of the songs pull it all together, like ""Vegas Remains,"" which fingerpicks instead of strumming a chord progression and adds some sentimental schmaltz about how Johnson ""knows we're really just eight pages,"" whatever that means. Finally, the man strikes a consistent mood-- sweet and thoughtful-- that I'm certain resonates with at least a few of the under-25 crowd. There are good reasons I don't drive a Chevy Caprice Classic, eat Wonder Bread, live in Iowa, or root for Vinny Testaverde. For roughly the same reasons, you won't find me lavishing in the mellow hues of Reclinerland. A pleasant listen, but pleasant is about as far as I'm willing to go with this one.","There are albums you love and there are albums you hate. Somewhere between east and west are the albums that ...

Dynasty,Grace Period,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18dea9e61561daa4825/1:1/w_160/78644a10.jpg,2002-01-08 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3537-dynasty/,Audio Dregs,"The first Aphex Twin track I ever loved was ""Flim,"" from the Come to Daddy EP. There's not much to it-- some one-handed piano, a single synthesizer swell, and programmed drums. The spare beauty of the piano melody is certainly to be admired (it's one of many Aphex tracks inspired by Satie), but the real kicker for me has always been the beats. ""Flim"" looms large in my personal listening history because it's the first track I remember hearing where the percussion carries the bulk of the emotional content. Its drums are loaded with tension, constantly feeling as though they might be moving just a bit too fast for the tune, in danger of falling over themselves. But they never lose their footing and continue to drop into place with precision, providing serious catharsis at the end of every 16th bar. I've come across music where the feelings hinge on the percussion since I first discovered ""Flim,"" but I've not heard a band pursue the notion as relentlessly over the course of an album as Boston's the Grace Period. Dynasty is an album of subtle touches and rare warmth, filled with interesting melodic fragments and memorable sounds. But the drums are what make these songs special. Just as Alan Sutherland of Land of the Loops used live bass to provide both the foundation and sonic signature for his work, Grace Period main-man (and former Pitchfork writer) Chris Ott's drums are the heart and soul of this record. ""Paris Au Printemps"" begins the album with a sexy bit of French dialog, and then one spoken line is plucked and set into looping motion. The drumming on the track is loose and relaxed, like it's guiding the listener slowly into a dream, a feeling enhanced by the velvety synthesizer chords. Thick, round keyboard drones are a recurring theme throughout Dynasty, serving as a blurry pastel background for the brush strokes of the percussion. ""Best of Boston"" begins with some of the warmest such drones on the record, which are in contrast to the crisp cymbal hits that set the track in motion. ""My Girlfriend"" is one of the few songs to plainly incorporate an outside sample, looping a section of a wordless three-note falsetto vocal and burying it beneath determined drumming and a looped acoustic guitar pattern, all to sublime effect. The militaristic rudiments that make up the rhythm of ""Et in Arcadia Ego"" compliment the coldest synths on Dynasty, providing some interesting contrast to the generally congenial tone. Occasionally, the Grace Period's experiments with drum texture don't quite hit, as on the bombastic Bonham-isms that encompass the annoying ""Boring Arial Layout."" But these occasional misfires aren't what keep me from loving this album. Dynasty comes up a bit short for me in its over-reliance on the looped fragment as a basis for composition. These songs are evocative, well-crafted and emotional, but some of them are also too repetitive, a quality with potential to limit repeat playability in the distant future. For the time being, though, I am digging this record. It's fair to lump the Grace Period with sample-driven outfits on labels like Slabco or My Pal God, but the similarity is primarily in the mode of production. There's nothing even remotely kitschy about Dynasty. You never get the feeling that somebody spent 500 hours in front of the television, flipping channels with one hand with a finger on the VCR's record button. The Grace Period is softer, more reflective, and ultimately more human; what voice samples there are might be recordings of friends who happened to be hanging around. Instead of a pop culture travelogue, the Grace Period feels more like a diary-- one open-ended enough to apply to anybody.","The first Aphex Twin track I ever loved was ""Flim,"" from the Come to Daddy EP.

The members of this party interact and exchange various phenomena without a shred of cautious foresight, and what results is more fruitful and volatile and reactive than any one elements could ever have been alone. I imagine the streets in Koenji must be crawling with taste police on the lookout for illegal cross-pollination and concept-ridden, incestuous marriages; that the kids who are voluntarily dropping out of the material world for riskier exhibitions must live in constant paranoia that their night lives will be used against them when the number-crunching begins. Or worse-- that nobody will listen when it's their turn to play. But unbeknownst to their more conservative brethren, who would settle for the Occidental Tourism of Western Pop as scripture, these kids, cousins and artful clergymen are making something new under the Empire of the Sun. This is not manufactured, and it's certainly not criminal, but it is, in fact, quite extraordinary. These wildly informed noise shamans, in the age of supposed information sharing, have beaten American democratic spirit at its own game. I'm talking about unselfish art and the exchange of ideas. I'm talking about today's Japanese independent music. Okay, so maybe I romanticize this stuff a bit. But it's not for any love of melodrama, as I can assure that I enjoy reading about someone's obscure fetishes about as much as you do. No, the musicians working underground back east pique my interest mostly due to renegade originality and purity of expression in the face of drastic underexposure. For example, when I heard the story of drummer Tatsuya Yoshida's first rehearsal with his then un-named band, wherein the guitarist didn't show up and he decided to go with only himself and a bassist for the subsequent 15 years as Ruins, I took notice. Or, when I read about how, after more than a decade of praise from the alternative press, Boredoms frontman Yamatsuka Eye still doesn't think his band plays well enough, doesn't understand why people call his music ""noise,"" and is constantly striving for the next new sound, I was struck. These are stories of people who refuse to accept the mundane, practical or given. It's easy to romanticize a scene that offers no guarantees of fame, and yet whose members are as in love with their art as any detached fanatic. Japanese Independent Music is an ambitious undertaking by the French label Sonore. Although there have been samplers of experimental Japanese music before, it's never been easy for Western audiences to find information about the music. Sonore head Franck Stofer packaged this album with a book of the same title that's a virtual godsend to anyone who was ever frustrated trying to find out about a band like Ruins. The book is an encyclopedic reference, with an extensive, alphabetical listing of hundreds of fringe Japanese bands/artists, featuring full discographies, essays on various sub-scenes, and even an appendix with label addresses and contact info. And best of all, it's in English, unlike the first French-only edition. I'll let you find it on your own-- and you will, if this is your bag-- but for now, let's talk about the most important stuff: the music. The CD features tracks from 18 of the most important contributors to Japan's independent music scene. It covers a lot of ground, conceptually speaking: modern-classical, avant-prog, IDM, neo-trad Japanese folk, noise, punk-- basically, anything John Zorn has been preaching since he started his inter-continental commute in the 80s. It's a much more varied collection than others such as Bad Sun Rising or Tokyo Flashback, and perhaps most comparable to the excellent double-disc Virgin UK release Cosmic Kurushi Monsters: Tokyo Invasion Vol. 1 from 1996. This stuff goes out on a limb, and be forewarned that a little artistic levity is required before entering. Standout tracks for me include Gaji's ""Trippin' Under a Changin' Sphere"" and Hoppy Kamiyama's ""Fantasm B."" Gaji is an experimental punk band from Tokyo who actually started out as kind of an eclectic mix of Wire, krautrock and Boredoms, but here sound much more focused and traditionally wound. The band's female vocalist, Hasegawa Yuko, reminds me of a less girly Patty Donahue, but the band's sound here is full-on aggressive, totally assured poly-punk-- think Minutemen crossed with 80s King Crimson. Too many reference points? How about moving on to Kamiyama, and about a dozen more? Hoppy Kamiyama's tune is a great representation of many of his favorite musical outlets: Bartok-influenced chamber classical, horror soundtracks, Rock in Opposition, and no wave. The guy has seemingly been around forever, and covers a lot of bases in his 4\xBD minutes on this CD. If you never have the fortune of hearing some of his work, you'll probably run into him indirectly when investigating the scene anyway because he's head of the excellent God Mountain label (Pugs, Koenji-Hyakkei, Optical*8, Demi Semi Quaver), as well as producer for dozens of acts elsewhere. He's also worked with Zorn and Maceo Parker in the West, so I wouldn't try to hide from him. Electronic music gets its props here, too, as tracks by Wono Satoru, Yuko Nexus6, Furudate Tetsuo and Nakamura Toshimaru demonstrate that not all of the best new computer-generated madness is coming out of Chicago or Germany. Nakamura's track is straight sine-wavey stuff, produced entirely from a mixing board with no inputs. Satoru's ""Allego"" was done using only a phonograph plexus, while Yuko Nexus6's minimalist ""N.S.K.K."" sounds as if created more from the muse of a computer scientist than an experimental turntable magician. Lest these descriptions sound a bit technical, Furudate's piece brings in a little royal courtyard sturm-und-drang to spice up its strains of pounding sheet metal and reverberated signal beacons. I suppose some of this stuff would work well in a Mad Max movie, but I'm just using it to get pumped about going back to work tomorrow. There are some ""big"" names here as well, like Ruins, Keiji Haino and Acid Mothers Temple, but I don't want to bore you with the music the good Fork has been (possibly over-)hyping these last few months. Or, it could be that I just don't want to go on like a crazed fan, forcing this stuff down your throat. Instead, here's something I read from an interview with avant-hero Oshima Dan: ""I think that Japanese indie music is based on absolutely absurd spirit. I mean, it's built on nothing, it contains no culture."" On the one hand, I think Dan undersells the impact this music has on its audience, because I can tell you first-hand that whatever the music is built on is certainly weightier than most anything else I've heard. However, he has a point; this is music that is not of a culture, but rather appears to be creating one. Whatever scenes you subscribe to, ask yourself how many of them could remain as vital when even the chance to hear the music was an obstacle. How many could overcome little-to-no documentation or familiarity with the principal actors involved? Right now, I can only think of one, and if you blink, you could miss it.","It's an orgy-- something that may not have been designed for mass consumption,\n\ but is nevertheless creating and ...

The First Conspiracy,The (International) Noise Conspiracy,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9769d034d5c69bf521f/1:1/w_160/fd49e2c2.gif,2002-01-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4111-the-first-conspiracy/,G7 Welcoming Committee,"At some point, we all idolize celebrities. That's the nature of our icon-driven culture. And for all the media glut, legitimate heroes-- the kind who do something more than sing, act or kick footballs-- are kind of hard to come by. I fell victim to such pop idolatry. After letting go of the Madonna fascination around late sixth grade, I moved onto other idols, eventually settling on a couple of Kims (Deal and Gordon, to be exact) in high school. So I can sympathize with (International) Noise Conspiracy frontman Dennis Lyxzen, who wears his celebrity crush on his sleeve. It's kind of endearing, really. I mean, out of all the celebrities and quasi-celebrities in rock and roll today, he picked the ex-Nation of Ulysses/ex-Make-Up singer Ian Svenonius. Of course, there's a fine line between idolatry and obsession, and I'm guessing the only thing stopping Lyxzen from going through the garbage outside the Svenonius household is geography. Sweden is quite a ways from D.C., and due to the corporate nature of air travel, I'm sure Lyxzen's anti-capitalist politics would hinder a jetsetting lifestyle. Of course, the (International) Noise Conspiracy's ""Capitalism Stole My Virginity"" appears with some regularity on M2, so what the hell do I know? Unable to follow up on his obsession in first person, present tense, Lyxzen seems to have arrived at the conclusion that his only choice is to Become Ian Svenonius, a goal easily enough achieved with the right combination of hair products and like-minded cohorts. First, he would form a loud, angry band (Refused) that would release records with retro cover art and lengthy manifestoes as liner notes, and mediate the obvious similarity to Nation of Ulysses by throwing in some heavy metal and electronica for kicks. That band would release two albums, and be followed up with another band, which would trade in the screaming and noise for danceable, soul-infused garage rock tunes. The new band would require members to wear tight, flared trousers, cultivate a highly stylized look and sound, and get a pretty girl (who had previously played in a feisty all-female band) with a complicated retro hairdo to join the team. And there you have it: the Make-Up. Erm, I mean, the (International) Noise Conspiracy. The sound of these two bands is so totally similar, I double-dare you to listen to the title track on The First Conspiracy, the Noise Conspiracy's recently released compendium of early EPs, and see if you can't imagine an obscure Make-Up tribute band covering a rejected track from Destination Love. It's all there: Lars Stromberg playing pseudo-James Canty with spare, throwback guitar hooks; the simple, yet funky rhythm section; and of course, Lyxzen's occasionally squealing delivery. Simply put, that's the formula, and you'll find little variance on any of The First Conspiracy's twelve tracks, save an occasional chanted sing-along (""T.I.M.E.B.O.M.B."") or a foray into slightly punker territory (""Black Mask""). In fact, the only factors saving this disc from being a total rehash of all your favorite Make-Up moments are the following: 1) for better or worse, James Brown vocalizing doesn't translate so well to Swedish; 2) there's a keyboard; and 3) the lyrics. Indeed. If you like your music heavy on the anarcho-communist polemic, then certainly this is the band for you. For example, in ""The Sin Crusade,"" Lyxzen squeals, ""Noise, in this case, the idea of the subversive sounds that could, in difference with the regular pop group, serve as an attack against music's function as the spectacle, the only way we can even begin to play the revolutionary game."" That's a song lyric, folks. Lyxzen gets technical in ""I Swear If U Do"" (which even looks like a Make-Up title) by including footnoted dates and a quotation from Engels' Within the Body of the Song. Truly, The First Conspiracy's lyric sheet would function beautifully as a sly parody of political rock music. Problem is, they're dead serious-- in flared pants-- and the only thing I can figure is that the sense of humor of the Noise Conspiracy's D.C. idols was lost in translation. Also, to say this political earnestness is something of a killjoy would be a massive understatement. In the end, you find yourself giggling at the lyrics and wondering if such imitation isn't, well, kind of sad.","At some point, we all idolize celebrities.

World of Gold,The Nerves,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3cd5e6ef959693238f1/1:1/w_160/e5e5bb64.jpg,2002-01-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5750-world-of-gold/,Thrill Jockey,"Man, look at those guys. Obviously not to be fucked with. That one guy in the middle looks like the leader. He's just sitting there, smoking a cigarette, paying no attention to the fact that the two gentlemen standing to either side of him are about to kick someone's ass. There's a bear head on the wall. The guy with the plaid shirt and the big belt probably wrestled it to the ground with his own two hands, and slowly removed its head with a Swiss Army knife while the guy with his hands over his crotch cheered him on. These are the kind of guys who, if they saw you in a dark alley, would be too busy not giving a fuck about you to kick your ass. Looking at the cover of World of Gold, it's fun to imagine that the boys of Nerves are true rustic badasses. Unfortunately, only one syllable in the phrase ""true rustic badasses"" really rings true about this CD. World of Gold is an utterly unspectacular, plodding, and flat-out boring attempt at rough rock swagger. Though there are a few glimpses of inspiringly competent songwriting, this is an album that, at its very, very best, brings to mind phrases like ""inspiringly competent."" World of Gold opens with the infuriatingly uneven ""10 Feet Tall."" Starting with a riff that's about as fresh as Weezer's ""Hash Pipe,"" vocalist Rob Datum pulls out his best semi-retarded Iggy Pop affectations. It's certainly not awful, but it doesn't exactly grab your attention, either. After a while, some well-placed slide guitar hints at greater things, but that hint is never taken, and the song immediately slides back into its stale riffage. And later, another shift towards more interesting songwriting is interrupted by a solo that sounds like it could have been played by a 12-year-old guitar student who's still discovering the wonders of the pentatonic scale. ""Suffering Highway"" and ""Behind the Trees"" are similarly boring-- the former being absolutely unmemorable, and the latter being rather annoying. Sloppy playing is fine, but sloppy slide guitar can lead to an unwanted foray into microtonal music. ""Behind the Trees"" closes with an absolutely unnecessary instrumental passage complete with vibraphones-- something that may or may not have been specified in their contract when they signed with Thrill Jockey. Tacking on vibraphones to clumsy, endlessly repetitive garage rock does nothing but emphasize the complete lack of original ideas that plagues this album. I'll give them this much: occasionally, on a track like ""Take It,"" Nerves manage to pull off some sufficiently convincing sloppy rock. Most of the time, though, when World of Gold does manage to grab your attention (which is rare), it isn't in a positive way. Other bands, like Clinic and the White Stripes, have managed to successfully adopt a similar aesthetic by bringing their own innovation and/or energy to the mix. But without the benefit of either of these, World of Gold is about as convincing as pyrite, and ten times as dull.","Man, look at those guys. Obviously not to be fucked with.

Creating Patterns,4 Hero,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be07eb335119a49ecfd7/1:1/w_160/63710d5d.gif,2002-01-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3164-creating-patterns/,Polygram,"It's been over three years since 4 Hero released their last album, Two Pages, which has given them enough time to hob-knob about the industry and pool together enough guest musicians for their latest effort, Creating Patterns, a kind of ""Chicken Soup for the Soul for Those That Gotta Get Their Minds Together."" Apparently feeling pent-in by their simple designation as drum-n-bass luminaries, Dego and Marc Mac have decided to spread their ambitions far and wide, creating an album that harkens back to Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life and Herbie Hancock's Head Hunters. 4 Hero are obviously wizards in the studio; the production values and sounds they create are sterling. However, the topical concerns of Creating Patterns bring to mind an incredible array of -ism's-- eastern mysticism, religious syncretism and socially progressive, get-yer-ass-off-the-couch pragmatism, to name a few-- that come close to derailing the musical content. With nearly 30 years separating us from Songs in the Key of Life, the conceits contained there simply sound naïve; here, they border more on the self-indulgent. My interest in Creating Patterns was largely piqued by the UK hype surrounding its release and its designation in more than one place as album-of-the-year. I was prepared to follow suit 30 seconds into the first track, ""Conceptions,"" when I was taken aback by the gorgeous mix of layered strings, sitar, and soprano sax over a loping bassline that wafted from the speakers like a shower of perfumed lotus petals. I eased back in my chair and let myself float away, prepared never to come back, except possibly as a Bodhisattva gushing praise for my new favorite album. But what followed was a let-down. Aside from ""Conceptions,"" there's really only one other track on the album that took me hook, line and sinker: ""Les Fleur."" And even this song lost most of its luster when it revealed itself as a nearly note-for-note replica of Minnie Riperton's gorgeous song of the same name. My experience with Creating Patterns was consistently disrupted by lyrical contributions I found hard to swallow. ""Time"" features the ubiquitous Ursula Rucker spoiling a perfectly good arrangement with her open-mic-night voyage of spiritual conflict, which is only enlightening insofar as it displays how much more convenient it is for a poet to ransack the Old Testament than to try to say something original. Mark Murphy's performance on ""Twelve Tribes"" is far more convincing and I loved his delivery. But it also includes lines like, ""Twelve, the infinite number/ All of us are twelve once and then never the same/ Twelve opens the eyes and the mind/ We learn more between the ages of twelve and eighteen than we ever again experience in learning/ The Mayan calendar ends in 2012/ What, then?/ Hmm? Hmm?"" I assume we're supposed to find this incredibly mind-blowing. Maybe after smoking a few bowls. (""2012! Dude, what a bummer! We'd better have this all smoked by then-- we don't want it to go to waste."") If you can ignore the silliness, though, it's a great track that rivals Medeski, Martin and Wood's ""Whatever Happened to Gus?"" ""Another Day"" features Jill Scott, and it's kind of odd hearing a woman that sounds like Anita Baker sing about how, although she'd rather stay home and play video games than go to work, by god, she's going to push forward and make something of herself. ""Unique"" turns things around with Brazilian-tinged instrumentation and Portuguese vocals, and ""The Day of the Greys,"" an epic, folk-inflected number, keeps the record riding at a passable level. ""Hold It Down"" might even appeal to fans of Lauryn Hill and straight ahead R&B.; But then there are the numerous unpleasant excursions into jazz fusion like ""Twothesme,"" ""Golden Solitude,"" and ""Eight,"" which grind away repetitively to the point of a mind-numbing, next-song-please anxiety. Creating Patterns left me disappointed, and feeling that the album could have amounted to much more. A shame, because 4 Hero are creating some of the most startling studio sounds I've come across. The string arrangements that back the tracks here remind me of the golden age of 70s soul, smooth and well-crafted. The beats are crisp and catchy, and the scope of the album is ambitious, even though, in the end, that ambition proves to be its biggest weakness. I'll be looking forward to their next effort, hoping they decide to trust their own talents and go it alone.","It's been over three years since 4 Hero released their last album, Two Pages,\n\ which has given them ...

Give the People What We Want: Songs of the Kinks,Various Artists,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb4abf31b7dc7155b55/1:1/w_160/f4fafd99.jpg,2002-01-07 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4456-give-the-people-what-we-want-songs-of-the-kinks/,Sub Pop,"As I type this, numb-fingered from the desk-side window draught in my inefficient, overpriced, yet aesthetically pleasing apartment, I must fess up to my undeniable attraction to the charming, unnecessary, and impractical. I'm a form over function kinda girl all the way around. So what's a subzero temperature and frequently compromised plumbing in an apartment where the moldings and doorframes are really cool, right? Well, in terms of being aesthetically pleasing, the charm factor on Sub Pop's new Kinks tribute album, Give the People What We Want, hits just slightly higher than a Sub Pop promotional compilation. Kinks covers have lost a lot of their appeal since people started covering ""Come Dancing"" like it was going out of style. (Don't do it. For the love of God, if you're in a band, don't. I cannot stress this enough.) What's great about this tribute, though, is that it effectively merges all of the above into a somewhat uninspired, though truly weird amalgamation that eviscerates the competition by providing you with what you never even thought about wanting. For instance: a quiet, heartfelt rendition of ""Waterloo Sunset,"" as performed by the Fastbacks. It's the most charmlessly charming, utterly superfluous album I've heard in a while. And to get right to the point: if you consistently answer the question ""do you really need that?"" with a resounding ""yes,"" consider this compilation a possibility. If not, you should probably skip the rest of this review and pay your phone bill. Now that I've isolated the spendthrifts, please understand that I'm not making an argument for this record's kitsch value. That would be something different-- something less premeditated, and probably less bizarre. But where most tribute albums suffer from a hyper-obsession with remaining true to the original artist, this compilation makes a strong case for the offbeat. Some portion of this could be attributable to the featured artists (I mean, when you think Murder City Devils, the Kinks aren't exactly next in line for free association). But this is a good thing. I'm all for the eclectic. Still, that well over half of the artists on this album have at least semi-formal connections to Sub Pop makes the record resemble someone's creative idea for a promotional sampler-- ""Hey, people really like the Kinks. This might, in a roundabout way, sell more Murder City Devils records."" On paper, it looks like a good idea. One can imagine a Post-It on a desk in a certain Seattle office reading: ""Don't forget the punk rock cover of 'Come Dancing.' The kids love those."" However, under careful scrutiny, the notion sort of deconstructs itself. Sure, the Kinks are great, but that doesn't change the fact that the Murder City Devils' take on ""Alcohol"" (done up in the old Killdozer style) is mostly unappetizing. Both Mudhoney and Love as Laughter contribute tracks; both sound like an afterthought. With Mudhoney, one expects a certain amount of laziness, but Love as Laughter's ""Tin Soldier Man,"" recorded by only half of the band, is a real disappointment after the great Sea to Shining Sea. In fact, some of the better moments on Give the People What We Want are either foregone conclusions or way out in left field. For example, garage-rockers the Fallouts offer a perfectly credible version of ""The Man He Weeps Tonight."" Conversely, the Makers' compelling ""Strangers"" comes off a bit like the bastard child of Neil Diamond and Iggy Pop (uh, it's really much, much better than that sounds). Elsewhere, the Posies' Jon Auer and singer/songwriter Heather Duby contribute mellow, adult-alternative covers of ""Fancy"" and ""The Way Love Used to Be."" And Nikol Kollars' R&B; rendition of ""I Go to Sleep"" is remarkable only for her uncanny-- and I do mean uncanny-- vocal similarity to Fiona Apple. To say that Give the People What We Want is predominated by filler wouldn't be completely fair. Some of the filler isn't bad; just predictable (the Young Fresh Fellows, the Congratulators). And of course, the artists shied away from the obvious (no one covers ""Lola"") without completely avoiding the predictable pratfalls (the punk rock version of ""Come Dancing,"" by a band called the Briefs who tragically didn't get my memo on not doing that). Hmmm... so, hey, are you sure you really need that? Your call.","As I type this, numb-fingered from the desk-side window draught in my inefficient, overpriced, yet aesthetically pleasing apartment, I must ...

The proof speaks for itself: Winger, Nelson, Bonham, Dokken, Danzig, and Dio, to name only a few. For over 20 years, I counted on my last name, Haywood, as my ticket to celebrity. That is, until a group of bastards from Brooklyn decided to lift my birthright, the righteous moniker of my forthcoming avant-metal band, Haywood. My band would have featured me, Brad Haywood, on vocals and autoharp, along with my sister Kelly on bass flute, and my dad chopping wood. I was also toying with a way to work some midgets into the equation, with my mother as coordinator. Awesome! But alas, t'was not to be. I've known it since 2000, when my friend Bradly (with no ""e""-- how weird is that? My friend is a fucking adverb) picked up a copy of Haywood's second LP, Men Called Him Mister, from a D.C.-area bargain bin. I listened, expecting little, but the more I heard, the more I knew my dream was not only in hot water; it was plainly a bad idea. It was best to leave the Haywood legacy to men who, although not Haywoods by birth, were Haywoods at heart. Or at least had talent. Unfortunately for the world, the Haywood legacy consists of only three LPs. The latest of those, We Are Amateurs, You and I, was released in late 2001 after the band split to pursue other projects. It's an excellent work of catchy indie-pop, reminiscent of Built to Spill, with a profoundly personal and sentimental side. ""Button Up Buttercup"" is so good it almost burns itself onto your next CD mix. The tune employs three or four hyper-melodic guitar hooks, the best of which oscillates with a stiff drumbeat to lead stunningly into the chorus. It would find itself subject to the rarely used ""repeat"" function on your disc player if it weren't for its follow-up, ""Six Stars,"" a simple, sentimental love crush (""I adore just/ Your gorgeous eyes"") delivered with passionate, blurry-eyed authenticity. Competing with ""Button Up Buttercup"" for top-honors on the disc is ""Don't Go Breaking (My Heart),"" which takes a heartfelt turn with group-sung vocals. These are contrasted with percussive instrumental bridges, the last slowing to a near-complete halt before firing back into a final power-chorus and instrumental section. In less capable hands, it might be boring, but Haywood's musicianship and maturity make it a powerful thing. We Are Amateurs, You and I boasts the talent and focus of a band that's played together for nine years. The final document sounds like both a personal diary and a thank-you note, a last shot from a band in their prime. They have done my family name proud. Memories of the elementary school perils of my surname prompt me to ask one final question: ""Hey, would you guys come back?""","My badass hypothesis-- one I've staked much of my musical career on-- is that last-name band-naming is the secret ...

Sappy longing for what once was, and pathetic cries in the face of temporality to reverse its unending drive forward all end up a complete waste. Wasn't it the great Oprah Winfrey that assisted millions of bourgeois housewives all over America to stop living in the past? Perhaps we should transfer such pop-psychology to our own indie living. But I just can't get past the fact that this Cherubino record's gotten me all nostalgic. The Self-Starter foundation prides itself in releasing the debut albums by Karate and Les Savy Fav, and now bringing us the debut seven-song EP from NYC-based emo trio Cherubino. That's right, the emo never dies. Just like the past, I would say. You see, Cherubino's raw rock elements and lighthearted melodies have me all distraught over the death of Pavement and that zany Malkmus, the times when Weezer weren't so damn terrible, and the fact that the electrified wails of the White Stripes aren't in my stereo at the moment. Of course, I could always change the disc and relive those Pinkerton years in a second, but it's just not the same. And it's not that Cherubino sounds anything like any of the aforementioned bands-- only that certain elements spark that sort of nostalgia in me. The quasi-lo-fi rock isn't totally lo-fi a la early Pavement, though the vague, Malkmus-inflected lyrics do aspire to that level of brilliance (without quite making it). The guitar solo of ""Mercury Retrograde"" screams Blue Album Weezer with its simplistic melodic sensibility soaked in overdrive. Lines like, ""We could build a house just for two,"" from the same track, and the vocal turns in ""Rocket,"" are delivered with an almost passionate disregard by frontman Travis Peterson that sounds like a subdued Jack White. Drummer Karen Tercho even chimes in for a vocal cameo on the latter in addition to her bangin' beats. But one must understand the divergence between these modern legends and Cherubino. For one, the lyrics are concerned with little other than failing relationships. ""It's gonna take more than a kiss to make up for this,"" sings Peterson over the heavy shuffle of the opening track, ""Kiss."" The lyric is intoned with a playfulness that transcends the line's superficial banality, primarily because of its implications. And just like it takes some talent to even draw comparison to those greats, Cherubino rises above the general fodder of their contemporaries to create something that hints at potential. Hints of synth peek through the mix on a few tracks, and like the brilliant breaking of the film strip incorporated into Ingmar Bergman's Persona, the sound disintegrates in the middle of ""Car Wreck."" Their live performances are known for their inebriated energy, but like former Foundationeers Les Savy Fav, the sheer romp of this energy is lost in the studio. What bothers me most is that even Bird's twenty-five minutes feel a bit indulgent. Unlike Les Savy Fav, Cherubino has yet to stretch their genre's stodgy boundaries. Of course, this is only their first release, so we can hope for the best in their future, but for now I'm going to go curl up in the corner with my Wowee Zowee.","Nostalgia's a bummer.

David Axelrod,David Axelrod,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a163b1335d7bf169824a/1:1/w_160/c79fd95f.jpg,2002-01-06 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/391-david-axelrod/,Mo'Wax,"David Axelrod is an odd character in popular music. There's really no bin to file him in, though he's had his paws in just about everything that's happened in popular music since his career began way back in the 1950s. In certain respects, he fits rather nicely next to other idiosyncratic figures of his heyday-- guys like Van Dyke Parks and Lee Hazlewood who kept up appearances by writing pop songs and producing other peoples' albums, all the while compiling their own personal back catalogs of bizarre, often unclassifiable music. However, his music sits in a different realm, more removed from traditional concepts of songwriting and instrumentation, and vastly more indebted to jazz. This makes sense, as Axelrod served as producer to such notables as Cannonball Adderley and Stan Kenton. He's also responsible for much of Lou Rawls' mid-60s output, and the architect of the Electric Prunes' ultra-strange psychedelic Mass in F# Minor. If you own anything by DJ Shadow, Kid Koala, or any number of other modern turntable collagists, chances are you've heard at least a few snippets of Axelrod's own solo work. He even has a remixing credit himself on U.N.K.L.E.'s ""Rabbit in Your Headlights"" single. His twelfth solo effort is a strange concoction of old and new that begs the listener to question when exactly it was recorded. This is partly because it was actually recorded in two completely different eras. The majority of the basic rhythm tracks for seven of the nine songs included here were recorded thirty years ago for an aborted project for Warner Brothers. Axelrod had actually completed the charts decades ago, but it wasn't until Mo'Wax became interested in the project at the close of the last century that any initiative was undertaken to finish the recordings. The thirty-year-old acetates blend surprisingly well with the new sessions-- so well, in fact, that it's basically impossible to tell what's new and what's old. The things we know are new are the first and last tracks-- the album's only vocal songs. David Axelrod opens with cold, quivering strings strangely juxtaposed with James Hughart's fretless bass leads. What this gives way to, however, is much stranger. Saxophones and bassoon creep into the mix, providing a strange, menacing undertow that sounds nearly medieval in character. Deepening the mood is a choir that sounds more like a group of untrained people singing in a church than a tight professional ensemble. The choir exits for the entrance of West Coast rapper Ras Kass, who plows through some impressive verses of beatless orchestral hip-hop before Lanny Morgan's jazzy alto sax solo seizes the spotlight. Kass returns stronger than ever in Morgan's wake, though, spouting lines like, ""And your judges will all have work/ And your lawyers will flap their tongues/ And all your jail guards and cops/ Will be the fathers to your young."" He laughingly tosses off the final line, ""Auction off your future."" This startling beginning is a pretty good indicator of what the rest of the record sounds like over the course of its too-brief 35 minute span. ""Jimmy T"" begins with Howard Roberts' freakish guitar lead before slipping into some sort of quasi-soul groove provided by L.A. studio legends Carol Kaye (bass), Lou Morell (guitar) and Earl Palmer (drums). Bob Efford offers an impressive baritone sax solo, and if you were curious, Joe Sample's the guy at the organ. Dissonant strings cut like shards through the bottom of the mix, and the overall result is unlike anything I've ever heard. ""Crystal Ball"" follows with a somewhat more identifiable Phil Spector vibe, but that doesn't fully explain what it sounds like. Strings flutter in the wings, horns blare in from every direction, the guitars sound like they wandered away from a James Brown album, and the bass almost sounds lifted from Pet Sounds. This leaves us with the singularly pretty ""Fantasy for Ralph."" Ernie Watt's soprano sax solo is so unaffected and unpretentious that it ends up conveying a beauty very much unlike what we conventionally think of as ""pretty"" in modern music. The flutes and other window dressing that introduce the track somehow manage to transcend the schmaltzy connotation that such an arrangement would usually have, and the overall effect is far more current sounding than it probably should be. ""The Dr. and the Diamond"" and ""Big B Plus"" continue down this same richly textured and wildly eccentric path, with the latter sounding something like a cross between a parade, a string quartet and a hive of bees. Flutes flutter constantly on the edges of the song, giving the proceedings a frenzied, nervous feel as the drums and horns clamor away underneath, only to have the whole affair interrupted by melting cellos and violins. ""For Land's Sake"" travels to a Southern revival for a bit of gospel, albeit gospel polluted by any number of other bastard elements that are awfully difficult to pin down. Then comes the moody ""The Shadow Knows,"" an oddly hip-hopish track (remember, those drums were recorded thirty years ago) laced with traces of Peter Thomas' ""Space Patrol"" scores and endowed with more of Howard Roberts' utterly bizarre guitar leads. David Axelrod closes on a powerful note with ""Loved Boy,"" dedicated to his deceased son Terry. Lou Rawls infuses the simple lyrics with an intense passion that almost makes it sound as though it's his own son that was lost. Oscar Brashear's clarion trumpet lines do their best to hold Rawls together with their conversational tones, but he owns the song, seemingly dragging the arrangement along with him as though it were the very burden of grief. The orchestra sounds broken, chugging along with a sense of duty to the recording, but never slipping into gear. The result is so devastatingly sad and desolate that it's difficult to imagine a weirder or more appropriate homage to a departed loved one. David Axelrod has created an utterly unique recording with his twelfth album-- one that sounds neither dated, nor of its time. Rather, it exists in that world of albums that really have no time-- albums like Scott Walker's Tilt or Joni Mitchell's Mingus. It even comes with unique packaging, strangely wrapped in a cardboard slip case and inner artwork that resembles a little starship. It's hard to say who exactly would like this album, but it's nearly impossible for me not to recommend it. If you have a taste for something new and a desire to hear an album whose effect will likely never be approximated anywhere else, I urge you to give this one a spin.","David Axelrod is an odd character in popular music.

Detect,Dub Taylor,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a741ea9e61561daa5542/1:1/w_160/9da1fe80.jpg,2002-01-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7951-detect/,Force Tracks,"Tech-house dub artist Alex Kruger is getting his share of attention, despite his confusing tendency to record under countless radar-eluding aliases. For his two full-length 2001 excursions, Kruger selected his Dub Taylor mask and attempted to grab some of the glory surrounding minimal maestro, Matthias Schaffhauser. Detect, Kruger-as-Taylor's second full-length in 2001, is more of a compilation than Forms and Figures, the other 2001 album Kruger released for Raum-Musik. Because of the speed at which Kruger creates his tracks, Detect doesn't sound like a fits-and-starts hodgepodge of an assembly. But it doesn't sound like a winner, either. When compared to other similarly inflected artists, the music Taylor rolls out is commonplace and merely functional-- the title track, for example, is merely a serviceable and crunchy rendition of the glitch-dub house that's characterized the Chain Reaction label for the last five years. Yes, Kruger's concession to innovation is restricted to a punchy bassline and slightly click-hop-derived percussion. ""Sweet Lips"" is the first vocal cut on Detect, and like the album's other four sing-songs, it suffers from a want of melody. Vocal house cuts, by my reckoning, should be hummable euphoria. And ""Sweet Lips,"" while vaguely memorable, is hampered by a clumsy lyric about wanting ""your sweet lips on mine."" In a club setting, and after five pints of lager, such things might not bother me. But at home, I get to choose the music and it wouldn't hurt this song's rotation to be a little more interesting. ""Observer"" is a tougher version of the opener and sounds as though a tribally elated Danny Tenaglia or sleazy funked Richard Morel had embraced the white-noise dub of Berlin. ""Newman"" sinks the listener deep beneath an ocean of echoes where Lee Perry trades rhythmic jabs with Moritz von Oswald's Rhythm and Sound project. With vocals by Per Fourier, ""Something Somewhere"" and ""Our Youth"" launch you back to bassbin-serrating tech-house. ""John Wayne"" is not an homage to the Duke that I had expected, unless Wayne was really a k-hole queen who loved to squirm his butt-cheek-exposing leather-chaps into the nether regions of dancers around him. ""I Can't (""...You Know)"" is the closest Kruger has had to a recognizable club tune. He combines his woofer-worrying basslines with delicate Fender Rhodes noodling. Fourier unmemorably joins in with a lyric about not being able to fall in love with anyone but some dark-eyed temptress who's made off with his heart. I'd love to hear a vocal-less version, as Kruger uncuts Fourier's blankly delivered vocals with what sounds like a battling Eric Dolphy bass clarinet. Then, Detect concludes with ""2scale,"" in which Kruger returns to his roots with the kind of echoing dub space that's influenced so much of European techno for years. As such, the record adds little new to the style, but hardly disgraces it either.","Tech-house dub artist Alex Kruger is getting his share of attention, despite his confusing tendency to record under countless radar-eluding ...

Innocence and Despair,Langley Schools Music Project,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca5abf31b7dc7155d8b/1:1/w_160/09967ffc.jpg,2002-01-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4685-innocence-and-despair/,Bar/None,"Most kids go through some kind of music education in school; probably in elementary school, as secondary schools usually don't have the time or resources to force every kid to partake in music each year. What usually happens is that kids will go through some kind of ""general"" music class wherein they learn to sing ""Kumbaya"" in solfege, or organize a performance of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" on recorders and triangles for the PTA meeting. And people wonder why arts programs are increasingly being cut from public school curriculum. There are a number of theorists out there with interesting ideas about how we should be teaching our kids about music. German composer Carl Orff had an interesting idea about education: ""Since the beginning of time, children have not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests at heart, you will let them learn while they play."" Most of you probably had some kind of Music Ed experience-- think about it, and consider if it seemed based on anything close to a concept of ""play."" I remember a lot of being forced to sing ""Freres Jacques,"" and I can hardly blame the kids who knew it wasn't cool to do that stuff. It wasn't, and I doubt anyone, teacher included, got anything important out of that stuff. In 1976, Canadian music teacher Hans Fenger was inspired by Orff's concept, and decided to commence on a project involving students from several elementary schools in the provincial Langley region, British Columbia. By his own admission, Fenger knew little about teaching music to children, but trusted the kids' grasp of what they liked enough to arrange this project. Chiefly, this project involved recording a group of students in a school gym on two-track, performing their favorite tunes and playing instruments developed by Orff (for use in his Schulwerk program). The recordings were never supposed to be widely distributed, until producer/author Irwin Chusid (Songs in the Key of Z) heard them, and the decision was made to make them available worldwide. So, in the end, a completely local, unpolished music education project is now at the fingertips of serious music fans everywhere. Strike one up for Canadian taxpayers. Of course, if you were skeptical that the results could match the inspired enthusiasm, I wouldn't blame you. The thing is, these people put so much joy and interest (trust me, having interested kids is never a given for teachers) into the proceedings, that they make this CD good by sheer force of will. The opener, Paul McCartney's ""Venus and Mars/Rock Show,"" captures the ridiculous amount of feeling for which the kids have for this music. And they sound good, too! ""Good Vibrations"" features bells and acoustic guitar (standards in Orff's program), and adds a little authenticity to the mix by bringing in the sleigh bells like Brian used to do. The singing and arrangement are actually a tad on the melancholy side, much more restrained and poignant than you'd think a group of grammar schoolers would be capable of. In fact, throughout the album, the prevailing mood is often quite somber. Perhaps, as Fenger postulates, the students loved songs that evoked loneliness and sadness, or perhaps they just felt so at ease playing music that they couldn't be bothered with being hyper and unfocused. David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" is one of many highlights here, as again the kids have the downtrodden verse melody mastered, and even coordinate the countdown with some pounding percussion. Plus, someone in there is dropping some serious spook-organ, and another kid is going crazy on the special effects guitar. It's an amazing track, followed by another, ""The Long and Winding Road."" Now, I don't really even like this song-- it may be one of the worst songs the Beatles ever recorded. However, the Langley Schools arrangement for solo vocal (one of a few on the CD) and humble piano accompaniment brings out what was apparently actual inherent sincerity in the tune. The record isn't an all low-key affair; later, the kids bring out the noise in the Bay City Rollers' ""Saturday Night"" with stomping and cheerleader chanting that only fifth graders can make legitimate (which begs the question of how grown men ever performed this song). They pull out the same stops on Herman Hermits' ""I'm Into Something Good"" to similar effect (and begging the same question). My favorites, though, are their versions of ""Desperado"" and the Carpenters' ""Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft."" The former is another incredible solo vocal version of a tune that I always thought was extremely cornball. I would go so far as to say that this version of the song, with a young singer performing with so much heartfelt, delicate emotion I seriously almost cried, is definitive. The latter begins as yet another solo vocal, though the full choir joins in quite soon, along with bells and swelling cymbals and bells. You'd think they were really announcing the next wave of civilization, saying goodbye to the modern world in favor of something less image-conscious and much more honest and plain fun. They even changed tempos in the middle. Now, in all honesty, a whole record of kids, albeit inspired, singing your 70s AM Gold hits has a greater-than-zero potential of getting a little stale after a while. There's a wonderful feeling listening to this record that all will be well with our world, and that as long as the children are happy and singing, we have nothing to worry about. But after a while, if I need to put on some AC/DC or something, I hope they don't take it personally.","Most kids go through some kind of music education in school; probably in elementary school, as secondary schools usually don ...

Your New Boundaries,Clairvoyants,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e0ea9e61561daa5236/1:1/w_160/577ba4f7.jpg,2002-01-05 06:01:40,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1483-your-new-boundaries/,Wishing TreeBadman,"If the early '90s was the era of the Breeders (just pretend, okay?), the early '00s just might be the era of the Brooders. The Brooders, led by an exciting cast of unmanly, oversensitive, introspective introverts, make music that is often euphemized as sad-rock or slow-core. Even the euphemisms are negative. This should tell you something. It just so happens that Badman Recording Company has devoted its label to giving the suicidal among us a public forum. Job requirements at Badman are minimal-- a guitar, a voice, and a Prozac prescription. Talent scouting involves rubber gloves, a good eye, and a psychiatrist's dumpster. All the hard work has come with mixed success, scoring Badman some winners (e.g. Hayden), some most-of-the-time winners (e.g. Mark Kozelek), and now, a guy who could use a little boost. Counseling, maybe? The man of whom I speak is named Brian Dunn. Dunn fronts a five-piece ensemble known as the Clairvoyants who presumably gain strength from being by themselves, yet spend much of that time lamenting their own solitude. Dunn's songs are slow and monotonous, dominated by several elements, the most notable of which is nothing in particular; it makes you wonder what the other four people were doing. And as for the monotony, I'm curious as to which mnemonic Dunn uses to keep the songs separate in his head. Besides for the plethora of nothing, Dunn's voice occupies a decent amount of the foreground. It's a familiar one, a gaunt, meatless blend of Nick Drake, Chris Isaak and Brave Sir Robin's lead Minstrel. Now imagine compiling the orchestration of the first two and subtracting three out of every four notes, and you have, roughly, the Clairvoyants. Aroused? Maybe if you're a sloth. A big part of it lacking emotional power is the oh-so-bad lyrics. Oh, they are so bad. In ""Surface of the Water,"" for example, Dunn whines that, ""You need me to keep you/ From harming yourself/ I know it's futile/ I know it's futile."" He enunciates ""futile"" with the anal precision of James Lipton. It comes out as the perfectly pronounced compound of its components-- ""few"" and ""tile""-- with loads of emphasis on the ""tile"" part. Under a microscope, the Clairvoyants might make you wretch. However, if you do as I did and take a few steps back (concentrate on the Super Bowl, cook some dinner, IM your ex-girlfriend), Your New Boundaries makes for decent background music. The tones of Dunn's voice combined with his tasteful backing band are mellow, somber, and well-produced. But you can answer this question as well as I: is your record collection lacking ""decent background music?"" Is this a gap you need to fill? Do you really need stuff that absolutely refuses to grab your attention? Wouldn't your money be better spent on one of Badman's good releases? The answers are likely no, no, no, and yes. A wise move would be to set your new boundaries just short of the Clairvoyants.","If the early '90s was the era of the Breeders (just pretend, okay?), the early '00s just might be the ...

Let Me In,Bobby Birdman,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b75e6ef9596932049f/1:1/w_160/a441d466.gif,2002-01-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/716-let-me-in/,Hush,"A party is no place for introspection. Yet, when I'm thrown into an environment surrounded by people, most of whom don't know me, I tend to find a quiet corner. Sure, a party is supposed to be a social gathering, but for whatever reason, I just can't help being lulled into a space where only I exist. Thankfully, Chad Crouch and the crew over at Portland, Oregon's Hush Records have made available a series of records under the ""Anti-Rock"" banner. Lacking ambition or exuberance, Hush records are perhaps the most conducive records available for those inappropriately introspective moments. And Bobby Birdman's debut is no exception. Bobby Birdman is Rob Kieswetter's stage name, and even sounds like a 1960's throwback sort of pseudonym, which happens to perfectly reflect Birdman's music. Singing of love, ominousness, and being cold, Let Me In reminds one of the Microphones' Phil Elvrum was he to lose his analog fixation and begin toying with a Powerbook. But in traditional Hush form, these electronics are about as subtle as Björk's swan dress, remaining calm and atmospheric. Accompanied by simple drum machine loops, a lulling, strummed acoustic guitar, and these inorganic treatments, Birdman's voice resembles a tired Stephen Merritt trading in the throaty tenor for a smoothly delivered, wispy croon. ""I Must Admit That I Love You"" opens the record gently with a manipulated cymbal fade-in, which is overtaken by a primitive drum machine line resembling one of those credit card metronomes that were used in my middle school orchestra class. Not that this comes across as silly, but the aura of Let Me In resounds of little ambition and even less groundbreaking. A bassy drone complements Birdman's voice as he moans the album's eponymous line. The melody is sweet and nostalgic, and remains as such throughout the rest of the record. ""Moving On/Up"" and its instrumental counterpart, ""Paradise Dub,"" are based upon decelerated drum loops. An acoustic guitar lazily strums a single chord in time with the percussion, with leads the way for Elvrum-esque vocal ""ahh's"" in harmony. ""Moving"" melds into ""Paradise,"" which plays the loop offset with a very subtle reference to the chord progression of the previous track. ""Golden Arms"" follows, an almost a cappella number backed by light backwards guitar lines. The lyrics, once again, draw a line to Elvrum: ""I walked up the hill/ Into the dark/ Out of my body/ I moved undetected."" ""J Tear"" begins with a gratuitous three minutes of Birdman repeatedly counting out waltz-time with some echo manipulations, before fading into another mellow acoustic guitar number. ""Hey Now"" is a gorgeously simple song enshrouded in vocal harmonies, calming down to ""Such an Icy Feeling,"" another quasi-a cappella track in which the voice clicks from slight electronic manipulation, while quiet drones hum in the background. The record reaches a poppy apex with ""Blue Skies,"" complete with acoustic drums, other people's voices, and a sing-along chorus: ""There'll be blue skies/ Nothing but blue skies."" Yet it never broaches the in-your-face border and collapses into a looped-vocal coda, after which Birdman breathes his last moan with the closer, ""Perfect for Light."" On the whole, Let Me In may bore some with its lack of motivation and the seeming absence of passion, but to me, it seems like Let Me In was created for my wrong-place, wrong-time introspection.","A party is no place for introspection.

Outer Space/Inner Space,Flanger,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc1eb335119a49ecf32/1:1/w_160/99d75cb4.gif,2002-01-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11740-outer-spaceinner-space/,Ninja Tune,"Screenwriting guru Robert McKee once joked that the shortest book possible would be a history of German humor. He said this, I believe, without having read a single interview with Markus Popp. The dour German stereotype may be common for people in the States raised on ""Sprockets,"" but it's just not accurate. Exhibit A: Flanger. Look at the front of this record cover: Atom Heart and Burnt Friedman standing on the barren surface of some distant planet in full astronaut gear. Only it's not really them, just some cropped press photos of their faces pasted into jpegs pulled from the NASA site. They look so damn goofy standing there on that planet, but they're clearly in on the fun. And then there are long-winded the liner notes, written by a fellow named James Dean Brown, which claim, ""The only way of downscaling Burnt's musical-conviction potentiometer is to previously install a logical bypass."" On second thought, Mr. Dean Brown could be on to something. A potentiometer is an instrument for analyzing electrical potential, and Outer Space/Inner Space is vastly superior to last year's Midnight Sound because it contains so much more possibility. Both records are basically light cocktail jazz manipulated via computer, but where the source of Midnight Sound's crackly, raw material seemed nebulous, Outer Space/Inner Space is a crisp recording of live musicians who put some energy in their playing. Hearing this more ""natural"" approach bumping against the electronics gives the record a great deal more tension than the sleepy Midnight Sound could muster. It also makes the listening more fun. The third track, ""The Men Who Fell from Earth,"" is a nice illustration of what I'm talking about. The opening section blends percussive static hits with manipulated drum runs of inhuman tempo, and then the piece abruptly transforms into lazy downtempo lounge for a couple of minutes before accelerating once again into spastic glitch music. Each individual part is rendered properly, but you'd never imagined that they could fit together so well, or indeed, that they could fit together at all. ""Lo Dernier Combat"" is another track that seamlessly modulates from Medeski, Martin and Wood-style instrumental jazz to abstract electronics and back again. The skill here is in the transitions-- not only are they not jarring, but each stylistic shift seems perfectly logical. Odd guitar treatments crop up here and there, courtesy of enigmatic Cologne musician Josef Suchy, lending another intriguing texture. The tracks that fall outside the conceptual framework still impress with their melodic sense and rhythmic interplay. Though the album was no doubt edited on computer and it's quite possible that none of the musicians actually performed together (the notes list separate recording studios for each of the instruments), the infectiousness of the Latin beats is undeniable, and the three Chilean percussionists credited help give the record an impressive syncopated pulse. ""Inner Spacesuit,"" in particular, absolutely bubbles with rhythm, and it always makes me wish I had a drink of some kind in my hand when I hear it. But this straight-up track has a surprising coda, as the rhythm fades and Suchy's processed guitar harmonics take over, sending the piece spinning off in a completely different but equally attractive direction. Both funny ha-ha and funny strange, Outer Space/Inner Space is worth exploring.","Screenwriting guru Robert McKee once joked that the shortest book possible would be a history of German humor.

Party Music,The Coup,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a680c0084474cd0c09a4/1:1/w_160/b31d2840.jpg,2002-01-03 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1633-party-music/,75 Arkz,"Oakland-based rappers the Coup are about as adamantly political as hip-hop comes. The original cover art for Party Music, planned long before the events of September 11th, and originally intended to go to press on that fateful day, featured an image of the Twin Towers exploding, with the two rappers posturing in front of them-- one holding conductor's batons, the other holding a detonator. The image, says the duo, was intended as a metaphor for the effect music can have on a corrupt system. 75 Ark said no. A last minute phone-call stopped the presses and the cover was redesigned. Still, no doubt, the Coup will go down in history as a strange footnote to a tragic day, the unfortunate timing of the album cover remembered long after the music. And that's too bad, because Boots Riley and Pam the Funkstress deserve to be remembered for their music. You see, the Coup knows the secret to effective politicization: before you can change people's minds, you have to engage them. Like Public Enemy and George Orwell before them, the Coup focuses on the art, not the politics, trusting that if they do one right, the other will follow suit. The result is music that questions the common presumption that all things political must also be dry and boring. For one, the Coup's is a sound drenched in R&B; and soul tradition, holding more in common with Outkast's raucous funk-driven beats than it does with similarly minded rap groups like Cannibal Ox. As such, the Coup are likely to reach an audience less accustomed to these types of ideas. Wrapping their political missives in twisted, slithering rhymes like, ""This is my resume/ Slash-resignation/ A ransom note/ With proposed legislation,"" Riley and Pam prove that the music is every bit as important as the politics. In ""50 Million Ways to Kill a CEO,"" the Coup demonstrates a wickedly dark comic sensibility, taking the cartoonish tendency towards violence often prevalent in popular rap music and applying it to an uncharacteristic victim. Among their suggestions: ""Toss a dollar in the river/ And when he jump in/ If you find he can swim/ Put lead boots on him and do it again/ You and a friend/ Videotape and the party don't end/ Tell him that boogers be sellin' like crack/ He gon' put the little baggies in his nose/ And suffocate like that/ Put a fifty in the barrel of a gun/ When he try to suck it out/ A-ha!/ Well, you know this one..."" For the less murder-inclined, Riley and Pam offer a few slightly less radical solutions to societal problems; simple things like rebelling against unjust authority or merely choosing a stance (""Take a look around/ And be for or against/ But you can't do shit if you ridin' the fence""). But things really hit their stride on ""Get Up,"" where guest MCs stic.man and M-1 from Dead Prez intone, ""It's a war goin' on, the ghetto is a cage/ They only give you two choices; be a rebel or a slave,"" while a group of female vocalists sing an atypical mantra in typical R&B; backup singer style: ""You're 'sposed to be fed up right now/ Turn the system upside down."" The Coup cater masterfully to a wide audience, always holding fast to their values. Only once do they stray too far in their attempt for a broad listenership. ""Heven Tonite"" is the requisite sensitive rap song, and while the lyrics are stronger than most in this maligned subgenre, any sentiment is negated by the Swiss-cheese guitars lifted right off a smooth jazz station. Party Music doesn't quite pick itself up in the two songs that follow, but by this point, it doesn't much matter. They've already proven themselves worthy, and a few weak songs do not a weak album make. There's been a tendency since the World Trade Center attacks to keep talk of political dissent to a minimum. In the meantime, our leaders have continued to act in their own best interests, using the current wave of patriotism as permission to hold open the federal wallet to corporations, cut funding to important programs, and refuse to sign the International Nuclear Arms Treaty. Meanwhile, the press reports little-to-none of this, fearing the possible consequences. In times like these, groups like the Coup become that much more important. Party Music is an effort both entertaining and politically motivating, a feat which many have attempted but few have successfully pulled off. Perhaps its radical message will succeed where other dissidents have failed: in galvanizing those who've become disenchanted with our fearless leadership of late, and in introducing a few others to the healthy practice of skepticism.","Oakland-based rappers the Coup are about as adamantly political as hip-hop comes.

Stay a Little Longer,Melochrome,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4215e6ef959693239b7/1:1/w_160/660df701.gif,2002-01-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5214-stay-a-little-longer/,Loosethread,"Here I am at the bottom again. Thanks to Ryan's system of review placement (the lower the rating, the lower down you go), I always seem to occupy the nether regions of the review column. Which begs the question: am I getting all the shitty releases, or am I just that hard to please? It used to be different. It was more of an arbitrary editorial decision, and I lobbied for a return to that system earlier today. ""Jefe,"" I said, ""you should really push this Melochrome review up into the featured spot. Give me-- uh, I mean them-- some exposure, some hype."" ""Yeah? What'd you rate it?"" ""Uh... so. How about those Bears?"" Where to begin? Oh hell, let's just dive in. The songs don't take shape; rather, they lose shape, unraveling along the way. They go from a sketch to a blank page; from a metal frame to a pile of wind-blown rust. The persistent problem is long length with no real development or point. The songs try to build up in delicate layers, with all the chance of a souffle at O'Hare. Even Melochrome's sole, half-hearted attempt at rocking-out, ""Summer Jens,"" feels miserably out of place. The successful exception is the instrumental centerpiece, the seven-minute ""Aqueduct"" which mixes some mildly interesting two-fingered guitar work with found-sound and a song-long shimmer. This type of gentle, meandering instrumental immediately recalls the Six Parts Seven's work (and not only because of the e-bow). Also, the closer, ""Boyfriend,"" has some piano and violin interplay to make up for its undeveloped melody and dirge-like progression. But that about sums up the good. A compact example of one of Stay a Little Longer's more grand flaws can be found on the third track. ""The Years Go By"" begins innocently enough, a pleasing mix of strummed changes and keyboard diddling going hand-in-hand through commonplace chord progressions. With the first couple tracks, singer Prammod Tummala had already established that his soft nasal singing is strained at best and seizure-inducing at worst, so that's not really a surprise here. But then the boy/girl vocal-trading comes in. Personally, I found bassist Darlene Poole to possess one of the most distasteful voices I've ever heard. She sounds like Joey Lauren Adams on Sudafed. Now, plenty of folks love Ms. Adams and think her voice is just fine-- even sexy. That's great. They would probably dig Darlene, too. However, I don't associate with that kind of folk, because I'm just that kind of guy. So, that's what really did in half of the album for me. Just as Kevin Costner can ruin what would be an otherwise perfectly fine Hollywood movie merely by being cast in it, Poole's singing is the death knell for Stay a Little Longer. A horrible, off-key, piercing knell. I can't help but think that if there had been exciting, challenging music to counterbalance this effect, the whole affair wouldn't have gone down like a whore named Titanic.","Here I am at the bottom again.

Discography 1994-1997,Anasarca,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08f13d19756521383f6/1:1/w_160/b23c9656.jpg,2002-01-02 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/176-discography-1994-1997/,Second Nature,"Emo? Screamo? Don't listen to them-- the shit is metal. What's worse, it's metal that denies you that payoff that comes with a corny, bloody-fingered guitar solo you can direct your frustration and derisive laughter at. In fact, there's not much to laugh about here at all. Unless boring, trebly, palm-muted guitar riffs and really, really bad emo screaming are particularly funny to you. The obligatory: Anasarca was a D.C.-area five piece that recorded very little in their three-year existence, yet somehow managed to earn themselves a substantial fanbase and subsequent ""influential"" status. And influential they are. The music on this seven-song retrospective will definitely influence me to drop their CD into the garbage incinerator chute on my next trip to the elevator. In discussing why it is I despise Anasarca, there are two main issues that merit attention: the music and the singing. To their credit, guitarists Chris Afzal and Carl Riddle-- and even the rhythm section of bassist Jim Sajor and drummer Mike Weltz-- churn out standard, sometimes even kinda pretty metal-core background music. The kind that could get you hopping around and pumping your fist if you were into baseball caps, no-girls-allowed-type shows in small, sweaty venues, and being an angry, WASPy teen. Not to their credit, on the other hand, is Nick Pimentel's hellishly silly voice, which lets the steam out of the other four guys' boring but at least thought-out musical arrangements. Remember Cobra Commander from the ""G.I. Joe"" cartoons? (Hint: he was the one with no face, screeching like his voicebox was on fire.) You might have assumed that all this time he was living off the residuals from his glory days. Or maybe you thought he'd fallen through the social service cracks and resorted to squeegeeing motorists' windshields for spare change at a random inner-city intersection. Anything is possible, but we know for sure what he was doing from 1994-1997: he was Nick Pimentel, frontman for Anasarca. Granted, his abrasive ""I-don't-do-notes""-style singing has, since 1997, become an established vocal genre of its own. But I personally see no reason to explore the roots of this fine tradition. To the songs, then. ""East Bunk Hill"" and ""Eugene Debs"" are the first and second tracks, but are so similar that we'll just speak of them as one: Stop-start-stop. ""Aaaaiiighhhhyyyyeeeee!!!"" Stop-start-stop. ""Grgrgrgreeeeeeee!!!"" The guitars drop out, then the bass plays some non-committal but vaguely ominous part for a few bars. ""Aaaahhhhhhkkkkghhh!!!"" Things get appreciably better on track three, ""Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt,"" though maybe ""A Couple Things Weren't Awful but the Vocals Still Hurt"" would have been a more honest song title. This song, as distinct from its two predecessors, actually makes use of melody! It even sports a clever, building intro, lively drumming, and a two-vocal part. Track four, ""Stationary People,"" also flirts with singability in a fairly pleasant manner. You almost wonder if there's more to Anasarca than their half-hour discography suggests. Which isn't to say the track is great. It sounds sort of like the demon from The Exorcist covering an Offspring song, but whatever. Shit looks tall when you're in a crater this deep. ""Enginize"" starts off positively wussy. Was Anasarca having a rough day? We don't know. But in any case, the song's intro is the prettiest moment in the band's whole history. Of course, you can guess what comes next: ""Aaaaiiighhhhyyyyeeeee!!!"" Good, you've been paying attention. Of the seven songs, this track earns silver honors. ""You Know"" and ""So Tell Me"" finish things out in monotonously rockin' fashion, the former showing flashes of guitar-player consciousness; the latter earning the first place with its rare dynamism and the successful two-voice arrangement. And then... sweet silence. If you're a fan of this genre, save yourself the trouble of e-mailing me your thoughts, add another bunch of points to the rating, and enjoy. If you're not, just remember Cobra Commando. Knowing, my friends, is half the battle.","Emo? Screamo? Don't listen to them-- the shit is metal. What's worse, it's metal that denies you ...

It's the Black-Eyed Snakes,Black-Eyed Snakes,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2dec0084474cd0c0140/1:1/w_160/b1c2afb5.gif,2002-01-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/755-its-the-black-eyed-snakes/,Chairkickers Union,"Throughout his career with Low, Alan Sparhawk's commitment to brooding slowcore has been unparalleled. His newest LP, the debut from his blues trio the Black-Eyed Snakes, displays his brooding versatility. Here, he exchanges the romantic, wistful, and clearly Caucasian tones of the slowcore indie-brood for the coarse, soulful brood of the blues. Although not nearly a blues pioneer, Sparhawk, along with drummer Brad Nelson and guitarist Bobby Olson, displays a studied faithfulness to the genre. For the most part, the sound is vintage electric Chicago blues, employing a raw two-guitar attack that buzzes with the dirty sound of overworked amps and blown speakers. To give the reptiles some balls, Sparhawk's ordinarily sweet, reflective vocals are made crude by innumerable filters and feedback. The Snakes' songs range from traditional to unconventional. On the traditional side, the album opens with two foot-stomping guitar duels, ""Chicken Bone George,"" which could pass for the work of another George (Thorogood), and ""Smokestack Lightnin',"" a cover of the classic Howlin' Wolf tune. Willie Dixon's legacy is preserved later in the album with a limp cover of his Chicago blues staple ""Mannish Boy,"" replete with screaming teenagers and poorly executed lyrical riffing. And ""New Orleans"" is the band's finest blues original, built around a laggard guitar riff and wailing harmonica. Less conventional are the neo-blues manipulation of Moby's Bessie Smith sample, ""Honey,"" a blues/post-punk hybrid cover of the Fall's ""My New House,"" and a Snakes original, ""Big Black Train."" The front-porch rhythm section and twangy guitar on ""Honey"" is likely to funk-up even the most ardent Moby haters. ""My New House"" is anomalously ambitious, playing with contemporary effects and production before dropping back into a traditional, overdriven blues jam. ""Big Black Train"" uses song-structure familiar to Low (but with more sonic power): a four-chord progression, intensity built around simple, shifting dynamic elements like tempo and volume, and repetitive, single-stanza lyrics. But conceptually, the Snakes could use a hand. Sparhawk pulls a Chris Gaines with the project, adopting a moderately retarded, self-created alter-ego named Chicken Bone George. My understanding has always been that bluesmen earn their nicknames, either by genetic defect or tragedy of misadventure. Whatever Sparhawk's reasons-- be it to help him remain in character, or simply as novelty-- it doesn't do much for the authenticity of the product. Everyone who will buy this album knows who George really is, and knows that he's been party to lyrics as sappy as, ""I held your last breath in my hand/ I held your last word in my heart."" Not exactly the pained expressions of a motherless, devil-pledged outlaw. Sparhawk could especially do without some of the more contrived extensions of the persona. For example, his bluesman posturing is both ill-conceived and poorly executed, as on ""8-Inch Knife,"" where ""George"" delivers an unnerving exhortation for spouses to kill their philandering husbands (with oversized cookware). Sparhawk's goofy bluesman voice sounds like a bad Elvis impression, and the content is plainly silly. Unfortunately, Sparhawk's failure to ""sell"" Chicken Bone George is persistently distracting. He would have been better to keep his own name and forget the act. When an artist engages in music appreciation, as the Black-Eyed Snakes have with the blues, there's always the question of what makes the update worth buying. In this case, the answer isn't obvious; the majority of the effort is straight traditional blues, without any indie flair or flavor to it (apart from Sparhawk's indie-cred). It can be pretty entertaining if you're in the right mindset, but it's nothing Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Willie Dixon or Robert Johnson haven't already done, and done better.","Throughout his career with Low, Alan Sparhawk's commitment to brooding slowcore has been unparalleled.

Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By,Lovage,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6dabf31b7dc7155f4b/1:1/w_160/45a69439.jpg,2002-01-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4876-music-to-make-love-to-your-old-lady-by/,75 Arkz,"I walked up to the local community college on a whim. It seemed decades since I first realized that any prospective goals I had could only be achieved through a commitment to academia, but for years I'd lacked the vigor to take any steps toward ""realizing my potential."" So, as I entered the admittance office, I bore a sense of pride that had been all but foreign to me since high school. After the necessary paperwork had been filled out, I was presented with a number of options for possible courses. Only two piqued my interest: one cryptically titled ""Cultural Literacy and Criticism""; the other called ""Nathaniel Merriweather's Deconstruction of the Modern Eros."" I had no idea what ""Cultural Literacy"" could possibly mean and, having gone to public school, I decided it was probably instituted for aspiring writers. So, under the impression that I'd have more opportunities to utilize my talents as a writer than as a lovemaker, I opted for ""Cultural Literacy and Criticism."" Initially, I was plagued with regret. It had come to my attention that Mr. Merriweather was to have a very strange assortment of characters guest lecture before his class, and the resident prelector of cultural literacy, one Dr. Nayr Rebierhcs, was hardly concerned with churning out the next Shakespeare. For the first few days of the course, I was completely in the dark as to what he hoped to achieve by talking about the ""science of wit,"" ""litmus tests for cultural relevancy,"" and ""the tragic dictatorship of media-induced opinion."" But eventually, things began to fall into perspective. On one particularly enlightening occasion, Dr. Rebierhcs was instructing the class on effective literary devices: ""We shall begin,"" he said in his usual didactic bravado, ""with the most primitive device a critic must keep in his canon: the analogy. We'll start with a very simple example and then move onto more esoteric selections. Darren Aronofsky's Pi is to independent cinema as Will Cullen Hart's Circulatory System is to independent music."" The class reacted to this with varying degrees of inquisition, but eventually came to the consensus that the statement was plausible. The doctor's eyes scoured the room, finally settling on mine. ""Mr. Adickes, can you give us an example of analogy?"" I struggled for a few moments and then thought of Mr. Merriweather and his motley crew of ""sexperts."" I stammered out, ""Mike Patton is to sex as Abe Vigoda is... to sex."" Lovage meets every expectation one would have for an ""all-star"" line-up, had their preconceptions of an ""all-star"" group been defined in the 80s with the release of Band-Aid's ""Do They Know Its Christmas?"" Or was ""Heal the World"" the prototype Dan the Automator followed when assembling the likes of Prince Paul, Kid Koala, Plug 3 of De La Soul, Jennifer Charles of Elysian Fields, and Mike Patton to create a self-parodying album about doing the dirty? Regardless of where the formula originated, someone needs to crack a window 'cause it's gone bad. The album begins, modestly enough, with an endorsement from Prince Paul, the Automator's partner-in-mediocrity from Handsome Boy Modeling School. This sets the tone (and, incidentally, the tempo) for the remainder of the record. As flourishes of mandolins and a sampled brass section segue into ""Pit Stop (Take Me Home),"" the album's thematic developments come to a jarring halt thanks solely to the absolutely wretched lyrical content. All but one song was written by Dan the Automator (aka Nathaniel Merriweather), Jennifer Charles, and Mike Patton, and each sounds like something a cocktail waitress would find scrawled on a napkin freshly slipped to her by a roaming businessman. ""I think a pussy's your best bet/ Stroke that shiny coat/ Stroking is the antidote/ Stroke that/ It's a start/ Only for the wild heart."" I've listened to this album ten times straight and the genius of these lyrics, which find Jennifer Charles graphically chronicling a menage a trois, has managed to elude me. The music is infinitely more tolerable, though it occasionally becomes as garish as the album's art, which is horrible even by the lenient standards of kitsch. Here are some basic musical ingredients which, if all mixed together, would give you a fair idea of the Automator's musical approximation of ""love-making"": Nino Rota: The Godfather sdtk. James Brown: ""It's a Man's World"" Rene Lalou: La Planete Sauvage (psychedelic interludes only) Enya: Shepherd's Moon Massive Attack (if wounded): Blue Lines Samples about venereal disease Now that doesn't bode very well, does it? The negativity doesn't end there, I'm afraid. My biggest gripe about Lovage is that it finds a number of clearly talented artists constructing the same song continually without variation. Kid Koala, for one, lays down some nice turntable work, but is never allowed to exercise his full potential. If the mood strikes you, songs like ""Sex (I'm A)"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" can be mildly affecting. But the sensuousness of many of these tracks relies solely on Charles' heavy breathing and husky voice, and somewhere around the ironically titled ""Love that Lovage, Baby,"" the potency of her moans begins to wear off. Which is why none of this makes any sense: if there's anything Nathaniel Merriweather hates, it's impotence.","I walked up to the local community college on a whim.

Wingfoot,Parker Paul,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00fb1335d7bf1697f2f/1:1/w_160/31790fcf.jpg,2002-01-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6194-wingfoot/,Jagjaguwar,"As a Zappa album title once asked, does humor belong in music? Well, yes and no. It all depends on artist or album. It seems like one of the hardest things for musicians to accomplish is to write songs that are both genuinely funny and musically valid-- something more than just novelties. Zappa did it on a few occasions (but then again, if you release dozens upon dozens of albums, you're bound to have a few successes), and then there's Ween and the Dead Milkmen, both of which frequently pulled off the balancing act. On the other hand, there are bands like Barenaked Ladies who try to impress with a constant stream of pop culture references and end up with unforgivably annoying frat-boy sing-a-longs, and Ben Folds who half-assed his way through both his ""serious"" and ""funny"" songs, undercutting them both. Of all the recent attempts to tread this fine line between quality and humor, Parker Paul does it better than almost anyone. A former member of the Charlottesville, Virginia-based band the Curious Digit (which also featured Adam Busch, currently of Manishevitz), Wingfoot is Paul's second solo disc. Piano and other assorted keyboards remain the musical fulcrum here, as they were on his debut, Lemon-Lime Room, but Paul has rounded out his sound on Wingfoot with help from a host of luminaries from the Chicago music scene like Jeb Bishop (Vandermark 5), Fred Lonberg-Holm, Wil Hendricks, the aforementioned Adam Busch, and Songs: Ohia guitarist Dan Sullivan. And as a bonus, the whole deal was committed to tape by Michael Krassner of the Lofty Pillars and Boxhead Ensemble. On the surface, Parker Paul strongly recalls Ben Folds, if only because all his songs are piano-based, but a better comparison might be Randy Newman-- or, to go outside the realm of music, Woody Allen. His songs, like Allen's best films, use humor to explore themes of existential dread and anxiety. But whereas Allen's tone is neurotic and self-deprecating, Paul's is bemused and detached. On Wingfoot, nowhere is this better exemplified than with ""When I Got You at the Pound."" Preaching salvation by means of a pet dog (and remember, dog spelled backwards is God), Paul sings to this canine messiah after seeing a show on pet therapy for the elderly: ""Last night I dreamt of heaven/ All of our names on your collar."" The song also features the best lyrics about sifting through dog vomit that I know of: ""Night crawlers and blades of grass/ Shifting continents in egg yolk/ Lincoln's profile in the morass."" Elsewhere, Paul tackles the human condition with ""Pain, Pain, Pain, Pain, Pain"" (take a guess what it's about) where he reveals, ""Catholics propose pain is the path we all should have chose/ But the Unitarians are much more interested in fun."" Yet what saves this song is from being a simple joke is the same thing that saves Paul from being a simple novelty: the little lyrical profundities he tosses in the middle of everything, like on ""Pain,"" which ends with the lines, ""Hold something in your hand/ Set it down, say a prayer, walk away."" Written here, it doesn't seem like much, but in the context of the song, it makes all the sense in the world, clicking like a Zen koan in the mind. If you're paying attention, most of the songs on Wingfoot have these little lyrical nuggets, but if you're not careful, they'll float right by like Marshall McLuhan's cameo in Annie Hall.","As a Zappa album title once asked, does humor belong in music?

At least it wasn't held in the office. But Schreiber wouldn't pay for train fare and Chicago was fucking freezing and I got so many dirty propositions that the walk felt like the Senate antechamber. I wasn't interested in Martin(a) and her ""package deal,"" though, so I ducked into the VFW Hall. All the new kids were gathered around the punchbowl, making small talk and ladling nervously. I circled the room, browsing conversations: Richard-San was pitching the fork like a grizzled sea veteran with Paul Cooper nodding politely, Sage was pouring liberal amounts of scotch, and Buckman and Leone were talking gibberish about ""Yamatsuka"" and ""Kawabata."" Ethan P. was up in John Dark's face about something, but I didn't want to get involved. Someone was missing, but I couldn't remember who. The party improved after alcohol was drunk and Avalanches were played. Fueled by some gin and too little tonic, I started to wander. Turning the corner, I came face-to-face with some indie kid-- the cocked eyebrow, baggy trousers and tongue poised to spit words like ""motorik"" marked him as from either the Fakejazz or Splendidezine conventions down the hall, for sure-- but we passed with little more than the ""industry nod."" Down in the next wing, the strains of some sick sound caught my ears, like a ghost bored into domestication. The sign on the door said ""International Association of Muzak Licensers and Muzak Engineers: Annual Meeting."" I slipped inside and stood up against the wall. ""Are your clients tired of traditional Muzak? Need a new way to capture your customer's brand loyalty? Gen-X has been tuning out our messages for years; it just isn't receptive to edutainment anymore. But there is a solution. La Makita Soma is Muzak for the filtered generation, designed specifically to rock out and yet keep the profits rolling on in. I understand they call this 'post-rock' here in the Windy City. You've got jolly little keyboard melodies, merry vibraphones humming in time, and drum crashes in all the right places. Every sound is carefully leveled out in the production process, leaving the results smooth and synthesized. And darn if that guitar solo doesn't match the best Muzak classics-- I'm hearing Santana's 'Everything is Coming Our Way!'"" Oh god, it was awful. Kraftwerk posing as kinky robot fetishists was one thing, but I've never heard a group of musicians so pleased to sound like a Casio keyboard demo. It was like they'd boiled instrumental rock down until anything remotely lively and threatening had evaporated, and the distilled essence of suck just oozed out of the speakers like medicinal syrup. The pseudo-psychedelic jam on ""Glossalalia at 47th"" made me wonder if I'd downed a valium. The entire Prozac Nation might still be bored by this roofie-rock. Oh yeah, and there's a sample of kids playing at the beginning of the title track. Kids. Playing. I was just coming to understand the need for mood medication when I heard it: dink dink dink. ""That's right, folks, 'The Makita Five' even comes up with a new musical genre! We call it 'electroniska,' because it has the lilting upbeat of ska music. That's a twelve-minute song with enough wild solos and calm segments to satisfy consumers and investors alike! After all, there's nothing like a little reggae to spruce your step when you're 'Lost in the Supermarket,' eh? Get it?"" The ska riffs stabbed into my mind on and on and on, but they were far from halcyon. The label reps kept referring to Brighton Park as techno, but it sounded like the downfall of western civilization to me. They'd used pedals as general anesthetic, delay and reverb and wah-wah all combining into a soupy mixture spilling out of the busted cornucopia of third-rate Tortoise bargain basement jams. Then a woman asked a question: ""How will La Makita Soma affect the market in light of the new wave of recordings? We're nearly finished with the Specials' Gangsters. Will the release of Brighton Park hurt our Return-on-Investment for Rat Race?"" The guy chuckled. ""La Makita Soma cares about demographics, ma'am. That's why we've included a rapper on 'Spaceship.' Hi-Fidel will broaden your outreach sector when he talks about 'Reptiles armed with projectiles/ Criss-cross in the night sky like African textiles.' There's your urban and science fiction markets in one verse!"" I spun and ran back to the welcoming arms of Daft Punk or whatever it was the staffers were playing. Brent Sirota looked me right in the eyes and shook his head. He knew, and maybe O'Rourke did, too. The new year didn't look so bright anymore.","The Pitchfork holiday party was weird.

""The only thing that kept us off the air was that they wanted to do it with a laugh track, and I wanted to do it with a live audience. That was the only way they were going to sell me,"" he says. ""What would have happened was you'd make that exchange; the writing of that character becomes broader... because I'm pushing the envelope to get laughs, because instinctively I know how to work an audience, I know where to go."" To some, it might seem like Black is being a little picky, yet another victim of the ages-old beggars-can't-be-choosers rhetoric. But anyone who's ever stood before a crowd of onlookers-- be they eight or 800-- and performed, knows the difference an audience makes. For many, the audience is a terrifying factor; one they'll do almost anything to avoid. But for a select few, the audience is as necessary to the creative process as watermelons and giant hammers are to Gallagher (to stick with the stand-up theme). It's the catalyst that kicks them into gear, starts the adrenaline pumping, and allows them to tell jokes, play music, dance, act, or do whatever it is they do on a level they'd be incapable of reaching otherwise. Bullfrog, a Canadian band gaining crazy-style exposure thanks to their turntablist, Eric ""Kid Koala"" San, would seem to fit into this latter category. Ever since I came to the conclusion a while back that Koala is God's gift to the turntable, I've made a point of collecting recordings and catching him wherever I can. And I must say, that when it comes to live performance, his band Bullfrog puts on a hell of a show, stepping up from their backing role on Koala's Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and generally holding their own. Bullfrog's music isn't anything stupendously original (they function as a laid-back combination of hip-hop, funk, R&B;, and Phish-y hippie music, not unlike, say, G. Love and Special Sauce), nor are their lyrics particularly demanding (despite song titles like ""Ya Ya"" and ""Ababa"" which might suggest otherwise), and the content rarely elevates above standard party-rockin', good-time-havin' fare. By all logic, Bullfrog should suck royally. But something about the live performance galvanizes the band. Live, they're on top of their game, a great party band, and ready to start the motors of even the most initially indifferent crowd. But when it comes to recorded music... well, maybe Bullfrog should've taken a cue from Lewis Black. Try though they might to capture the spirit of their live performances, the generally lackluster nature of Bullfrog's self-titled debut proves that the band just isn't the same without an audience to play to. Sure, Bullfrog has its moments. ""Slow Down"" is nice enough, teetering between a cappella 50s-pop and laid-back reggae-inspired jam-band fare; ""Bullfrog Theme"" carries a certain confidence not present elsewhere in the album; and Kid Koala's collage intermission ""Extra Track II"" is a fun mockery of music industry politics. Unfortunately, these are the exceptions, not the rule. Though all six members of the group remain technically proficient or better, they generally lack the energy and passion in a recording session that makes their live show so much fun. One gets the feeling that someone at Atlantic realized this at some point as-- presumably to capture some of the energy of the live show-- someone has taken the liberty of peppering this recipe with various clips from live performances. However, the recording quality of Bullfrog's live content is, to put it gently, fucking terrible. Many of the live tracks stop or start at awkward moments in the middle of songs, vocals echo across rooms, much of the content sounds canned and muffled, and Koala's contributions are often mixed far too low, making them impossible to hear over rollicking drums. Rather than adding spice to the flavor, these tracks stand out like an ugly hair at the bottom of your soup. Ultimately, this package reeks of having been thrown together on the run (no doubt in an attempt to capitalize on Koala's Touring-With-Radiohead status before the Yorke groupies forgot his name). And while its tough to criticize a band for attempting to grab hold at what's likely their best bet for success, it's a damned shame it had to go like this. They may not be the most amazing band in the world, but Bullfrog deserves better than this. Maybe the future will bring us a proper live album from this band, but in the meantime, potential listeners would be better suited holding their breath till the band rolls into town.","In the new issue of Chunklet, comedian/angry guy Lewis Black discusses why his proposed sitcom never got off the ...

Dean Quixote sdtk.,Various Artists,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e1c0084474cd0c0a82/1:1/w_160/e8366ee2.gif,2002-01-01 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7861-dean-quixote-sdtk/,spinART,"As each day passes, it becomes more and more difficult to write a truly gratifying pop song. Part of the pop equation relies on a sense of spontaneity that has become increasingly elusive as listeners have now had, debatably, seventy-five years to construct an emotional immunity to the same unvarying formula. There are always those who will invert the standard for successful songwriting, leaving the accessibility to the less daring. Then there are those who acknowledge the inescapable grasp and scope of their musical heritage and imbue their own music with enough inventiveness to endure repeated discriminating listens. Unfortunately, many seemingly creative bands merely stumble upon whatever unique sonic deviations earmark their respective ""sound"" and, once they have it patented, infuse it with every damn Beatles/Chuck Berry regurgitation they write. So it should be said that while an original technique is an occasional indicator of true talent (i.e. Phil Elvrum and his affinity for right/left channel panning guitars) true judgment should be reserved for the frequency in which you actually listen to the artist's recorded output. This is the best way to delineate between talent and plain sticktuitiveness. So what do you do with all those outstanding songs mired in between album-filler and the token ballad attempt? You make a mix tape. Orion Walker expresses his love of mix tapes in the liner notes of the soundtrack to his film, Dean Quixote. ""There's a lot of great music being made... but you'll never hear this music unless you look for it. Or unless you're lucky enough to have a friend that makes you a mix tape..."" Indeed, Orion Walker seems to be a man of sage-like advice and the psychedelic murmuring of his mix tape to us, his audience, only reinforces the notion that he's a thinking man's man and his taste is nigh impeccable. The album commences with the Olivia Tremor Control's ""Jumping Fences"" which, after nearly five years, still evokes the same paradoxical euphoric dystopia as it did on Dusk at Cubist Castle. There is no conceptual analysis of the modern pop song to be found, as on Black Foliage-- just Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss stretching their comparative musical muscles and setting the ambience for the vast majority of the record. Elephant Six dignitary Robert Schneider seems to pop up randomly throughout the course of the album. His band, the Apples in Stereo, are well represented with the inclusion of ""What Happened Then"" from the hit-and-miss Discovery of a World Inside the Moone, and his Orchestre Fantastique offer up the film's theme, ""Stars on the Sea."" All said, Orchestre Fantastique sounds like incidental music for 70s educational programming, but within the context of the album, its breeziness is easily overlooked-- especially when compared to the Beachwood Sparks' ""This is What It Feels Like (Alt. Version)."" Both of these tracks, which would normally undergo a far more jaded critical knife, actually provide a fair definition for the album: a group of artists offering their winning interpretations of the ""archetypal pop song."" The Minders turn out a piece that's not entirely dissimilar from what Nick Drake's instrumental ""Bryter Layter"" would sound like if interpreted as elevator music, and Spink (whose name should really be changed if they wish to gain an ounce of respect) cover the Palace Brothers' classic ""New Partner."" Elsewhere, Songs: Ohia stay around just long enough to infect your blood with the catchy-as-all-hell ""Hot Black Silk."" Though it may be impossible for Jason Molina to escape the Will Oldham comparisons, he shows here that he has the range (musically and vocally) to transcend a few of those stylistic similarities. The remainder of the album is similarly engaging. Robert Pollard, who is supposedly close friends with Walker, appears in the film and donates the underrated gem ""If We Wait"" from the generous ten-song Sunfish Holy Breakfast EP. And, like such revivalist luminaries as Goldfrapp and the Squirrel Nut Zippers in their more sultry moments, Crystal Keith and Kim Fox come to the radical conclusion that the seduction of lounge music didn't die in the 40s with their contribution, ""O What a Noble Mind Is Here Overthrown."" I'm glad to say that I haven't seen Dean Quixote. Hearing these songs free of their intended context seems to have nourished the area of my brain that would have been deprived of stimulation had I watched this film at the local art house. So I'm taking the purist's route. The visualizations I've conjured up are more fantastic than anything that can be committed to celluloid. Life just can't be contained in 24-frames-a-second, and rather than have the film inspire the soundtrack, I've allowed the music to catalyze my generally dormant creativity. The only flaw in my plan: my expectations for the actual film have far exceeded the very constraints of cinema. This soundtrack has ruined it all for me.","As each day passes, it becomes more and more difficult to write a truly gratifying pop song. Part of the ...

Home of the Cannon Saints,Red Shirt Brigade,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a233ea9e61561daa49a1/1:1/w_160/9e835120.gif,2002-01-01 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6721-home-of-the-cannon-saints/,Arborvitae,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I should start off by saying Red Shirt Brigade are Pitchfork advertisers, keeping us staffers in turtlenecks and knickers well into the new year. But this palm-greasing in no way affected my estimation of Home of the Cannon Saints, and I can, with a clear conscience, say that this is THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME and Red Shirt Brigade are BETTER THAN THE BEATLES... hell, they're even better than Badfinger. (Okay, boys, how's that for quotes for your press kit? On a completely unrelated note, I accept Paypal and credit cards payment through Billpoint, just so you know.) All sarcasm aside, this actually is a pretty damn good album. Not groundbreaking or revolutionary, but intelligent, full of hooks, cheesy yet fun keyboards, and a lot of energy that manages to steer clear of angst or emo-boy whining. It's the kind of solid album you listen to on a cold winter's day and easily get lost in its bright, unaffected exuberance and forget about your worries for awhile. Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla produced Cannon Saints which goes a long way toward describing Red Shirt Brigade's sound. They display the same kind of smart melodicism and rhythmic variety that keeps things consistently interesting, even though they're operating within a relatively narrow framework-- that is, punkish pop/rock played on bass, drums, guitar, and keyboards. Home of the Cannon Saints starts off with a minute-long drone before the first proper song, ""Thugs with Venom,"" which is album's best track. Tempo changes flow gracefully from one to the next, and bright, angular guitar lines are balanced with genuine fist-pumping moments of distortion and riffage. It's accessible without being watered down or simple. In a kinder world, it might even make commercial radio. But Cannon Saints doesn't blow its wad right away; there are other pleasures to be had here. The very next track, ""Later on in the Whole Word,"" with its waltzing rhythm, somehow brings both Nirvana and Wings to mind, in the same way that Dismemberment Plan sounds like both Genesis and James Brown. Likewise, ""Years of Skulls,"" sounds like an imagined Dave Brubeck foray into modern rock with Morrissey at the mic: very precise, almost cold, but infectious, its melody setting up shop in your brain and staying there. Dismemberment Plan offers a good overall point of comparison to Red Shirt Brigade's sound. The young band obviously took notes while listening to Emergency & I, expounding on the feel of the Plan's masterpiece and capturing a lot of its energy without sounding too derivative. But while the Dismemberment Plan is fronted by one of the most charismatic and creative singers in the biz, Red Shirt Brigade lack a similar strong, confident leading personality as yet. But, then again, on the Dismemberment Plan's debut disc, Travis Morrison hadn't really found his voice yet, either. And that's the feeling Cannon Saints leaves you with: a lot of potential, but just not quite there yet.","In the spirit of full disclosure, I should start off by saying Red Shirt Brigade are Pitchfork advertisers, keeping us ...

An Evil Heat,Oxbow,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2aeb335119a49ec967/1:1/w_160/664d0126.jpg,2001-12-31 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6075-an-evil-heat/,Neurot,"Out of this summer's furnace, their first album in five years. Oxbow, apostles from that small seam of true, gut-wrenching horror. Oxbow, who stink of phlegm and germs and unprotected sex. Oxbow, whose live shows frighten even the few converts who've come to see. Hard music born of slow, corruptive bile from deep down inside, not the tantrums of chugging cheerleaders of doom. They'll put the lie to your grindcore bands right quick. With titles like ""King of the Jews"" and ""The Balls in the Great Meat Grinder Collection,"" it's not hard to fathom Oxbow's lack of fame. But you'd think the foursome would at least be known for their frontman-- if only for the hecklers he's beaten down in his day. There are few spectacles like Eugene Robinson, more than six feet of black muscle standing downstage, thighs spread, brief-clad crotch thrusting forward, eyes rolling in holy fervor. The crowd steps back a few feet and eyes the exits. The two-track opener, ""The Snake & The Stick,"" finds him perched in the pulpit more than ever before. Cursing, shouting, screaming from the background, his cries come like those from the drunks you see stalking down the street, lost in their own private stew of hate. At the same time, he whispers up close with allure: ""One Sunday morning, the preacher went a-trawling/ To the House of Fuck, he come a-calling."" A raspy voice admits, ""I got couch sluts of every stripe, sir, boys and girls and the in-between types,"" and right afterwards the band busts into an exaltation of Sabbath riffage. Might as well strip your clothes off, burn your Preacher comics and bask in the squalor because Garth Ennis ain't never going to come close to this freaky. In times past, Oxbow sounded somewhat like labelmates Neurosis, or a spoiled Birthday Party. An Evil Heat cools the fire just enough for a slower burn. The main hooks of these songs seem blues-based, at least at the beginning, as you're reeled in. ""Stallkicker"" opens with a rough blues crunch, and the cymbal crashes resonate like electric shocks. It even ends with a brief coda of almost pretty guitar picking. But they return to their trademark queasiness-- a sidelong slither between noise-rock and metal-- on ""S Bar X,"" on which former Swan member Jarboe guests. Her low moans circle his high-pitched keens until it all mashes together in a swirl of seething feedback. Given all the old folktales of forks in the road and deals made at midnight, the whiff of blues here makes sense. Scent-words seem to be the most appropriate; there's an odor of pheromonal aggression that's just tangible on this record, and it alternately sickens and succors. Rarely have I been so thoroughly seduced after an averse reaction, and rarely have I been so driven to get up and thrash around and feel the blood pulse through my veins. ""Skin,"" in particular, grips me until I'm aware of the sad state of my own flesh, what with the brutal whip of the snare and the tale of ""the cockhorse, teeth like sugar cubes/ Play the blues, balls hanging/ Between his between, like crab apples... hating his hide, and hiding his hate/ Potentate of the small, and the great."" What wages do you earn after the sins of the first half-hour? The other half: a thirty-two minute (near) instrumental by the name of ""Shine(Glimmer)."" It builds in buzzing bass drones and dives back down into distortion, endlessly climaxing and clenching up and coming at you again. It's a primal jam, fueled by pure carnal libido, so get together with some inclined bodies and slap skin together. An Evil Heat may not be for everyone, but you're going to keep an open ear-- it's been too long since you've listened to anything this hard. So kneel yourself down now, and look upwards at old Eugene. It's time for your confession.","Out of this summer's furnace, their first album in five years.

Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With,King Crimson,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba8eb335119a49ecab6/1:1/w_160/672a880d.jpg,2001-12-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4442-happy-with-what-you-have-to-be-happy-with/,Sanctuary,"In music, there aren't many things as dependable as your rock heroes inevitably churning out bullshit. It happens to the best at some point or another. Maybe they rebound (Dylan, Costello), maybe they don't (McCartney, Prince), but it's telling that, as listeners, we often fall into the trap of treating our music like amusement park rides, expecting bigger and better thrills with each passing year. Now, I'm not arguing for constant entertainment; a saturated experience that fills voids we didn't even know existed. And despite the perennial letdowns, I wouldn't expect these musicians to take critical reactions any more seriously than television static. A million critics can be wrong-- just ask the next person who isn't fooled into believing prog is inherently bad. (Quick, there's another one!) But would it be too much to ask for a new wrinkle now and then? Guitarist Robert Fripp formed King Crimson in 1969 with Michael Giles, Ian McDonald, and future-total-embarrassment Greg Lake. Their debut record, featuring brooding Mellotron, dark, epic, ballads, and Fripp's signature brainiac-laser guitar lines (especially on the classic rave-up ""21st Century Schizoid Man"") helped define progressive rock in its earliest stages, and is still held as one of the most important records of the genre today. In the 70s, the band worked through various lineups, and eventually settled on a group featuring Fripp, ex-Yes drummer Bill Bruford, John Wetton, and David Cross (not the bald comic). That band managed to almost single-handedly defy all stereotypes thrown at prog, not only by being one of its greatest proponents of free improvisation, but also by just rocking the hell out of the world's concert halls. In the 80s, Fripp brought in guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew and turned the band into a tightly wound New Wave machine-- imagine Talking Heads crossed with Don Cab. And in the 90s, the band mixed and matched all of these sounds, pleasing pretty much their entire devoted fanbase. Until now. You see, the problem with Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With-- a compilation of new stuff, studio pisstakes and one live track released to satiate the poor-fan's crave until next year's full-length-- isn't that King Crimson have abandoned their sound or moved away from what made them so interesting, but that it's a culmination of the last few years' stagnation. From the ""Frippertronics"" (Fripp's patented ambient guitar technique), to the ""eclectic"" percussion instrumental, to the ""funny"" ""blues"" ""tune"", there's a not-so-thin film of decay drenching almost every moment on this set. The two new ideas-- the first being the title track's depressingly out-of-touch stab at xFC-metal; the second being the studio cut-n-paste of ""Einstein's Relatives""-- seem, by turns, desperate and unnecessary. 2000's The Construkction of Light hinted at complacency, but was at least energetic. The title track is the worst offender on the record, opting for ham-fisted satire of bands that King Crimson shouldn't even be aware of (they toured with Tool recently, and I can only imagine the late-night hilarity on that tourbus) at the great expense of the jam. ""I have some words/ This is the way I'll sing/ Through a distortion box/ To make them menacing,"" sings Belew. Ha ha, he sure did bite Korn there-- next up, King Crimson exposes the idiocy of Milli Vanilli and 50s game shows. Belew throws in a few practice rounds on auto-harmonizer just to show he's still got Peter Frampton's number, and ""Potato Pie"" is the embodiment of filler. Perhaps even more frustrating, there are some okay songs, too: ""Mie Gakure"" may be old-hat ambience for Fripp, but it's nice nonetheless; Belew's ""Eyes Wide Open"" proves that he is the world's finest imitator of a David Byrne/John Lennon hybrid mutant, and that he can write a pleasant hook when called for (even if the song does recall moments from just about every Crimson record on which he's appeared). But alas, these are drops in an increasingly empty bucket. Better to burn out than fade away? Say it ain't so.","In music, there aren't many things as dependable as your rock heroes inevitably churning out bullshit. It\n\ happens ...

Where Leaves Block the Sun,Bevel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a292ea9e61561daa4a98/1:1/w_160/58699e9c.jpg,2001-12-31 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/681-where-leaves-block-the-sun/,Jagjaguwar,"It pretty much goes without saying that a vocalist can make or break a band. The wrong set of pipes can ruin a sound; the right one can elevate the emotion of the music beyond any meaning in the lyrics. It also goes without saying that there are plenty of people out there who can't really sing in what we'd think of as a traditional sense. Carrying a tune seems simple enough, but it's remarkable to consider just how many voices out there aren't built for it. Bevel is the solo project of Drunk's Via Nuon, and let's just say that he's one of those millions of people who wasn't endowed with a naturally melodic larynx. Part of the problem seems to be in his delivery-- he doesn't project at all, and notes can even get lost as he trails off. On the other side of the coin, though, he's a fantastic guitarist, and he can be mesmerizing when he wields his acoustic. And so it follows that, somehow, Nuon's lackluster vocal performance doesn't really get in the way that much on his debut release as Bevel. He's composed 13 different paths down the folkways of America, and the haunted nature of the music usually allows his sometimes downright antimelodic delivery to settle in and get the job done, however awkwardly. It certainly helps that he's joined by fifteen high caliber musicians, from members of Souled American, Lambchop, and Dirty Three to Chicago session players like Fred Lonberg-Holm, Jessica Billey, Jason Adiesewicz, and Michael Krassner, who've played on records ranging from Pinetop Seven to Edith Frost to Wilco. Yet even with all that talent, there's nothing flashy about Where Leaves Block the Sun. Instead, it prefers to stay on the periphery, decorating your atmosphere in much the same way that a real bevel might lend character to a piece of wooden furniture. It opens with a gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumental called ""Exitrance,"" setting up the orange and brown autumnal theme of the music with its thoughtful melody and warm fingerpicking. ""Generosity"" is the first song to feature Nuon's voice as he tackles an oddly singsong melody as best he can over a textured background of vibes and guitar. 'Textural' is the operative descriptor from here on out, as virtually every song explores some variation on a basic acoustic musical texture. By and large, the days get a little shorter toward the middle of the album, as the darkest textures are explored there. Icy pianos spread like frost around warmly bowed violins, and Steven Dorocke's steel guitar occasionally rises in the background like steam rising off a mug of cocoa. While his singing may not be amazing, Nuon does manage some fine lyrical moments, such as the line, ""Every engineer hates every other engineer's work,"" from the middle of the wasted ""Liquid Burns."" ""Siberian Sunrise"" lives up to its title, with sprightly little guitar melodies trickling over a frozen, droning tundra like the first rays stretching across a frigid wasteland. And the instrumental ""Theme for Harold"" may as well be the Siberian Sunset, as everything is plunged back into darkness and bitter cold. Perhaps the most unpretentiously beautiful moment on the album, though, is ""Oklahoma,"" a brief, 1\xBD-minute interlude featuring nothing but Michael Krassner's starkly recorded piano set alongside what sounds like a field recording of a supermarket parking lot. It's a truly transcendent moment that perfectly sets up the final track, ""Prologue of the Recalcitrance."" Here, Nuon offers a fractured verse over an improvised backing before simply turning the musicians loose, ending the album on a chaotic yet consonant note. Where Leaves Block the Sun is an ephemeral pleasure, much like walking beneath the changing foliage of fall and feeling those first few stiff, cold breezes of the year. Bevel never strive to drive anything home, instead offering it to you and letting you decide what you want to take with you. And while that's appealing in its own way, this is certainly not an album to throw on just any old time. On certain occasions, however, it will work nicely at night. Especially when the leaves are turning.","It pretty much goes without saying that a vocalist can make or break a band. The wrong set of pipes ...

The Ends Against the Middle EP,Anti-Pop Consortium,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b2ea9e61561daa460d/1:1/w_160/a4683bf2.gif,2001-12-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/210-the-ends-against-the-middle-ep/,Warp,"Ex-Pitchfork writer James Wisdom done a bad deed with his review of Anti-Pop Consortium's first album. Tragic Epilogue a 6.5? It's not some underground classic, but their mix of sharp rhythms and relentless rhymes made for a tight debut, even if it left a cold, chemical aftertaste. I'm not coming all ""saviors of hip-hop""-- Wisdom had a point: too many loops made for monotonous grooves, and their dense wordflow tried too hard to intimidate. Overly bleak maybe, but not surprising; hell, Anti-Popper Beans even cites Bauhaus and Section 25 as influences. But along with Mike Ladd's Parliament-ary Afterfuture and the Infesticons' Gun Hill Road, Tragic Epilogue was one of those mindtrip albums of 2000 that could send you to a heaven at least somewhere in the 7.0s. So hopefully we can give props to the Consortium while avoiding some internecine staffer warfare. Anti-Pop's on Warp now, and for a second you might think the label's looking to duplicate the success of Cannibal Ox. ""Tuff Gong"" fires off rattling tin can percussion and a raw, bombastic bassline reminiscent of everything on The Cold Vein. M. Sayyid spits some typical insults at first, but then the song cuts to this organic double-bass skronk and he doubletimes, tongue almost audibly flapping. He balances precariously, nearly losing it, but ends on point with, ""You pulled out a nine/ I turned into a green light and ran over your mind."" ""Tuff Gong"" is clearly an intro track, and ""Splinter"" follows seamlessly with some duke-duke-duke of earl-style vocals and a nice, understated keyboard melody. Beans' warm voice begins, ""Fillin' em with penicillin and Benadryl/ Drillin' a fillin' and spillin' my feelings."" His delivery's always smooth but I'm struck by the excitement-- nobody's detached like the last joint. Likewise, M. Sayyid snarls eagerly, ""I got crowds movin' like U.N. flags."" Somebody's got to fall off though, and here, it's High Priest. You can pinpoint right when his freestyle degenerates into a bastardized Kool-Keith grocery-list recitation, the kind of flat flow that heads always hate in ""progressive"" hip-hop. But Priest redeems-- regular Anti-Pop producer Earl Blaize steps back to the engineer role for this EP, and each of the three MCs get a chance to shine on their own tracks. Priest proves the skills that got him on Mille Plateaux's click-hop comps. He crafts ""39303"" from random beeps and babbling samples, mixing it all together suddenly as Beans launches into an abstract monologue. It cuts off too quickly, probably the only problem with this EP: most tracks just seem sketches. But Priest's next piece, ""Pit,"" distracts attention once again with an instrumental full of divebombing pitchshifts that squeak like Kraftwerkian birds of paradise. Beans' ""Dystopian Disco Force"" and M. Sayyid's ""Perpendicular"" go the more mainstream route. The latter develops into a DJ Muggs-style trip-hop ditty, and the former is straight-up funk, organ runs and wah-wah guitars included. Were there any instrumentals at all on Tragic Epilogue? Must have slept through them, if so. But this EP just constantly keeps your head bobbing. They've extended the challenges of vocal freestyle to the music, and the improvised weirdness avoids the dull loops Epilogue fell into. ""Vector"" ends with another vocal track and the upbeat meter is perfect (likewise the buoyant, humming Moog). The Consortium seems to have learned that Anti-Pop doesn't equal mind-numbing, machine-like music. I'm just hoping the experimental tip transfers to their new album in 2002. The Ends Against the Middle is only a 17-minute EP, but unlike their fast-forward-guy logo, when this finishes, I'm ready to rewind.","Ex-Pitchfork writer James Wisdom done a bad deed with his review of Anti-Pop Consortium's first album.

Antidote,Jenny Toomey,by: Daphne Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7deb1335d7bf169914d/1:1/w_160/3e377492.jpg,2001-12-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8107-antidote/,Misra,"Jenny Toomey, indie-rock luminary that she is, has come a long way as both artist and interlocutor since Tsunami's final album, 1997's A Brilliant Mistake. She left her Simple Machines label to begin the Future of Music Coalition, putting herself in the precarious situation of being an devoted artist with no time for art. Somewhere in the midst of these four years was catastrophic love-- a heartbreak so tragic and special it warranted a double-disc. Both her pedigree and tendency for advice date her; these are not the tales of a wide-eyed youth. Yet, where time almost invariably wears on musicians, leaving them without so much as a shred of inspiration or cultural relevance, Toomey has remarkably managed the unmanageable: she's aged while maintaining her grace. Antidote's 16 tracks range between bitter (""Patsy Cline"") to resigned (""When You Get Cold""), and borrow some of the best talent offered by the two cities each of these discs respectively represent: Chicago and Nashville. The Chicago disc features not the first names that come to mind when you think of the city, but arguably more interesting ones in these post-post-rock days: engineer and ex-Pulsars member David Trumfio, Trip Grey on drums, super-cellist Amy Domingues, Aluminum Group frontman John Navin, Drag City crooner Edith Frost, and violinist Andrew Bird (of Bowl of Fire fame). Nashville artists Jean Cook and Lambchop member Mark Nevers (who has also engineered albums for Leann Rimes and Vic Chesnutt) fill out the lap-steel and slow, caramel-drip sadness of the Nashville disc. The Nashville selections languish in the inflection of lost love. Long legatos, brushes, and sprinkles of piano color Toomey's ruminations, her voice recalling the punctuation of Natalie Merchant and the lilt of Sam Prekop-- full and strong without the sense of virtuosity that could ruin its context. By the third track, ""The Smell of Him,"" Toomey has proven the strength of her moodsetting; the song oozes style with soft angles and upright bass. The steel-laden ""Artful Dodger"" takes the most chances of these songs. Toomey's vocals fall outside the beat, her melody picked above the slow procession of chords. It's a strange, Verve-like moment of violin tremolo and stylized country made all the stranger by Toomey's lyrics, unrhymed, articulate and serious. The Chicago disc packs up the sad strains and sends them off on defiant bursts of horn, beating them with dance rhythms and washes of distortion. It opens with ""Patsy Cline,"" a tongue-in-cheek advice column for ladies who love their pre-modern men. ""Clear Cut"" takes the borderline-cliché metaphor of doing away with love entirely and remodels it. And ""Breezewood P.A."" pulls Toomey's cynicism to the fore with the opening lines, ""If I took advice from editors of certain teenage magazines that dictate style for teenage scenes and guidelines for romance/ I'd surely speak with more reserve on certain sparks."" All this in a showtune-style bed whose nuances call to mind Jim O'Rourke's willfully commercial pop solo work. This disc almost seems a response to a questioning of her musical intent. She answers by allowing her crew to convert simply good songs into great ones. The band employs their greatest tricks-- Domingues' crescendos, which bend into subtly hooked guitar lines, are particularly affecting-- and the engineers mix songs like ""Charm City"" with sassy drop-outs and explosive horn sections. When Toomey presented these new songs at Ladyfest Chicago, she explained that, ""They could all fit on one disc, space-wise, but really shouldn't be together stylistically at all. Don't think I'm ambitious because I took two."" Though her songwriting remains characteristic, the treatment given by each pack of musicians is worlds (if only time-zones) apart. If Nashville breathes deeper than Chicago, it's simply because Toomey's strength is her weakness, that her greatest lines aren't windy-city comebacks so much as those questioning the sincerity of love in the land of music.","Jenny Toomey, indie-rock luminary that she is, has come a long way as both artist\n\ and interlocutor since Tsunami ...

Change Is Coming,Money Mark,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39bc0084474cd0c34e7/1:1/w_160/7cb96623.jpg,2001-12-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5395-change-is-coming/,Emperor Norton,"It's tough work being a jack-of-all-trades. For one-time-carpenter-turned-unofficial-Beastie Boy Mark Ramos-Nishita, keeping up appearances alone is time consuming at best. When not collaborating with the aforementioned superstars, contributing his keyboarding aptitude to everyone from Femi Kuti and Santana to Mary Lou Lord, Money Mark writes, produces, and plays almost every instrument for his own solo releases. His albums are increasingly becoming stereo standards for the slick bars and slicker parties where the patrons and guests have better hair, better credit, and more impressive portfolios (in every sense of the word) than you do. But don't hold that against him. It's not Money's fault the high dollar tapas bar down the street plays his discs on endless repeat. If anything, Change Is Coming is a sort of musical guidebook for how to throw your own exclusive soiree in the privacy of your own home. And no worries about the relative provincialism of your whereabouts. ""Information Contraband""-- the album's second track with its samba style beats, swirling traffic simulating keyboards, and Ill Communication-style downtown funk-- creates a big city feel, perfect for that moment early in the party when all the guests have arrived, had at least two cocktails a piece, and have begun mingling loudly in your living room. You'll want your first course to be sweet and sour, a conflicting, yet pleasant taste to complement the airy space-age-meets-metal-guitars-meets-sleazy-funk of ""Glitch in Da System."" Don't worry about scaring off your guests. The combination is unusual, though mild enough to be palatable, even in its moments of dissonance. The high point of the evening comes with the main course: ""Another Day to Love You."" Money Mark would probably recommend something hot and spicy-- an excellent Paella, or some ingenious Cuban concoction-- guaranteed to get the guests riled up, perhaps for an impromptu dance halfway through the meal. ""Another Day to Love You"" sounds something like a 21st century revision on the Buena Vista Social Club, complete with jazzy piano and intricate Latin guitar. The combination is a little sexy. If at all possible, season it with an aphrodisiac, because things are gonna stay pretty steamy throughout the rest of the album. Even on the dance numbers. ""People's Party (Red Alert)"" comes off like uptown disco, despite its jazzy horns and squealing flute. The crowd can migrate to the dancefloor to sweat off dinner before you serve dessert. Something with a tropical flavor is recommended to accompany the cruise-line Muzak of ""Use Your Head""-- your guests are guaranteed to like it, even if you integrate leftovers. ""Use Your Head"" originally appeared on the 1996 Red Hot Compilation, Red, Hot, and Rio. Money Mark understands a great party doesn't always necessitate completely original material. Bid farewell to your guests and get to work on those dishes with ""Rain (NYC)."" The background recording of an actual rainshower will prove a soothing counterpart to your faucet. The melody here bears a remarkable resemblance to a certain George Gershwin penned standard/lullaby, especially when supplied by Ulises Bella's trill-heavy clarinet. So, even after all the excitement of the evening, falling asleep shouldn't be too much of a challenge. A perfect party. A perfect soundtrack to your perfect party. You'll sleep like a baby, and inevitably wake to realize that Change Is Coming doesn't play so well by the light of day. Stripped of its social-hour context, it sounds like a kitschy, ersatz reproduction of a Beastie Boys album without the vocals, and a little too much like that Cocktail Nation disc you found in the used rack at your favorite record shop for $3.00 a couple years back. You remember immediately why you bought that disc (""This is gonna be great at a party"") and why you never played it (""When do I have those kind of parties? In fact, do I even want to have those kind of parties?"") And then you remember the novelty of Mark's Keyboard Repair. You liked it. You really did. But this seems dull by comparison, hopelessly tied to the role of background music. And that's okay. I mean, everybody needs good-- even exceptionally good-- background music from time to time. But is it really worth it to pay full price for this CD? Here's another drawback: if you're not careful, you'll be expected to throw these parties again, and again, and again, regardless of the rapidly depleting funds in your bank account and the mysterious curry dust that has seemed to permanently settled over your whole kitchen. It's a bitch being so multi-talented-- an ideal host, an excellent chef, a friend to the stars, a masterful party DJ. Just ask Money Mark.","It's tough work being a jack-of-all-trades.

Katastrophe Vol. 3,Zmrzlina,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab37b1335d7bf16997d9/1:1/w_160/dfa7d3c5.jpg,2001-12-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8935-katastrophe-vol-3/,Incidental,"San Francisco's Zmrzlina play everything. Well, they sound like they're trying to play everything, anyway. I don't mean to say that the music is necessarily jumbled-- they generally avoid the postmodern pitfall of cramming a hundred ideas into one song. Instead, this band takes a few dozen ideas, catalogs them, and creates lots of little postcards to paste into their album. Only the postcards are the songs (except when they're actually cards, like the inserts that come with this album), and the eclectic ideas seem either ill-suited to the band's strengths (hazy psyche-pop, as far as I can tell) or simply beyond the range of their abilities to pull off. And while I admire any band willing to bring a little eclecticism to the mix, what I hear as the failure to cover bases set forth in the music is a disappointment. Katastrophe Vol. 3 is Zmrzlina's third release. I should give my respects to whoever designed the packaging, because it's rather amazing. All futuristic art-deco and matte coloring, and featuring the aforementioned card inserts-- this is a project I imagine as much thought went into as the actual recordings. In fact, I wonder how a band like this even has enough cash to create something like this, as publishing houses and art directors don't often come cheaply. Design is credited to the group, so perhaps somebody internal had access to a printing press and some serious Adobe skills. So, in summary, props to the designers. As for the music, well, it's nothing if not good-natured. Yet it's often amateurish where it should be accomplished, rough where it should be smooth, and goofy where it should be strange. The first track, ""Supermarket Radio,"" begins promisingly enough with some eerie strings and a looped child(-like?) vocal. This is nice, something of a cross between Bernard Herrmann and Björk, but the song doesn't actually begin until the band enters about a minute in. Disco drums and some wah-wah guitar introduce the ""groove,"" and then everyone drops a mad Blondie beat so vocalist Jeff Ray can expound Fred Schneider style upon who knows what atrocities. There's a running string-line throughout, and the band occasionally returns to the opening neatness. However, I get the feeling that this is the kind of music that sounds better when you have a million bucks to fly a producer in from Iceland to clean up your mix and get a decent drum sound. What it could be: high-gloss transient art-pop; what it is: flat, aimless upstart pop. Elsewhere, on ""Schoolgirls,"" drummer/vocalist Heather Snider lends a gentle, airy lead to some fairly dull (where they should be punchy) strains. The arrangement combines a terribly ""bouncy"" drum loop, laidback guitar strumming and a whipping violin line, thereby prompting me to play rock-critic and call this ""what folk-pop means in the 21st Century"" or possibly ""folktronica."" But that game sucks, and in fact, this tune just sounds unfocused, ending with a long guitar solo that wouldn't have sounded out of place at Lynyrd Skynyrd show. There are cool parts, too: ""Creek Lullaby"" gets the down-home groove right with some nice guitar picking and a relaxed beat, even managing to throw in a disorienting vocal loop. The song is perfect for a light buzz, and it helps that the band doesn't stretch out this concept so long that I lose interest (which they do quite often on the rest of the album). ""Kentucky,"" which features more of the annoying talk-singing from the first tune, manages to be too long and yet not dull in the slightest. I give credit to Ralph Carney's moaning woodwinds (on loan from Tom Waits' band), and the fact that the stone-somber vibe I get from this tune suits Zmrzlina to a tee. I'm telling you, if they put out an album of all psychedelic funeral marches, I'd buy it and like it. Those are the high points on an album I would say is at least a few edits and/or omissions shy of something consistently interesting. It's not that Zmrzlina aren't creative; for all I know, they're all great artists on the verge of the next big movement in rock. But there comes a time when your grasp has to keep up with your reach if you want to inspire. Of course, this doesn't happen everyday for artists, but when it does, people take notice and new classics are born. Perhaps, Katastrophe Vol. 3 is just a stepping stone to future greatness, or maybe just a misstep altogether. Everything they're doing could be nice, given different contexts, but sometimes just everything isn't enough.","San Francisco's Zmrzlina play everything.

Crossing with Switchblades,Scared of Chaka,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3689d034d5c69bf2df9/1:1/w_160/3fb305e0.gif,2001-12-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7014-crossing-with-switchblades/,Hopeless,"Boy, do I like the punk rock music. It has a special place in my heart, being the teething ring of my distant-past musical awakening. Before I was converted, my taste was pretty, well... let's just say ""tepid."" I went from Billy Joel to Dead Kennedys in the space of a summer. You want to talk about an exhilarating change in worldview? Try digesting ""Chemical Warfare"" after thinking that the hardest-sounding thing in music was the Stones' ""Midnight Rambler."" Luckily, I was shown the light before any permanent damage was done. (Thank you, Doug Ruby, wherever you are). Prolific, underground vets Scared of Chaka (Land of the Lost, not Ms. Khan) are like a big, punk rock sloppy joe. The trio plays a mix of greasy, gearhead garage-rock spiked with generous doses of So-Cal punk (both old and new schools) and gritty Detroit proto-rock. At their best, Scared of Chaka can even favorably evoke sentimental favorites like the Dead Kennedys (""Permission to Die"") and the Dead Milkmen (""C'Mon, Look Out""). At their worst, they play some very familiar (and consequently, contemptuous) three-chords-and-a-bullet style of fast, hard rock. You've heard it all before, though some of it may be worth hearing again. Marvelously, the 14 tracks fit into 26 minutes. Whip out your slide rules: at an average of 1:53 per, the songs barely have enough time to elicit either a satisfied smile or a grimace of disgust. But they occasionally do have the punch to work, despite their time constraints. The anthemic ""I'm Atomic, Baby"" opens the disc aggressively, with short bursts of raw guitar accentuating blurted, distorted vocals. Three chords, three choruses and out the door. The tempo barely dips on the follow-up jab, ""Why Are You Weird?"" with its hyperactive offbeats and a killer melodic bridge. But after a strong, fast start, Crossing with Switchblades slogs through a relatively tame and boring midsection. On much of the album, the guys get by on fury and attitude as much as on song quality. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as slow, measured fury. Nor does fury have a pop sensibility. Heaping on the irony, you even get one track with a sound very derivative of a band who are themselves derivative: Weezer. At least, I think it's irony... For all its faults and unevenness, Crossing with Switchblades succeeds on a certain straightforward, no-bullshit level-- a level refreshingly free of any pretense or sophistication. In that sense, this album does nothing more or less than remind me of my earliest musical passion. I do still love the punk rock, and Scared of Chaka tries to play it like it was meant to be played: with string-shredding speed, a tinny treble gouache and demonic howling in lieu of singing. And all delivered with a sincere ""fuck you"" attitude that's contagious enough to make you want to kick someone in the head. Which is exactly what I went and did. (Sorry, honey.)","Boy, do I like the punk rock music. It has a special place in my heart, being the teething ring ...

Foxy Music,Mushroom,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41feb335119a49ed890/1:1/w_160/6e707454.jpg,2001-12-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5521-foxy-music/,Innerspace,"The scene, improbably enough, is an all-night Laundromat. Inside, a sinewy, mustachioed fellow is tinkering with one of the machines. His shirt reads ""Mitch."" Not far down a bank of dryers, Randii and Tanya are sporting with one another's silks and satins while their respective loads lumber toward conclusion. Tanya tosses a pair of her unwashed intimates in Randii's face, which Tanya proceeds to sniff-- thus foreshadowing the hot girl-on-girl action to come. By now, Mitch is supervising the panty fight. He interrupts with something about how sensual washers are: the wetness, the churning, the suds. ""Randii gets off on bubbles,"" Tanya volunteers. ""So do you, slut!"" Randii retorts, before implausibly asking Mitch how he got into this line of work. Apparently he's always been good with his hands. Well, Tanya wonders aloud, are you handy with that tool of yours there? By which she is almost certainly referring to Mitch's freakishly large trouser snake and not, I presume, the outsized wrench he has been holding awkwardly this whole time. At this point, Mushroom's Foxy Music begins on cue; such is the infallible logic of porn. Space-rock has almost always been something of a jack-off: a remote, phallocentric, cerebral trafficking in fantasy, produced and consumed largely by the usual host of Moog aficionados, fluent Klingon speakers and hobbits. But Mushroom's thrilling 1999 space-psych-jazz-rock fusion opus, Analog Hi-Fi Surprise managed to bring some much-needed levity and play to the genre. Mushroom tossed the analog weirdness of Füxa, and the jagged experimentalism of Can into a dark, smoking concoction alongside acid-fried Funkadelic, Jack Johnson-style Miles Davis and even some groove-addled Medeski, Martin & Wood. The result was some of the most instantly accessible outrock around, exploratory, up and infectious. Following up the muddy and somewhat ill-conceived remix album, Compared to What (which featured Foxy Music snippets doctored by the likes of post-rock luminary Bundy K. Brown and Faust's Hans Joachim Irmler), Mushroom have transcended the interplanetary party music of Analog Hi-Fi Surprise and produced something downright luscious. The aptly titled Foxy Music melds pornographic funk, searing kraut, lounge-lizard exotica and swirling fusion into something hotter than the go-go girl who graces the album cover. The shimmering Hammond B-3 that opens ""Grooving with Herbie"" returns us to the porno script treatment where we began. Flute and cornet blow acid-jazz loops over Patrick O'Hearn's incredibly tight drumming while the organ rumbles underfoot. ""Grooving with Herbie"" is a clean and crisp foray into funky exotica, conjuring images of lotions and lava lamps, silk robes, gel lighting and sex bereft of awkwardness. ""The Greatest Pleasure in Life Is Doing What People Say You Can Not Do"" is a smoldering mix of garage-psychedelia and dark, smoky jazz. The walking bassline and squawking trombone mingle with Michael Bluestein's intensely bluesy organ. Guitars tweak and wail in the margins. The drumming begins to stutter and loop backwards as ""I Got Blisters on My Fingers"" erupts into bright, distorted guitars reminiscent of the recently departed Michael Karoli's squiggly fusion guitar work on Can's Ege Bamyasi. Michael Holt's Rhodes keyboards are simultaneously rootsy and otherworldly. The explosive ""I Got Blisters"" marries psychedelic blues and experimental kraut masterfully, on top of which Erik Pearson manages to make the flute sound ferocious. It's rich and trippy party music for ass and head. Jon Birdsong's tuba is the standout in the strutting ""Joe Namath."" The fuzzy and dubby ""Namath"" creates a preening, cocky swagger with the unlikely elements of sitar, whining feedback, marching band horns, and delirious guitar shred. The carnivalesque and tweaky title track has so little subtlety it might as well ask you your sign. Foxy Music is noisy, hot and dirty, with Allison Faith Levy's breathy, indecipherable vocals packed into a crowd of screeching violin, electronics, Oberheim processed guitars and furious percussion. The whole thing writhes on the floor like group sex: sleazy, beautiful and breathtaking. You're never quite sure what plugs into what. Mushroom's instinctual experimentalism remains intact throughout Foxy Music despite the bright, insatiable thrust of the album. ""Getting in Thun"" is a strange soupy throb of subsonic bass drone and eerily clanging church bells. ""Don't Blame Me, I Voted for McGovern"" lays a dark, paramilitary stomp beneath warped organs, recalling the unbreakable fusion of prog and fascism that seemed to infest Roger Waters' brain throughout the late 70s. But ""Don't Blame Me,"" thankfully, serves only as a chilling (albeit muddled) interlude in an otherwise recklessly optimistic album. All the album titles on Foxy Music seem plucked straight out of the pop cultural lexicon of the late 60s and early 70s, a time that's already been more carelessly romanticized than any other in modern American history. Yet everyone but the staunchest conservatives are willing to forgive artists for conjuring a mythic time when love was free and sex might just have been revolutionary. So who cares if Mushroom want to indulge in a little escapism? Sex in all its beauty, awkwardness, messiness and danger is a better subject than gnomes and nebulae. Mushroom (along with the inimitable Rollerball) are at the vanguard of movement to make experimentalism sexy again. Not a moment too soon, as far as I'm concerned. And for those of you waiting for some closure on my script treatment, all I can say is this: a burly cop named Hogan shows up soon after the initial threesome. He wants to know what all the ruckus is about.","The scene, improbably enough, is an all-night Laundromat.\n\ Inside, a sinewy, mustachioed fellow is tinkering with one\n\ of ...

Sign EP,Nobukazu Takemura,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71e5e6ef95969320ed0/1:1/w_160/7796ba03.jpg,2001-12-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7919-sign-ep/,Thrill Jockey,"It feels strange reviewing this EP now, since I bought it on vinyl roughly a year ago. At that time, I thought it was the pre-release teaser for Hoshi No Koe, featuring the catchy single ""Sign,"" along with an a capella version (not available on the CD release), another new track, and a lengthy collaboration with some post-rock guys from Chicago. But the CD release of the EP got pushed back, presumably so that the bonus CD-ROM, an animated video of ""Sign"" by cover artist Katsura Moshino, could be completed. To make the CD more enticing, Thrill Jockey has also added ""Meteor,"" a single taken from the now deleted 12"" that was Takemura's Thrill Jockey debut (still worth hunting down for the stunning b-side ""Wax and Wane""). Those who knew Takemura only through his deadly serious (and often brilliant) Scope album were probably shocked by the inclusion of the playful, cotton candy-flavored ""Sign"" on Hoshi No Koe. Here was a single heavily indebted to the World of Nintendo, with a fragile robot singing lead on an actual tune, complete with verses, a chorus, and even a bridge. The deliberately clumsy electrobeat rhythms are augmented by tinny Casio chords and a riff from-- you guessed it-- a skipping CD. This final touch has probably reached its sell-by date at this point, but it does at least sound new in this context, that of sunny twee-pop. I like it quite a bit. Those only familiar with Scope may have been shocked by ""Sign,"" but ""Meteor"" is the piece that first showcased this side of Takemura's personality. Though it serves as the prequel to ""Sign,"" ""Meteor"" is in some respects the greater achievement, and ranks among the finest tracks in the Takemura oeuvre. It starts with a cloud of clicks and slides before bringing in the trademark off-kilter beats around the one-minute mark. Bit by bit, other elements are introduced-- some blocky electronic percussion, organ chords that can't quite hold it together, a random assortment of beeps and honks, and eventually, a disjointed ska rhythm. As the individual pieces fall in, they never quite seem to mesh, instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place, remaining interesting, but separate and unrelated. And then, about three minutes into ""Meteor,"" everything starts to gel as the piece increases in volume, and it finally comes together in a brilliant crescendo. ""Meteor"" is like a musical jigsaw puzzle, and when the pieces finally slide into place, it's exhilarating and supremely satisfying. Unfortunately, ""Meteor"" keeps going for 5\xBD minutes after that mighty peak, spreading the considerable charms of the track a bit thin. For all his talents, Takemura is not the greatest editor, a trait also demonstrated here on the 35-minute collaboration with Casey Rice, Bundy K. Brown, Doug McCombs and John McEntire called ""Souvenir in Chicago."" I like sections of this piece. The first third has an impressionistic quality that I feel is missing from the recent Tortoise I've heard, seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback, terse bass melodies, and Takemura's rich synth chords and processing. About halfway in, the other players drop out and Takemura indulges his penchant for dense abstraction. Again, sections here are interesting enough, but it's difficult to tell what relationship, if any, these shapeless sounds have to the opening section of the piece. Eventually, his processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the other players and the interest level again rises, but overall, this track is just too long and impenetrable. ""Cogwheel"" is another interesting builder in the vein of Hoshi No Koe's ""Anemometer,"" but the lighter tone allows it to blend easily with the other singles (at nine minutes, it's still too long, though). The bonus video is nice, pretty much capturing exactly what you'd expect the world of ""Sign"" to look like, with the flatness of the early Nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game, but with brilliantly rendered characters. But I don't really understand these bonus CD-ROM things-- I guess some people sit in front of their computers and watch them or something. Overall, ""Sign"" is another interesting release for devoted Takemura fans, but not a good introduction for the curious. Still, it'll do while I pine for the next full-length.","It feels strange reviewing this EP now, since I bought it on\n\ vinyl roughly a year ago. At that ...

"Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever",Explosions in the Sky,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd3abf31b7dc7155dea/1:1/w_160/d85fdc31.jpg,2001-12-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2878-those-who-tell-the-truth-shall-die-those-who-tell-the-truth-shall-live-forever/,Temporary Residence,"Most of us spend our lives sleepwalking through the daily routines, and sometimes it takes the ""Jaws of Life"" to rip open the perceptive confines that coincide with a life of ritualism. You awake one morning to the braying tone of your alarm clock and drowsily reach over to turn the damn thing off, only to find that the established procedure for doing so causes no reaction. You press the ""Off"" button two or three more times to make sure you haven't made an error in judgment as your senses become more acute and your emotions inflame. Something has usurped the authority of logic, shattering your rationalizations of many wildly complex and confounding variables, and schooling you in ""possibility."" Explosions in the Sky have elucidated these prevalent truths for me through their epic instrumental lamentations. Though the band are hardly the first iconoclasts of the revered ""verse-chorus-verse"" formula, theirs is a music of possibility like few others have dared to make. On their debut album, How Strange, Innocence, they brandished a sort of restraint that often teased listeners with visions of the group's capability were they only to let loose. The bandname implies scorching collages of noise, yet most of their crescendos end in plucked strings and comforting, ambient gauze. On their sophomore effort, the contradictorily titled Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever, the group has recanted on their more unexcitable tendencies, opting to infuse their work with a formerly unseen rawness and intensity. And even if it's not a didactic analysis of what constitutes ""music"" (such as the Olivia Tremor Control's Black Foliage), it certainly makes for a revelatory listen. ""Greet Death"" opens the album innocuously enough with inaudible strumming that surfaces just long enough to be devastated by seething drums and scathing, distorted guitars. Such previously foreign abrasiveness is an immediate indicator that Explosions have rewritten their aesthetic principles while leaving their ability to wield a stark melody virtually unimpaired. As the dust clears and the sonic damage is assessed, the remaining feedback segues into a sober slide guitar, denoting a major transition in the song's emotional appeal. The track ends as a burgeoning riff of apocalyptic proportions is suddenly and unexpectedly smeared across the audio spectrum with digital effects. These structural inversions are a primary signifier of Those Who Tell the Truth's sound. Arrangements are introduced and then dismantled, as though they're vying with one another for the listener's attention. Mogwai's Young Team is an obvious reference point; both records feature similar instrumentation and soft/loud dynamics. But where Young Team was content to methodically construct its walls of jarring white noise, Those Who Tell the Truth builds more erratically and, upon first listen, illogically. But with every subsequent listen, the internal organization of each song becomes more inviting. Ambiguity seems to be one of the disc's greater appeals. Depending upon your mood, the album can document good versus evil, existential insignificance versus blissful ignorance, war versus peace, or whatever other contrasting forces best suit your life at the moment. Where so many lyricists fail in exacting the perfect sentiment, Explosions in the Sky have crafted a record comprised solely of ever-changing blanks to be filled in. And though each of these tracks supposedly tells stories, one needs only draw upon their own life to understand the pathos explored. May these songs become a soundtrack to your vanity.","Most of us spend our lives sleepwalking through the daily routines, and sometimes it takes the ""Jaws of Life"" to ...

Flight of the Wounded Locust EP,The Locust,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd335e6ef95969322fed/1:1/w_160/939dc8eb.gif,2001-12-17 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4824-flight-of-the-wounded-locust-ep/,GSL,"Even if you haven't heard one note played by the Locust, chances are you've heard a lot about them. As San Diego's leading purveyors of spasmodic Roland-and-cocaine-fueled metal-core (or something like that), much ink has been spilled (and bandwidth eaten up by chat-rooms) for their praise or dismissal. They may be the height of pretension, or they might be saviors of punk (or both), but at this point, only one thing is certain to me, and that's that everyone has a strong opinion one way or another about the Locust, which is in itself a victory on their part. What's interesting about all the discussion that's taken place is how little of it pertains to the actual music the band plays. Most of revolves around the band's fashion sense, their snotty pretentiousness, the violence often inspired at their live performances, or the high prices commanded by official Locust belt buckles on eBay-- anything but the music. And there's a very good reason for this: it's difficult to say anything much about their music. Not that the Locust is all style and no substance-- it's just that their 45-second-long blasts of raw plasma need no explaining. They're self-contained, self-fulfilling, and self-justifying. Some would add masturbatory to the list, but it's still interesting that, as I write this, somebody somewhere is writing a hefty manifesto detailing how all of human cultural history leads up to and finds its culmination in the Locust, when nothing is going to settle the matter better than just dropping the needle on one of their records. But if this is the case, then why this polarity? It's surely not just the music, because strictly speaking, the Locust aren't doing anything incredibly novel. I mean, as I listen to this EP, Flight of the Wounded Locust, I can see a dozen records on my shelf that sound strikingly similar. Even their shtick, if you want to call it that, isn't all that unique. So what is it that causes the pro- and con- Locust camps to argue their cases so vehemently? I'm guessing it has something to do with the stakes involved. Punk is at a critical juncture (possibly more so than ever before) because there's no clear standard bearer. So along comes the Locust, a bunch of kids who used to be in some very influential hardcore bands like Swing Kids and Struggle. They're cocky and cool and cause a stir. People start talking, and they sell a ton of records (by indie standards, anyway). Soon, major labels are interested and the band is half a step away from making videos, despite playing completely inaccessible, obnoxious noise that 99% of the population wouldn't even categorize as music. So with something as ""important"" as the future of punk on the line, everybody interested feels like they've got to get their word in and try to steer critical assessment. As for the music on this 11-track, 10-minute EP, what's there to say? Frontman Justin Pearson screams about rotting animals (not that you'd know it unless you read the lyric sheet). Swirling keyboards play themes for evil circus clowns. The bassist and guitarist try to kill each other with slicing riffs while the drummer plays like Vishnu on meth. Ultimately, it explains itself better than anything I could say. But if you want my advice, buy it, put it on. It won't take you long to form an opinion. And if you don't like it, you'll have no problem selling it back at full-prince on eBay. Especially if put it in a pastry bag and pass it off as a limited edition promotional item.","Even if you haven't heard one note played by the Locust, chances are you've heard a lot about ...

Furia,Kroko,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0a13d197565213b219/1:1/w_160/d85fb649.gif,2001-12-17 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4540-furia/,Verdura,"Kroko are a Finnish band that plays progressive rock, and if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea then skip this review entirely. You heard me, I said ""scram,"" and take your image-obsessed indie t-shirt with you! Nobody wants you here! Come on, take off. Are they gone? Okay, I think they're gone. Now, as I said, Kroko play prog. This isn't flowery symphonic stuff, metal or something that sounds like Alan Parsons. It's more in the school of Zappa, Henry Cow and the Rock in Opposition (RIO) crew, wherein abstraction, noise and improvisation get mixed in with the expected heavy chops and extended instrumental workouts. The band is a trio (guitar, bass and drums), but as you may or may not expect, they make a considerably greater racket than three guys are normally expected to produce. Now, I don't have to tell you that this kind of thing doesn't stand a good chance of catching on with your average rock listener. If you're reading this, it's obvious that you couldn't give two shakes about whether music was trendy or cool or ""fairly normal"" or ""acceptable to regular people"" or ""the kind of thing you could put on and not have people running for cover or giving you condescending stares like you're some kind of super nerd who never gets out and when he does it's probably to buy advance copies of the Lord of the Rings souvenir program."" That goes without saying. And it's the average, non-discerning rock listener's loss to miss out on an album like Furia, because while it's not exactly going to change the world, it's definitely good for kicking out a few jams. Kroko, comprised of Pentti Dassum (guitar), Petri Hissa (drums) and Jyrki Ylikiski (bass) do know a thing or two about tearing it up live. In fact, their website speaks of influences varying from ""jam to jam,"" and the music here supports the theory that they've cut more than a few teeth onstage. Many of the tunes veer off into exploratory, guitar-led excursions that remind me of King Crimson's similar mid-70s concert journeys. Dassum favors heavy distortion, a la Nels Cline or an agitated, Mahavishnu-era John McLaughlin, and Hissa is nothing if not on fire, consistently at the heels of the other two to get a groove on and keep moving. Again, this is the kind of role Bill Bruford played during those classic Crimson shows from the 70s, though Hissa is quite a step more extroverted on the skins, suggesting a combination of folks like fusion master Narada Michael Walden and Ruins' boss Tatsuya Yoshida. The album begins with someone snoring, but the alarm sounds soon enough with ""Ambient Ballad Pt. 1."" I guess the Fins are feeling the irony, as this tune is basically straight-ahead avant super-rock. Crazy overdriven guitar feeds right into the off-kilter, faux-anthemic riff of the opening (reminding me of another quirky prog act, Samla Mammas Manna-- also Scandinavian, and also knowers of the jam). Kroko don't really kick it into something you could headbang to until the next short tune, ""Polanski After Ski."" It's fast, it's in 11/8, it's got tons of cool drum fills and a nifty bass riff-- yes, three songs in, and they're still prog. How's that for attention span? Kroko aren't always high energy, as tunes like ""Sol Ist"" and ""Setzer Au Naturelle"" feature some rather lovely, restrained guitar work reminiscent of Bill Frisell's noir-esque colorings on the non-schitzo Naked City tunes. There are even hints of after-hours jazz, but only for a bit, and then the band returns to their hallowed rev-up/burn-out territory. There are even a few live tracks scattered throughout that give them ample time to ""explore"" their bad selves to everyone's content. Of course, if you're so inclined, there's a whole canon of albums in this style, although most of them are from the 70s, and usually aren't afforded the same reverie as other, more socially (and critically) ""acceptable"" stuff like krautrock or jazz fusion. Besides Crimson (and the aforementioned Samla, Zappa and the Mahavishnu Orchestra), Kroko belong to a lineage that includes Henry Cow and Italy's Area, as well as more recent bands like Anekdoten, Hoyry Kone (also from Finland) and Miriodor. And while I'd love to write up the histories of all of these acts, I'd really rather you take this album as a starter and move on from there, investigating the secret world of avant-prog to your heart's content. All you really need is the desire to jam, and maybe a slight fetish for grooves in 11.","Kroko are a Finnish band that plays progressive rock, and if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea ...

Somehow, Franky and I had made it to that sacred place where the lights are far too bright and the sound is far too loud. The excitement was palpable. Though the vast majority of the 10,000 or so people present was directly behind me, and well outside of my field of view, I could sense the size and excitement of the crowd around me. I turned to Franky, who stared in rapt attention at the stage, absolutely silent. Finally, the moment arrived. These five beings graced the stage like the gods of old descending from Olympus, illuminated by the fiery rays of Helios' chariot. The scene was as heavenly and beautiful as Jesus and Buddha playing handball on Jerry Garcia's assflab. The crowd's response was as loud and forceful as a tidal wave of live kittens. Yet, Franky remained silent. Finally, as the band prepared for their first song, he turned his head to me, his brown eyes shiny and round like a sheep turd soaked in glitter. Surely, he was aware that this was the single most magical moment of his life ever. Staring awestruck at the massive crowd behind my head, Franky opened his mouth slightly, prepared to speak. And the words he spoke, which seemed to flow straight from his soul like a leaky thermos of godly ambrosia, have remained with me to this day: ""Thom Yorke just got 10,000 people to pay $60 to stare at his ugly ass."" Sure enough, the audience seemed to be positively transfixed by the image of Yorke, his lazy eye dragging two or three centimeters behind him, twitching and wailing. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to equate the show to Radiohead's music itself-- big rock laced with intrigue, fragility, and ugliness. On I Might Be Wrong, a good deal of the essence of Radiohead's live show is distilled onto an eight-track EP. And while some moments are absolutely stellar, I Might Be Wrong is only a shadow of what a Radiohead live album could have been. Like most Radiohead shows, I Might Be Wrong opens with ""The National Anthem."" The song's introduction, with Thom Yorke breathing in staccato over Colin Greenwood's thunderous bassline and Jonny Greenwood's skillful manipulation of the primitive Ondes-Martenot, is absolutely wonderful. Without a horn section, though, the song never really develops as it does on Kid A, trailing off without a satisfying conclusion. ""The National Anthem"" is followed by ""I Might Be Wrong,"" a song that wouldn't be even remotely interesting in its live incarnation if not for the subtle shifts in dynamics that grace the middle and end of the song. ""Morning Bell,"" like ""The National Anthem,"" builds to a meandering ending. But it meanders with enough grace to keep it interesting, with Ed O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood working their trademark magic with effects-laden guitars and synthesizers. With ""Like Spinning Plates,"" I Might Be Wrong hits its stride. Recasting the song as a piano ballad with eerie synthesized strings, Radiohead turned one of Amnesiac's most cryptically brilliant tracks into something much more emotional and accessible without being at all sappy or manipulative. With this new version, the song's melody-- complete with the eerily, vaudevillian quality that inhabits it during the chorus-- takes center stage, showcasing Radiohead's songwriting virtuosity rather than their sonic adventurousness. ""Like Spinning Plates"" is followed by ""Idioteque"" and ""Everything in its Right Place,"" possibly the two finest tracks from Kid A, and certainly one of the better sections of this EP. The former succeeds in capturing the energy Yorke channels during live interpretations of the song, whereas the latter takes the aural experimentation of the album version one step further, with sublime digital manipulations building electronic tapestries of sound. After the schizophrenic meltdown of ""Idioteque"" and the catharsis of ""Everything in Its Right Place,"" an entirely unexceptional version of ""Dollars and Cents"" is more than a little bit of a letdown, as it lacks both momentum and innovation. But ""Dollars and Cents"" is followed by I Might Be Wrong's main attraction, the previously unreleased ""True Love Waits."" An acoustic outtake from the OK Computer era, ""True Love Waits"" is absolutely gorgeous. With signature unexpected chord changes and a melody that both aches and soothes, ""True Love Waits"" can hold its own against any song on OK Computer, and makes a very welcome ending to I Might Be Wrong. But while tracks like ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""True Love Waits"" certainly justify the existence of I Might Be Wrong, the EP seems purposely limited in a way that's immensely frustrating. At only eight songs, the disc is being sold and marketed (and priced) as a full-length album. Given the fact that so many shows were recorded in preparation for this EP, there's absolutely no reason that I Might Be Wrong should have been limited to eight tracks. Similarly frustrating is the fact that every single track here, aside from ""True Love Waits,"" is taken from either Kid A or Amnesiac. The inclusion of a live version of ""Fake Plastic Trees,"" ""Karma Police,"" or ""Just"" would have rounded off the record nicely. Sadly, one can't shake the feeling that this disc exists largely as a promotional item for Radiohead's last two albums. The quality of the recordings and performances on I Might Be Wrong is certainly top-notch. But Internet bootlegs-- most notably a soundboard recording from Nijmegen, a small city in Holland-- present a better, more complete picture of the Radiohead live experience. Still, even with better live documents available for free, it's hard to resist an officially sanctioned live EP with a few absolutely stellar tracks. And although I Might Be Wrong is obnoxiously incomplete, the fact remains that Thom Yorke just got 100,000 people to spend $17.99 for eight songs. Good for him.","The bright lights flashed in unison like cheap aluminum UFOs in a starless sky. My eyes convulsed in time with ...

The Heartfelt,Figurine,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd95c0084474cd0c2d25/1:1/w_160/46aec325.jpg,2001-12-17 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3054-the-heartfelt/,March,"In my dreams, I conceive of other worlds. This morning I dreamt of a world where everyone suffers from socially inhibiting phobias. I walked through a world where laughter was rare and where all bright colors had been snuffed out. How would the entertainment industry eke out a dollar when everyone's perpetually bummed? Here's a snippet of my vision: The lovelorn electro-pop trio Figurine will be a prominent sidebar to the cover story of the forthcoming seasonally affected disorder and related phobias issue of Tiger Beat. It's going to be a superb issue. The magazine will also give heart-wrenching accounts of Christina Aguilera's battle with trichotillomania and Joey Fatone's emergence from years of agoraphobic-induced knuckle-cracking. Pitchfork has been granted permission to exclusively reveal details of the Figurine sidebar. The three members of the band first discuss their reluctant fondness for the color yellow and their desire to paint a lushly red broken heart on every street corner, in order to promote what they tragically call ""the love."" James and Meredith Figurine are so afflicted by ""the love"" that they sing about it all the time-- and sometimes with something approaching conviction. Third wheel David has also experienced ""the love,"" but we're never really sure if David is cool with James' and Meredith's unceasing canoodling. This part of the article shows a photo of Meredith's locker in high school. Most of the inside of the door is covered in faded photos of her and James out at the beach, at the millpond, or slurping a shared food court smoothie. But if you look closely, beneath the photos, you can see partially ripped-off sticky labels that read, ""Merry has the love for Dave."" But the three are still friends. If David is still mad at his bandmates for hooking up and leaving him as permanent gooseberry, The Heartfelt doesn't show it. Unless that's David inserting raucous Belgium rave hoover sounds into the la-la-la's that James and Meredith exchange as billets-doux throughout the album. Maybe that's David, too, shredding the cooing couple's whispers with old-skool junglist breaks. When James and Meredith aren't being attacked by mutant rave elements, they lay out their faded quilt of 80s synth pop. No one will be surprised that Figurine have sewn the rinky-dinkness of Depeche Mode's Speak and Spell to the pompous austerity of OMD's Architecture and Morality, with threads of heavily blushed, Dare-era Human League. What's surprising is that the band's lyrics are-- with the charitable exception of the opening song, ""International Space Station II""-- woefully banal expositions on relationships not going perfectly. Rather than examining the root causes as to why these fictional relationships have collapsed into disappointment and recrimination, the band scrabbles for $4.99 paperback self-help platitudes and irritatingly weak singing. The album opener, ""International Space Station II,"" looks to \xB5-Ziq for its otherworldly ambience and to kindergarten for its percussion as James and Meredith discuss their long distance relationship across the solar system. ""Impossible"" tosses the innovations of the opener away with its fusion of the Euro dance-pop of La Bouche with Visage's synth pads. (And if you were wondering, the Belgian rave sound being dropped into this track is annoying, rather than disquieting.) For ""Rewind,"" Figurine try to emulate Four Tet's Pause. Above picked acoustic guitars and Roland TB-303 squelches and stabs, James sings, ""Every single move you make/ Ends up being a big mistake/ You constantly embarrass me/ In front of friends and family."" Despite these shortcomings, James thinks that, with a judicious rewind, things could be made right. Yaz and Depeche Mode founder Vince Clarke should have been given a writing credit for ""Our Game,"" which borrows liberally from Clarke's pioneering, two-finger keyboard style. Unfortunately, Meredith doesn't attempt to emulate Alison Moyet's bluesy power. Instead, as on the rest of The Heartfelt, her voice is paltry and characterless. Figurine redeem the track halfway through, however. Like the old Studio 1 releases that segued from the vocal to the dub version, so does ""Our Game"" launch into its remix version with glistening glee. Without lacing The Heartfelt with the anxiety of Fad Gadgett, Lali Puna's pop contortions, or the retro futurist panache of Ladytron, Figurine slump into being just another band who are competent at recreating music to wear too much make-up to. And that, my friends, is frustrating, because I know members of this band are capable of outstanding work. The core of Figurine is Dntel's James Tamborello, whose Life is Full of Possibilities LP is the most creative and provocative statement I've heard this year. But where Life is Full of Possibilities takes risks and subverts, The Heartfelt is simple and unremarkably dour. If this is how Figurine define ""heartfelt,"" they'll learn much from Seventeen's forthcoming article on defeating low self-esteem and underachievement.","In my dreams, I conceive of other worlds.

"Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt",Andrew Coleman,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a620ea9e61561daa52cf/1:1/w_160/f7210372.jpg,2001-12-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1543-everything-was-beautiful-and-nothing-hurt/,Thrill Jockey,"Those choke-hazard tchotchkes Animals on Wheels no longer fascinate Andrew Coleman. Drill-n-bass has lost its appeal, too, over the years. Thus, Coleman has abandoned his former alias and style and is all the better for the switch. As Animals on Wheels, Coleman gave the world two albums of breakbeat encrusted noise, and as such, sat on the fringes of the Ninja Tune roster. Now recording for Thrill Jockey, Coleman finds himself comfortable, his avant-leaning precocity embraced by the label that also writes royalty checks for Mouse on Mars, Nobukazu Takemura, and Oval. Though trading in the frenetic energy of his Animals on Wheels' releases, Coleman is still pursuing juxtapositions. Whereas Animals on Wheels' Designs and Mistakes, and its less frantic successor, Nuvol I Cadira, sought to contrast wounding shards of breakbeats with warm fuzzy melodies, Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt looks for clashes between elegance and distortion. These distortions, created with antiquated 16-bit equipment and soundcards, imbue Coleman's gorgeous melodies with an aliased corona that works in harmony with the very appropriate title that Coleman has chosen for this collection. Emerging from low frequency waves, ""Too Early By Far"" pits white noise against a harmonium drone and a piano melody. Despite the white noise gathering supporters from the clapped-out percussion synth Coleman uses, the exuberant piano melody excels and is greeted at the end by a honking bass clarinet. ""Pi Four"" finds Coleman's piano trading lines with a frazzled, piercing, possibly guitar-in-origin figure, while a Boards of Canada-style rhythm ensures that all punches are above the belt. The crazy calliope of ""Escalator Apartment"" wrestles with a Nuvol I Cadira-ish breakbeat clatter. The Bucephalus Bouncing Ball melody and cracked percussion of ""Plot Lost Sixteen"" take me back to agitated Sunday afternoons, apparently lazy, but in fact fraught with nascent nastiness. ""Vocational Shouter"" recalls Aphex Twin's fuzzy masterpiece, ""Tha,"" with its anchorless, sinewy chords grasping for just a moment's coherence. ""Hang Up Season"" carries on the approximation of sense begun with ""Vocational Shouter."" About the exerting synthline, shrill lines force their way in and out of the background like the angels of death from Raiders of the Lost Ark. During ""Wider Ignorance,"" Coleman subverts a routine downtempo drum pattern by sideswiping it with electronic piano chords and a melody borrowed from Salvador Dali's mother's musical jewelry box. Closing the album with the spacious-but-weighty ""Curse of Knowing"" Coleman proves one final time that he's as fascinating a pianist as he is a drum machine operator. With Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt, Andrew Coleman has accomplished the fusion of avant-garde electronics and poetic pianism. Coleman serenely succeeds where Richard D. James' Drukqs faltered: Coleman wasn't faking when he came up with his album title.","Those choke-hazard tchotchkes Animals on Wheels no longer fascinate Andrew Coleman.

Listen to What the Man Said: Popular Artists Pay Tribute to the Music of Paul McCartney,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fb69fc7814a47cd79d/1:1/w_160/289bc72d.gif,2001-12-16 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5177-listen-to-what-the-man-said-popular-artists-pay-tribute-to-the-music-of-paul-mccartney/,Oglio,"Alright, I already feel bad about this. This is due to the fact that this disc and its companion (Coming Up: Independent Artists Pay Tribute to the Music of Paul McCartney) are actually designed to bring in money for breast cancer charities. My brain's moral police are trying to get some sort of injunction forcing me to endorse the disc, but as a music fan, I can't quite bring myself to do it. After all, it's not my job to be some sort of social evangelist here; I'm just supposed to review the album and tell you whether or not the music on it is any good. On with it, then. First, let's establish that there aren't any Beatles songs on here-- only solo Paul (or Wings, which I will also refer to as ""solo Paul,"" for obvious reasons). Opinions vary widely on just how essential Sir McCartney's post-greatest-band-of-all-time output is, but few can deny that there are definitely a few corkers floating through his discography. He's certainly the most commercially successful of the former Beatles, too, and given the sheer volume of material available, it only seems right that he should receive some sort of tribute in his honor. A few of the selections here manage to do clever things with their respective originals, and all of the readings at least reflect a genuine admiration for the source material. However, most ultimately end up rehashing Macca's own performances while adding little to nothing in the process. In order to give you a detailed look at just what Listen to What the Man Said has to offer you, here's a track-by-track breakdown of the whole thing: 1.Owsley: ""Band on the Run."" Damn. This guy used to play backup for Shania Twain and Amy Grant. He opens the disc with a version of ""Band on the Run"" that, at a low enough volume, could easily be mistaken for the original. This is one of Paul's best solo songs, and given its linear composition, it would be intimidating to try and rearrange it significantly, but this is just ridiculous. Every single note is exactly the same, and most of the instrument sounds are approximate to the originals. Really, you might as well just listen McCartney's. 2.SR-71: ""My Brave Face."" So, it's been established that punk is never really going to die, but couldn't pop/punk die in its place? Please? I'd also complain about bands with numbers in their names, but these guys are at least named for a cool spy plane. Regardless, these guys turn in a standard pop/punk version of ""My Brave Face"" that you just don't need to hear. 3.Kevin Hearn, Steven Page and Stephen Duffy: ""Junk."" So that's two guys from the Barenaked Ladies, and one guy from the Lilac Time. Their version of McCartney's ""Junk"" is, surprisingly, one of the most satisfying songs on this album, pumping the minimally arranged original full of carnivalesque atmosphere with the addition of some accordion-like keyboards. It's a waltz through a slightly cracked world of childhood memories that doesn't get old even after several listens. And, of course, the original is one of Paul's greatest solo songs-- having good source material never hurt anyone. 4.Semisonic: ""Jet."" Another ultra-faithful, fairly pointless cover that adds virtually nothing to the original. In fact, it takes out the orchestra, and vocalist Dan Wilson's pipes are barely up to the task of singing the melody. I had a really good joke about ""Closing Time"" to use here about an hour ago, but I forgot it during dinner. At any rate, there's really no reason for this recording to exist when, again, you could just listen to the original, which is basically identical, except for the superior performance. 5.The Merrymakers: ""No More Lonely Nights."" Unless you were desperately seeking a band whose entire sound is indebted to Graham Nash's ""Our House"" and sitcom themes, there's not a whole lot of merrymaking going on here. Truth be told, the band actually improves a little on the original, which is one of my least favorite McCartney songs. The original is fairly cornball, and the Merrymakers nix the gratuitously long guitar solo sections, while instilling the song with a more modern loud/soft chorus/verse dynamic. In the end, it's a pretty faithful cover of one of McCarntey's lesser songs with a slightly more modern feel, and a wholly unnecessary one at that. 6.Robyn Hitchcock: ""Let Me Roll It."" The most baffling thing about this selection is the fact that it's not credited to the Soft Boys, as it should be. Hitchcock is joined by Windsor, Rew, and Seligman on a cover of possibly the most Lennon-esque song McCartney ever wrote (""Helter Skelter"" notwithstanding). They do a fine job of it as well, but it suffers from the same affliction that a lot of the other tracks here do: not enough imagination. It's basically a faithful run-through, and I frankly expected a little more from the man who gave us ""I Want to Be an Anglepoise Lamp"" and ""Sandra's Having Her Brain Out."" Still, it's an entertaining listen, and there are subtle psychedelic flourishes that make it worthwhile. 7.The Finn Brothers: ""Too Many People."" Late of Split Enz and Crowded House, the Finn Brothers offer an upbeat, tight version of ""Too Many People,"" which wasn't really terribly good in its original form. This version manages to capture Paul's excellent bassline perfectly, but Denny Laine's fine guitar part loses some of its impact on the cover. Once again, it would have been nice if the duo hadn't been afraid to bring something uniquely their own to the song. 8.The Minus 5: ""Dear Friend."" Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey get props for choosing an obscurity from Wild Life, one of McCartney's rawest, oddest solo albums. They do a great job with it, too, capturing the original's wrecked, sad ambiance with aplomb. Harpsichords march solemnly in the background while e-bowed guitars sing in sympathy with the song's protagonist, whom McCaughey ably plays. Paul's quiet response to John's ""How Do You Sleep?"" hasn't sounded this good since he recorded it himself back in 1971. 9.Matthew Sweet: ""Every Night"" Um, once again, points off for lack of imagination. Sweet keeps it simple and his version works well enough, but it feels a lot like a runthrough that didn't require a lot of thought. That said, it's quite affecting when Sweet's gruff voice takes on the wordless vocals at the end of the song. 10.Sloan: ""Waterfalls."" Contrary to popular belief, the Beatles of the Great White North is not Klaatu, it's Sloan. So who better to cover a Paul McCartney tune than four guys who've made their career writing songs that play heir to his legacy? Well, no one does it better on this disc. Halifax's finest offer a significantly energized take on McCartney's elegiac original, and it works beautifully. Silk-throated singer Jay Ferguson himself writes in the liner notes that he felt the best way to go about doing a McCartney cover was to pick a song that you could make your own, rather than simply copying the original. If only the rest of the bands on this compilation had used as much imagination. 11.World Party: ""Man We Was Lonely."" I've always thought that if the Beatles had stayed together through 1970, ""Man We Was Lonely"" would have been the obligatory Ringo vocal on the follow-up to Let It Be, with its bounding feel and sing-song chorus. World Party's Karl Wallinger plays it straight here, which means it's enjoyable to listen to, but also, once again, nearly identical to the original. 12.John Faye Power Trip: ""Coming Up."" The John Faye Power Trip, aside from having an excellent bandname, manage to pay tribute here not only to Sir Paul, but also the late George Harrison, nicking the bassline from ""Taxman"" and inserting it slightly altered into a nicely reworked version of one of McCartney's few attempts at getting funky. The result is one of the most enjoyable and unique tracks on the disc, and one of the few songs that feels more like homage than imitation. 13.Virgos: ""Maybe I'm Amazed."" Pretty much all that's different about this version of ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" is that the piano part of the original has been replaced by a guitar playing the same thing. It's basically ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" filtered through the lens of radio-ready modern rock with a slight glam edge added. Vocalist Brett Hesla does an admirable job of hitting the high notes, but there's not nearly enough to distinguish this version from McCartney's version. 14.Judybats: ""Love in Song."" A footnote of early-90s alternative rock, the Judybats come out from the rock they've been hiding under since people stopped caring to offer a psychedelic version of Venus & Mars' ""Love in Song."" Paul's version stands as one of his creepiest, loneliest songs, and the Judybats trade in that atmosphere for modern crunch and a more aggressive approach. It's not better than the original by any means, but it's one of the most thoughtful reimaginings present, and it deserves points just for that. 15.Linus of Hollywood: ""Warm and Beautiful."" McCartney as easy-listening vocal jazz. Linus performs a capella, layering his voice in the background to provide rhythms. I don't deny the man's vocal skill or passion, but this blows harder than a level three hurricane. Shut up, Linus. 16.They Might Be Giants: ""Ram On."" With the possible exception of our friend Linus, this is the most bizarre offering on the disc. The Johns choose to ditch the vocals entirely, instead coming up with a hodgepodge instrumental tribute. It actually touches nicely on the spirit of the original, which was fairly strange and dubby to begin with. It closes the disc on a whimsical note that's lacking from a large portion of what comes before it, too, so it feels exceptionally well-placed. And there you have it. The main problem with this disc is that most of the artists simply don't do enough with the songs they're using to make it interesting. The enthusiasm of each artist is evident from the liner notes, and most of it's not horrible, but it still feels less than necessary. But then, there's the fact that it was all done for a charitable cause. Of course, the best intentions can't mask a sub-par product, which is what this is. Is Listen to What the Man Said worth your time? Eh, probably not, unless you're an unbelievably huge Paul McCartney fan. But is its cause worth your money? Just donate $15 and call it a day.","Alright, I already feel bad about this. This is due to the fact that this disc and its companion (Coming ...

Moldy Peaches,The Moldy Peaches,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38d69fc7814a47cd689/1:1/w_160/f8478fe8.jpg,2001-12-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5382-moldy-peaches/,Sanctuary,"The Manichean conception of the rock history says that, in the beginning, there was chaos, a turbulent cesspool of pop culture that fed off and eroded the genteel traditions of Western culture. From this confusion and formlessness rose the prophet Zappa, uniting the sublime and the absurd amid arching guitar solos, holy hosannas des latrines de Chartres. From there, it pretty much boils down to so-and-so begot so-and-so, with certain offspring taking the high road while others took the low. Bands like Sonic Youth and Pavement built their names and legacies on aspiring to the highbrow camp, their reputations gradually gaining momentum until the achievement of Canonical Indie Rock status. And then there's the Moldy Peaches, the musical equivalent of the pull-my-finger gag, who prefer references to blowjobs and buttholes over Mark E. Smith and John Cage. Kimya Dawson and Adam Green are the Sonny and Cher of post-millennial toilet humor. But, still subscribing to the slacker ethos of mid-90s college dropouts, Dawson offers a bipolar, type-a confusion in lieu of Cher's wide-eyed, free-love naivete. She's as likely to sit bleary-eyed in front of a ""Scooby Doo"" cartoon as she is to dream of clawing out the eyes of the prom queen. And standing in for the awkward ""I can't believe I scored this piece of ass"" straightman, Green fulfills Sonny's role with a more updated ""thank god I've got this genuinely cool chick who'd like to claw out the eyes of the prom queen"" schtick. The Moldy Peaches' sound is as lo-fi as imaginably possible. The first seven of these 22 tracks are unpredictable, hilarious and, despite the sloppy, couldn't-give-a-shit delivery, the songwriting is really pretty good for a couple of bedroom wanna-be-Beat-Happenings with a four-track. Of course, it's hard to keep this kind of thing up for long, and things eventually start to go down the crapper (as it were). The rest of the album ranges from the whimsical acoustic musings of ""Jorge Regula"" and ""Anyone Else But You"" to the manic ""What Went Wrong"" and ""Greyhound Bus."" There are touching moments, sure: the kooky heartbreak of ""Nothing Came Out"" (""Without forty ounces of social skills/ I'm just an ass in the crack of humanity/ I'm just a huge manatee"") that somehow mixes in references to G.I. Joe, Ron Jeremy and He-Man. There's the irresistible, mind-in-the-gutter boogie of ""Downloading Porn with Dave,"" sounding like a road trip down Route 66 with Hunter Thompson and Linda Lovelace (""Sleepin' in a van between A & B/ Suckin' dick for ecstasy""). There's the tripped-out spookiness of ""These Burgers."" But for every hit, there's an ass in the crack of humanity. Witness the wack b-boy embarrassment of ""On Top,"" or the asinine pep-talk to blooming geeks everywhere, ""D.2. Boyfriend."" It's not a pretty thing. One thing the Moldy Peaches have going for them is their utter lack of pretense. It makes it difficult to criticize because, despite its terrible unevenness, what you hear is exactly what they intended. Also, the fun that was obviously had during the recording session is infectious-- there are moments when Dawson and Green are trying as hard as they can not to bust a nut laughing. And while childish, things like this enhance the replay value. It remains to be seen whether the Moldy Peaches can reproduce their achievement here, or whether we really want them to. But I can see the duo as the one of those unexplained groups that disappear as soon as they've arrived and cascade through the years as a cult favorite. And for all of us who feel like we grew up trapped in a Todd Solondz script, we've found ourselves a couple of friends for our damaged inner child.","The Manichean conception of the rock history says that, in the beginning, there was chaos, a turbulent cesspool of pop ...

This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic EP,Minus the Bear,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5565e6ef95969323ac0/1:1/w_160/a8c4296a.gif,2001-12-16 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5323-this-is-what-i-know-about-being-gigantic-ep/,Suicide SqueezeSuicide Squeeze,"Excuses, excuses, excuses. Last year, while interning at Social Services somewhere in rural, truly ass-backwards Virginia, I ran across the case of a client-- we'll call him the Deer Hunter-- who I thought needed a good one (excuse, that is). As they say, ""Virginia is for Lovers."" In this case, the Deer Hunter was in love with two things: hunting and humping. Police learned that the hard way, discovering him outdoors in flagrante delicto with Bambi. I'm not talking a hooker, either. I'm talking a deer. A fresh kill, as it were. And a fresh ""conquest,"" I might add. Considering Virginia's Criminal Code, which outlaws sodomy, cohabitation, and all sex acts between unmarried persons, one would think that the Old Dominion would have made room for necrobestiality. But one would think wrong. The Deer Hunter needed no excuse for his carnal passions-- deer-scrumping is punishable in a court of law only if the animal is still living. Dead animals are fair game. Somewhere in Virginia, shotguns are being loaded. Minus the Bear, a quintet from the northwest comprised of members of Botch, Kill Sadie and Sharks Keep Moving, have more in common with the Deer Hunter than they might like to think. For one thing, just as the Deer Hunter needed no excuse to ride, Minus the Bear needs absolutely no excuse to rock. But who ever did? It is no crime to rock. So, without shame, Minus the Bear charges forth, imbuing their debut seven-track EP, This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic, with fervent rock energy. This is not, however, your ordinary missionary-style rock and roll. Consider again the Deer Hunter; one can hardly blame the guy-- his kids were probably growing older, losing their sex appeal with each passing day. So, instead of letting life control him, he grabbed it by the antlers. Call it perverted, call it resourceful, call it what you will. But one thing is certain: the man was creative. Like Jed, Minus the Bear are innovators. No strumming or chunking here; axe-man David Knudson drives the band with fluid, catchy, tapped riffs. The bright, focused guitar tone is a trademark of Minus the Bear's sound. Another twist is the band's electronic elements: noises whisper, hover, and gurgle in the background, adding depth and richness to the mix. The drums are propulsive and complementary, jumping with the same energy as the guitars. Erin Tate is an active drummer, frequently adding firm tom and snare fills. Bassist Cory Murchy, who with Tate make up Kill Sadie's rhythm section, has a great time and a great ear; his basslines lock solidly with the other rhythm elements, while providing tasteful harmony. Vocals, courtesy of Jake Snider, are infrequent but appropriate; they act more like a fifth musical element than a song's centerpiece. Minus the Bear's song structures are equally as creative, going the prog/math-rock route in pursuit of unexpected bridges, rhythmic dynamics and time signatures. The opening track, amusingly titled, ""Hey, Wanna Throw Up? Get Me Naked,"" is a great example. It lifts-off with a cleanly tapped riff, then cuts to power-rock for the chorus, and weaves in and out of a fuzzy, waltzing bassline and gurgling synth to close. The album's finale, ""Pantsuit.Uggghhh,"" drones for two minutes before a jagged guitar riffs intrudes and adds tempo. Snider repeats the chorus, ""No one sleeps yet/ Let's keep it going til the morning,"" while Knudson merges into a characteristic tapping, contrasted by intermittent bass jabs. Unconventional but catchy as all hell. The Deer Hunter needed no excuse. Minus the Bear needs no excuse. Add another to the list: you. You need absolutely no excuse to add Minus the Bear to your CD collection. Any group this tight and proficient on their first recording undoubtedly has much more to say. And at the price of an EP, This Is What I Know is about as cheap as a walk in the woods.","Excuses, excuses, excuses.

James William Hindle,James William Hindle,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0e713d197565213baf4/1:1/w_160/c6dbb171.jpg,2001-12-13 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3873-james-william-hindle/,Badman,"Hey, you like Nick Drake, right? I know you do. Just about everyone does these days it seems. Maybe you even liked him before it was cool-- back before his songs weren't advertising for Volkswagen. At any rate, if you're into the sad Englishman, you'll probably want to check out this James Hindle album. First, let's give the guy some credit here. James Hindle doesn't really sound like Nick Drake-- his voice is deeper, his diction is better, and his arrangements are a little less exploratory-- but he comes from the same English folk tradition that gave rise to Drake and scores of his contemporaries. Born in Yorkshire, he made the move to London like a lot of great musicians eventually do, packing an acoustic guitar and a set of expertly penned tunes to show off around town. To record his debut album, though, he made the trek from the foggy streets of London to the foggy hills of San Francisco, and it shows a little. The sound here falls somewhere between that of Hindle's countrymen and Bay Area locals the Red House Painters. There's an even more formal connection between the two than sound, though. Producer and Badman founder Dylan Magierek is also responsible for the sound on head House Painter Mark Kozelek's two recent solo albums, and the atmosphere on James William Hindle is similarly dry and unaffected. Hindle opens his debut with the steadily waltzing ""Down and Able,"" accompanying his midrange tenor with big, slowly strummed chords and loping arpeggios. Former American Music Club skinsman Tim Mooney provides a stately pulse as Hindle transfers his heart from his ribs to his sleeve with lines like, ""Four weeks seems endless when you're stuck in the first one/ And it's four in the morning/ It feels like the light will never come/ And I feel disastrous with all of my follies/ The usual misgivings and dangers."" ""Remember My Markings"" adds a thoughtfully scored string quartet to the same basic formula, except this time, there's an even better melody for them to interact with. The swelling cello and violin countermelodies trade off nicely with Hindle's vocal, culminating in one of the record's high points when Hindle is joined by former Tarnation vocalist Paula Frazer on the song's jaw-dropping bridge. Hindle's voice and the strings are all you get on ""(Masks),"" which gives the song a rather stunning sense of loneliness. It's followed by what may be Hindle's best original, ""The List of You and Me."" The tempo is up a few notches as he declares, ""These are the days of our imperfection and this is where I feel at home,"" in the chorus over Dirty Three-inspired electric guitar-grind and layers of vigorously bowed violins. Nearly as good is the song that follows-- ""Brooklyn Song"" is a spare track featuring Hindle and his guitar backed only by a thick, brooding cello line. It wouldn't be too out of place on Five Leaves Left, if you had to know the truth. Alongside all the originals are two inspired covers: a sufficiently twangy take on Glen Campbell's ""Less of Me,"" which closes out the set, and the true stunner, a remarkably personal version of the Bee Gees' ""I Started a Joke."" Hindle does for the brothers Gibb here what Mark Kozelek has done for AC/DC time and again, stripping away the pretense and posturing of the original and laying the lyrics and basic melody bare. The result is a deeply sad, but not depressing, moment of quiet reflection. If there's a criticism to level at James Hindle at this point, it's that he needs to work a little on developing his vocal delivery and expanding the range of his material slightly. A few more songs would also be nice, as the album clocks in a little short at thirty-five minutes and eight tracks. Still, for a nascent artist, Hindle's craft is quite well-formed and it seems as though he can only go up from here. With any luck at all, he's destined to release some great records in the future. Who knows? Maybe twenty years from now, your kids will find out about him from some Volkswagen ad. Here's hoping the future will be a bit kinder.","Hey, you like Nick Drake, right? I know you do.

Lull Some Piano,Howe Gelb,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf03abf31b7dc7156235/1:1/w_160/f907100d.gif,2001-12-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3416-lull-some-piano/,Ow Om,"Some cynical souls might say success has gone to Howe Gelb's head like so much peyote. After more than 20 years in the biz, often dismissed as a poor-man's Meat Puppets, Gelb's Giant Sand finally scored a critical breakthrough with 2000's Chore of Enchantment. Not many bands set a new high water mark for themselves with their eleventh album, but that's exactly what Gelb & Co. did with their Neil Young-ish collection of desert hymns and ambient folkscapes. So what does he do next? Well, first he releases a fractured collection of oddball tracks and after-show parking lot recordings called Confluence, which, like most of the Gelb/Giant Sand discography, is hit or miss at best-- the kind of album you listen to a few times through, then put on the shelf and wait for a few others like it to float through your transom before you burn your own ""best of"" compilation. Now, a few scant months later, along comes Lull Some Piano, a collection of 19 (mostly) solo piano compositions. Recorded at various locations, with some dating back as far as 1988, these songs are almost completely devoid of lyrics. Giant Sand bandmates Joe Burns and John Convertino (better known to some as Calexico) turn up on a few numbers, as do some samples and loops, but the vast majority of Lull is just Howe, 88 keys, and a box. And David Helfgott he ain't, but Howe plays better than most people probably expect. Given his fiery guitar work and corny sense of humor, I might have expected something more... I don't know, avant or experimental sounding, or at least something that would make me immediately wonder what he was thinking. Instead, Gelb keeps it nice and harmonic and proper, creating the kind of music you might play at a dinner party, which I guess is kind of risky in its own way. Gelb stays away from jazz or barrelhouse blues, preferring to stay in the classically influenced realm with a few diversions into Kurt Weill territory and that of movie soundtracks. In the end, I ended up asking myself anyway: ""what was he thinking?"" Now, sure, it's possible that Lull Some Piano is just a case of ol' Howe capitalizing on his recent upswing in visibility. After all, he has almost attained indie rock ""elder statesman"" status by now, so he can dish out a collection of scraps and be virtually guaranteed that a relatively sizable audience will lap it up dutifully. But it should be noted that all Gelb/Giant Sand releases over the last decade have been scraps collections at their core: Howe and his buddies hang out in their homes and studios, mess with their instruments till the sun goes down (or comes up), and then sift through the reels and see what's there. With Chore of Enchantment, they just happened to strike gold. So, at the very least, you can't accuse the man of compromising his vision in the face of wide(r) acclaim. But that said, Lull Some Piano is surely for diehard Sandheads only. Or maybe for fans of the burgeoning indie rock dinner party scene.","Some cynical souls might say success has gone to Howe Gelb's head like so much peyote. After more than ...

Pärson Sound,Pärson Sound,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fff5e6ef9596931fe60/1:1/w_160/6def23a0.gif,2001-12-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6180-parson-sound/,Subliminal SoundsTi'llindien,"I might as well go ahead and divulge a tidbit or two upfront: Pärson Sound is a musical outfit with Swedish origins and a predilection for psychedelia. Depending on the take, it's a concoction capable of sending you on a run to the nearest exit or reaching for the knob to crank the volume. What's more, prior to this year, the majority of the music world had never heard the name, much less encountered any of the music. Hence, a little rundown is in order: For a brief period during 1967-68, Pärson Sound was a frontrunner in the burgeoning Swedish music scene, leading to a few shows accompanying Terry Riley, an opening gig for the Doors and an invite from Andy Warhol to play an art exhibit in Stockholm. Regrettably, no album was ever cut and the band's activity ended almost as soon as it began-- although later manifestations would emerge and continue under the names Harvester (sometimes known as International Harvester) and Träd, Gräs och Stenar (translation: Trees, Grass and Stones). Up until this recent release, Pärson Sound was basically just a blip on a musical roadmap, their name appearing sparingly in Warhol articles or Swedish musical histories. So I'll let you in on a little secret. As January rapidly approaches, I can say this two-disc set is by far the most unexpected surprise of the year. Serving up a platter of archival recordings (rehearsals, studio and live cuts), this Pärson Sound collection is drug-addled psychedelic mindfuckery at its best. And that's just the beginning. Successfully marrying the ideas of rock, jazz, and drone experimentalism, this Swedish quintet sounds like it wasn't just trying to break free of the limitations inherent in each genre; at times, it sounds like they were trying to blow the doors off the hinges. Opening the first disc, ""Tio Minuter"" (""Ten Minutes"") starts out quietly enough, beginning with a hushed guitar atop distant vocal chants. Don't let it fool you. It's a ruse. One minute in, the band forsakes the mesmerizing guitar for an intense, cacophonous clamor. Sounding as if someone suddenly set the stage on fire, Pärson Sound unleashes a grinding series of brutal guitar riffs. Stretching out beyond ten minutes, the band isn't content to remain in one sound territory. The track builds from a mammoth sludge-fest into a ringing guitar drone backed by the screeching sounds of Arne Ericsson sawing away at his electric-cello. Everything settles into a glacial pace near the end as the sounds of ghostly tape-lagged voices glide over each other, an invocation for the ether-regions (which makes sense-- séance is a credited instrument in the liner notes). The blissed-out trance work continues with ""From Tunis to India in Fullmoon (On Testosterone),"" a miasmic sound orgy that drips with ecstatic energy. It's a Bacchanalian noise festival, an acid-drenched lunar ride in which everyone is whipped into rapturous primal frenzy while Pan taps his hoof and bleats out the age-old hypnotic spell. Driving forward into free-jazz, ""Tunis"" finds Pärson Sound openly and aggressively exploring ideas through improvisation. The entire track is a swirling sound-world, held fast by Thomas Mera Gartz's pounding percussion. Guitarists Bo Anders Persson and Ericsson immerse themselves in locked drones, enticing out a series of resonating vibrations, while saxophonist Thomas Tidholm reels off a series of rasping moans and pain-filled squeals. Coalescing into a tight-knit entity near the end, Persson hammers out a delirious buzzsaw solo over the increasing urgency of Gartz's percussion. The resulting din is pure astrophysical beauty. ""A Glimpse Inside the Glyptotec-66"" leaves the instruments behind, abandoning them for tape-looped guitar and Persson's lagged-voice experiments. Recorded for 1966's Young Nordic Music Festival, ""Glimpse"" is a surprisingly early collage for guitar and voice that places Persson alongside contemporary minimalists Terry Riley and Steve Reich. Having captured several glittering guitar drones and sequencing them on tape, he slowly adds pre-recorded tapes of voice mixed with his live moans and vocalized syllables. ""One Quiet Afternoon (In the King's Garden)"" is a massive squall of noise. Again toying with pre-recorded tape experiments, Pärson Sound creeps along, drowning everything in a rumbling clatter (much of it produced from the feedback-saturated tapes). Howling, pre-recorded voices amble over each other while the tapes are either accelerated to furious speeds or slowed to a dazed crawl. The second disc in the set both opens and closes with nascent versions of songs that would appear later on International Harvester's debut. Stretching to thirteen minutes, ""Sov Gott Rose-Marie"" is centered on a reverie-inducing guitar solo, but builds gradually into a frightening full-band chant of the title. With three members repeatedly intoning the title phrase, other instruments begin to pile up, climbing over each other and saturating the space. The result is a haunting, claustrophobic grumble filled with battered organ keys, pummeled bass strings and the fading remains of an earlier guitar drone. A track that starts with smoldering embers, ""Milano,"" moves at an increasingly rapid piece as time elapses and Pärson Sound stoke the fire. Subsumed within the booming percussion and electrically charged cello, Persson leisurely constructs a guitar solo that moves swiftly from rattling mess to drifting murmur. Moving in a recurring pattern, Persson's guitar workouts are sprawling meditative journeys-- shifting repetition often giving way to gradual movement and pulsing breath. With only five tracks per disc, the average length of each song is easily ten minutes or more, occasional stretching to the half-hour mark (the lengthy spiritualistic drone ""Skrubba"") and once or twice staying in the seven-minute range (the acoustic ""On How to Live""). In spite of this, any concerns related to length tend to dissipate once your head is fully submerged in the band's constantly inventive surroundings. During their brief stint, Pärson Sound had a rallying cry of ""We, Here and Now!"" that embraced their musical philosophy of a defragmented universal language. The time elapsed since their active years have seen a number of acts such as Amon Düül, Acid Mothers Temple, Bardo Pond and Taj Mahal Travelers traverse the same paths, garnishing accolades and international success. For a fan of any of these bands, or anyone fascinated by psychedelic, acid-blasted madness, this is ground zero.","I might as well go ahead and divulge a tidbit or two upfront: P\xE4rson Sound is a\n\ musical ...

Sweet Heart Fever,Scout Niblett,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f2ea9e61561daa8034/1:1/w_160/19675ff5.jpg,2001-12-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5785-sweet-heart-fever/,Secretly Canadian,"It's hard to believe that Emma Louise Niblett, otherwise known as Scout, is from Nottingham, England. There's not a trace of British accent anywhere on her debut album, Sweet Heart Fever. I have a suspicion that she's the reincarnation of a Louisiana bayou blues songstress, reborn to tell her tales of love and desire. There's more than a hint of southern American twang in each of these fourteen songs, and her guitar seems as apt at spinning yarns as jangling out these folky tunes. On first listen, Niblett may seem overly precocious. ""So Much Love to Do"" bounces along merrily on the upstroke of her guitar. ""It's comin' after me, 'cause I'm comin' after you,"" she sings, drawing out the notes in a cutesy crescendo. But then she places a nice, ominous pause between ""there's so much love"" and ""to do,"" which she sings falteringly. This hint of hesitance carries on through most of her work. ""Miss My Lion"" begins with an intense Zeppelin-esque riff, then breaks down into subtle strumming. Her plaintive cry contrasts well with the whimsical lyrics: ""When we get home, it'll be like a party/ See how we move, sunlit and playful."" Then the song shifts to aggressive pickwork again and her voice loses all restraint: ""When you drive, there's no fooling me/ Those roads invited me."" Niblett's voice can pierce the high register almost painfully, but more often, she remains somewhere between girlish warble and sultry waver. The production work is immediate, bringing the sounds of her guitar to the forefront, and yet, her songs retain a certain mystique. She's joined on some tracks by drummer Kristian Goddard. The lilting groove created by her chords and his bass drum on ""The Dance of Sulphur"" adds to the mystery in her lyrics: ""I felt something guarding me, as I entered the country..."" You could call Niblett's lyricism ""mysterious,"" but at times, she plain doesn't make sense. That song goes on to mention something about ""falling over constantly,"" psychic moles (?!) and ""where the wild things rest,"" as far as I can tell. Other lyrics confess that ""Neptune's in transit"" and ""trampling action causes me upsets."" Niblett's ability to transform her simple instrumental setup into a unique patchwork of emotion and imagery is impressive, but the resulting impressionist canvas might be annoying to some in its fussy level of self-concern. It's like the nervous manifestation of fever dreams on a long, hot summer night. Still, Niblett hits home more often than not. On ""Wet Road,"" there's no mistaking the shivering tension in her voice, barely containing some unnamable desire as she sings, ""Wet road, paradise, wet roads today/ On the way to your house again."" She goes on to chide like a young Bessie Smith: ""Don't ya know just to play with what you're given?"" And the straightforward Kinks-esque guitar and Appalachian drum stomp on ""Big Bad Man"" is great: ""Big Bad Man, lives all alone in the blue hills/ Everyone seems so scared of you/ I'm gonna cook you some real food!"" I admit, I was put off at first by Niblett's raw voice-- I'm not much for folky singer-songwriters. But Niblett won me over with the last few songs, especially ""Ground Breaking Service,"" in which the funereal subject matter is set off against a surreal series of notes, eerily just out of tune. The songwriting on these last few pieces matches the contrast between ""sweet"" and ""fevered"" suggested in the album title; my only suspicion is that Niblett is capable of greater work than this. So I'm curious to see if she'll continue to sketch like this on the sidelines, or if we can expect a fuller portrait from the artist in the future.","It's hard to believe that Emma Louise Niblett, otherwise known as Scout, is from Nottingham, England.

Bloodshot Eyes,Haymarket Riot,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c086c0084474cd0c31d5/1:1/w_160/bde5febb.gif,2001-12-12 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3779-bloodshot-eyes/,Thick,"Any band that names itself after a famous event in history understands that the majority of its reviews will begin with a summary of that event. But those who know anything about the actual Haymarket Riot of 1886 know that such predictability would not be in keeping with its spirit. After all, it was supposedly anarchists who really got the party started at the Haymarket, Illinois labor protest, tossing a bomb into a group of policemen and killing seven of them (though some reports blame the police). In memoriam, we'll postpone the summary for later and get right down to labor... er, business. Haymarket Riot, not surprisingly, hail from Chicago, Illinois. The quartet has an aggressive sound, dominated by two elements: shrill guitars, which attempt their fair share of angular counterpoint, and the treble attack of the bass tone, molded into kinetic, choppy basslines. Every member of the quartet contributes on vocals; the band often employs a ""team shouting"" approach, with an occasional melody line mixed in for contrast (they've drawn comparisons to Fugazi, for good reason). As a package, the Haymarket Riot sound is forceful, disquieted, and genuinely intense. The success of Haymarket Riot's song structures sink or swim with the effectiveness of the guitar/bass interplay. You find this a lot with bands that use the Riot's favored tones and textures. Independent of one another, the elements can sound pretty obnoxious. It's when the band hits on an equilibrium that they balance and perfect the approach. And when that happens, they achieve a sound both fierce and compelling. Unfortunately for Haymarket Riot, they have a difficult time reaching that equilibrium. For example, on ""Wax!,"" the bass and guitar are clearly aiming for counterpoint; they just never connect with one another. Other times, elements seem misplaced and superfluous, like the closing guitar riff on ""A Needle That Skips."" What holds the band back most, though, is their impatience. Haymarket Riot will hit on an appealing theme, then move on long before the motif is adequately ""milked."" So it is with ""(The) Fight."" It begins with some pep as the drums warm up to a breakbeat, but the band proceeds to wander into a straight-ahead punk frolic, then later to standard down-tempo balladry. And at the end, they revert to more of the punk thing they started in the middle of the track, failing to deliver what the song's intro promises. Bad moves all-around. Restless, shifty compositions can sound great (e.g. Don Caballero), but the changes, even when totally unpredictable, need to make sense together. Haymarket Riot often fails to accomplish this; they sound like they're messing with dynamics just for the hell of it, or out of a sense of obligation. Occasionally, the experiment works; ""Technicolor Bombs,"" ""Immaculate,"" and ""Castor Oil"" are all at least coherent. Still, even of those, only ""Castor Oil"" sticks with you after the disc stops spinning. So, what happened was that the anarchists bombed the cops, which subsequently derailed the eight-hour-day movement, and led to the hanging of four people who probably had nothing to do with the bombing in the first place. Thanks to the Haymarket Riot, American industry had free-reign to exploit workers well through the turn of the century. And 115 years later, a post-punk band got named in its honor. Love those politics.","Any band that names itself after a famous event in history understands that the majority of its reviews will begin ...

As we speak, the staffers in this proverbial chamber have been squabbling over the term ""emo"" for going on two years. Raw-nerved from lack of sleep and tense from infighting, the panel sits amidst overflowing ashtrays, greasy take-out boxes, coffee cups, and empty Tums containers. The Chairman slumps as the rookie panel member takes off his shoe to thump loudly, Khrushchev-style, across the table. ""We must retire the word 'emo,' says the rookie. ""It's applied to everything, and means nothing."" A sleepy advisor laughs. ""It never did."" ""You are making fun of me,"" says the rookie. ""You seem so opposed to use of the word 'emo.' What do you suggest we use instead?"" asks the Chairman. The rookie folds his hands across his chest. ""It would depend on the band, sir."" The Chairman shuffles through the CDs at the center of the table. He pulls out Aveo's Bridge to the Morning Lights, and places it in the stereo system. The room is flooded with the sound of a slightly off-key muted tenor wail. ""Sounds like Morrissey,"" says the sleepy official. ""But not as good. Are these guys from England?"" ""Seattle,"" says the chairman. ""Then what's with the accent? ""It's all part of the act. The Smiths thing. You can hear it in the guitars, too."" He shifts it to track three. ""This is the title track, but tell me if you don't think it's a dead ringer for 'This Charming Man...'"" ""I don't see what this has to do with the topic at hand,"" says the rookie. ""Everything,"" says the sleepy official. ""Fetishizing the Smiths in general, and Morrissey, in particular, have been cornerstones of the emo subculture for years. Not to mention that the seemingly deliberate, slightly off-keyness of the vocal delivery recalls the Promise Ring."" ""Aveo's a fairly new band,"" says the Chairman. ""This is their debut album. Its nine tracks are sequenced in reference to loosely connected anecdotes about sadness, alienation, suicide, roadtrips, and ennui, which are delivered somewhat tongue-in-cheek in the liner notes. Lyrics are derived from the cunning extraction of certain lines from these stories."" ""So?"" asks the rookie. ""Sounds like Belle and Sebastian. You wouldn't call Belle and Sebastian emo."" ""Well,"" says the chairman, ""I personally don't think Belle and Sebastian sound all that much like the Smiths. And despite the seemingly glib tone of the liner notes, the super-heartfelt vocal delivery makes me question Aveo vocalist/guitarist William Wilson's ironic intent. It sounds too earnest. Also, consider ""End of This Dull Continent,"" the second track. That staggered time signature, the guitar parts cribbed from Death Cab for Cutie, the slow build from quiet and barely rocking to a little louder and..."" ""Slightly more rocking,"" says the sleepy advisor. ""Though I take issue with the word 'rocking,' sir."" ""Let's leave that be,"" says the Chairman. ""But what about 'Neverhome'?"" asks the rookie. ""It's upbeat and there's an accordion."" The sleepy advisor scoffs. ""Again, sounds like the Smiths."" ""And I'd like to take this moment to inform the whole panel that the band's name, Aveo, is the Latin word for 'I desire.'"" [collective groan] The sleepy advisor nods. ""But you know, for the record-- and its possible categorization under a disputed term aside-- this album isn't really terrible. Perhaps a bit boring-- all the songs sound mostly the same-- and derivative. And some of the tracks are pretty good. ""Higherness,"" for example, has a nice, driving beat, and comes closer to rocking than most of the album. Also, ""Tomorrow Today"" is catchy as hell, and could vie for great song status if only the guitars weren't so resolutely pleasant and William Wilson wasn't so determined to sound like Morrissey."" The rookie slides back into his chair. ""You're gonna call this emo, aren't you?"" ""Well, I could just call it Heavily Inspired By The Smiths and leave it at that, but considering the demographic likely to purchase and enjoy this record, emo wouldn't be too much of a stretch. Also, the overall sound-- the plaintive vocals, the pretty melancholy, the cheerless self-indulgence... I mean, how much more of a recommendation do you need? Like you said, we apply the word 'emo' to everything. We could just call it indie rock, but tell me the last time that meant anything at all."" ""Maybe you're right."" ""I know I'm right,"" says the Chairman. ""And on that note, I think it's time for all of us to go home.

Doing Their Own Thing,Maceo Parker,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff69d034d5c69bf25d3/1:1/w_160/a357cb12.gif,2001-12-12 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6172-doing-their-own-thing/,Fuel 2000Fuel 2000,"Son of a bitch. What else do you call a guy willing to sabotage the futures and success of his children, the ones he helped bring in to the world, and the ones who presumably have the most to gain from his support? Of course, there are always two sides to every story, but I figure when the tale involves even a little of the supposed foul play this one does, somebody is going to come out dirty. So, what did the kids think of father, then? No, not father-- Godfather. And it could've been a breakout success if only his reach hadn't extended so far. This is the family feud that was James Brown's scene. Sometime in the spring of 1970, big brother Maceo Parker, Brown's main sax man since '64, got the idea that living under the funky thumb of the hardest working man in show-business was perhaps not a great deal. Some say he rebelled, others say that it was simply time for a change of scenery, but whatever the case, bad deeds were done, and the only stuff to come out on the sunny end were a few sides of classic funk. Father Brown had discovered Maceo (and his little brother, drummer Melvin) during a tour stop in North Carolina. The pair was only just out of high school, but Brown knew a good feeling when he heard it and quickly snatched up the duo. The brothers Parker joined the touring band, and were also featured on Brown's hit ""I Got You (I Feel Good),"" before getting picked up by another charismatic unit, the U.S. Army. So, they served a different kind of tour for a few years, but returned in the late sixties (Maceo in '67, Melvin in '69). Of course, going on the road with James Brown wasn't exactly all good times. Eating from papa's bag could be an infuriating exercise in humility. Brown had the nasty habit of accepting any and all credit for the music issued under his name, despite the fact that riffs, arrangements and sometimes even entire tunes were created by his sidemen soldiers. On top of that, he was never known as the highest paying bandleader. So, it came to pass in May of 1970 that Maceo led a mini-walkout, taking almost all of JB's band with him. The first record they made was under the moniker Maceo and All the King's Men, which is a good indication of the rebellion Maceo must have known he was committing. They cut nine songs for the album Doing Their Own Thing (""Thank You for Letting Me Be Myself Again"" is a bonus track here), and issued one single in 1970. Their music was tried-and-true funky soul and bar-band balladry, and not a lick of it was ever going to see the top 40 if Brown could help it. Now, I should add that there's a considerable amount of uncertainty (at least on record) as to the exact happenings regarding Brown and this band of upstarts. The prevailing story is that the Godfather actually paid disc jockeys across the land not to play tunes by Maceo's bunch. There's also the notion that the record was subject to merely bad distribution. Whatever the case, all the King's men only had the opportunity to make one more album before disbanding. Most of the guys went back to Brown, who seemingly welcomed them with open arms. It's a dicey story, but in any case, some pretty nice music was left behind by one of the best bands never to have had a chance. Fittingly, the album begins with ""Maceo,"" a slow, churning piece of hard funk. It's basically an excuse to have this band's leader blow a few choruses of his patented razor-sharp vamp-jazz. He sticks to tenor here (Maceo didn't switch to alto until 1973), but there's no mistaking his tone and style for anyone else's. The tune features only the barest of melodies, and in fact, was probably the kind of thing that would've been stretched out to lather up a crowd in concert. ""Got to Get 'Cha"" is more classic groove, and is actually still in the touring book of Maceo's band today. This one actually features the sax man's distinctive vocals, owing much to Brown's guttural pounce. Brother Melvin lays down a tight, mid-tempo beat, and the horns (including L.D. Williams on tenor and trumpeters Richard Griffith and Joseph Davis) nail the punches harder than Kool's Gang or a Tower of Power ever dreamed possible. The band pays its respect to the Apollo showtune in jams like ""Shake It Baby"" (double time, rock-n-soul revue party fare) and ""I Remember Mr. Banks"" (jazzy, hard-blues ballad, in the style of Allen Toussaint's early organ trio sides). These are the kinds of tunes that sound best in a room of crowded, sweaty people. For the first, make room to shake everything you got; for the second, grab your girl and slow jam every waking second that Griffith's aching, muted trumpet wails. After the short stint on their own, most of the band's members would continue to perform with Brown, in addition to further solo ventures and stints with other acts (most notably the P-Funk mob). Today, Maceo leads his own soldiers across the world playing the same old funky music he's been playing over the course of the last few decades. And from what I've read, he doesn't hold any grudges against a certain mentor who may have stalled this initial effort. Of course, Parker has long since been given his due by a new generations of fans, but I still wonder what old JB thinks of the kids that tried to branch out into their own thing. You know what they say about payback.","Son of a bitch. What else do you call a guy willing to sabotage the futures and success of his ...

We Love Life,Pulp,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a152b1335d7bf169821e/1:1/w_160/b01b3e7f.jpg,2001-12-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6507-we-love-life/,Island,"Pulp got together back in 1978. Frontman Jarvis Cocker was 15. He's now 38. Yes, that's a damn long time to be in a band, but surprisingly, the group's only original member wears it well. Having withstood 23 years and an indeterminable number of line-up changes, you'd think that Pulp would long since have started repeating themselves. But if there's anything these Yorkshire gents are not, it's stale. In fact, it's possible that on We Love Life, they're fresher than ever. Part of the reason for this is that they've always embraced change, constantly pushing in new directions. Jarvis Cocker is still speaking up for the outsiders and freaks of the world, and the overt sexuality that's always informed his delivery is still a presence, but its context has changed completely. Cocker's worldview has moved to an alternate plane since the libidinous come-ons of Different Class (perhaps their last album, the ultra-dark masterstroke This Is Hardcore, excised all of those urges). Now, Cocker and the band seem to have grown into their station in life, the misfits stuck in the middle of the limelight. Pulp worked with the legendary British producer Chris Thomas (who has produced everyone from the Sex Pistols to Roxy Music to John Cale, as well as playing session keyboard on the Beatles' White Album) for both 1995's Different Class and This Is Hardcore. And they attempted to work with him again on We Love Life, but with the sessions half-finished, the band decided to scrap the tapes and start over. They quickly decided on another British legend: songwriter Scott Walker, a man known for his seedy song topics and baroque instrumentation. This switch in producers, having changed nearly everything about the band's sound, is immediately evident. We Love Life marches in with ""Weeds"" on top of Nick Banks' militaristic snare drum and unexpected layers of acoustic guitars. For his part, Cocker essentially addresses the double standards that exist in our lives, driving especially hard at the image-conscious upper class who ""still come around to visit us when [they] fancy booze and drugs."" This segues seamlessly into the trip-hoppish groove of ""Weeds II (The Origin of the Species),"" over which Cocker delivers one of his trademark spoken monologues. Over a strangely EQ'd bassline, he deals in metaphors wherein the common folk are the weeds of society. ""Weeds must be kept under control or they will destroy everything in their path,"" he sneers. That's not an idle observation, either; it's delivered like genuine threat to some abstract authority figure. The groove pauses to emphasize the point, evaporating briefly into an ambient ether before the band picks back up. The album's other spoken track is even better, revolving around a recounting of a visit to the spot where a river has been diverted under a city. Somehow, Cocker manages to conjure all of the dirt and grit of the littered sidewalks and faltering buildings without ever directly referencing them. His personal changes are evident here, as well. In 1995, he wrote to his boyhood crush, ""Let's all meet up in the year 2000/ Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?"" Now that the year has come and gone, he seems resigned to the fact that he can never meet up with his lost loves or salvage the past. Rather, he has to content himself with visiting the dam where they met, fantasizing about taking a trip down the river, beneath the city and the people living in it. Elsewhere, we're treated to some of the best traditional songs that Pulp have ever written, in ""The Trees"" and ""Bad Cover Version."" A brilliant string ostinato anchors the groove of ""The Trees,"" in which Cocker laments a lost love, similarly coming to terms with the fact that trying to get it back just isn't a possibility. ""Might as well go and tell it to the trees,"" he sings, and it's at this point that you first realize that he seems to be seeking real emotional commitment far removed from the lascivious sportfucking that his older songs favored. ""Bad Cover Version"" addresses roughly the same theme from a different angle, with Cocker smirkingly comparing his ex's new boyfriend to himself, offering that ""a bad cover version of love is not the real thing."" The band's sense of humor enters the fray in the coda, and they even get in a jab at their own producer, likening ""the second side of Til the Band Comes In"" (Walker's fifth solo album) to an off-brand box of cornflakes and sugar substitutes. Other targets include ""the Stones since the 80s,"" the ""Planet of the Apes"" TV show, and the late-period ""Tom & Jerry"" episodes where they could talk. This is followed by ""Roadkill,"" an acoustic reflection on a trip to the airport to pick up the other half of a doomed relationship. The narrator catches sight of a deer dying in the road, and in retrospect, takes it as a sign that the relationship was doomed to begin with. From this emotional low point, though, comes the phoenix of ""Sunrise,"" the album's stirring closer and one of the most optimistic songs Pulp have ever recorded. ""I used to hate the sun/ Because it shone on everything I had done,"" begins Cocker, ultimately summing up the band's entire career: ""You've been awake all night/ So why should you crash out at dawn?"" Pulp's long night may be over, but the day looks just as promising. On their seventh album, Pulp have pulled off yet another remarkable reinvention of their sound and outlook, while simultaneously making their most organic album since their full-length debut, It, was released almost two decades ago. The cheap synths that made their last few albums so delightfully sleazy are almost completely absent, replaced by Mark Webber's well-developed guitar melodies and a more peripheral role for the electronics. And that's all good, because the last thing I'd want is for Pulp to get stale on me. On this evidence, it seems likely that they'll stay fresh well into the new century.","Pulp got together back in 1978. Frontman Jarvis Cocker was 15. He's now 38. Yes, that's a damn ...

A Tall Tale Storyline,Mazarin,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f05e6ef95969323944/1:1/w_160/2ada1dd2.jpg,2001-12-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5166-a-tall-tale-storyline/,spinART,"Rock lore tells that George Harrison's All Things Must Pass was crammed with so many great tunes because Harrison felt creatively stymied in the Beatles and was able to bring massive amounts of the good noise during the post-breakup closet-cleaning. It's said that you can hear the joy in Harrison's voice on that album, joy that came from him finally being able to take what was inside and show it to the world. Having listened to the album for the first time in a while this past week, I'm inclined to agree. I hear some of that same joy on the second album by Mazarin, the band led by Quentin Stolzfus, former drummer for Azusa Plane. Stolzfus only played drums for the band part-time, as a chunk of the Plane's music was too drony to require extra percussion work. But this guy was wasting his talent dragging a violin bow across a ride cymbal; he's a songwriter with a real melodic gift. Leaving the 20-minute d-chord mediations behind, Mazarin finds Stolzfus crafting punchy pop tunes with a rootsy edge. Acoustic guitar provides the foundation, the melodies are sung in two- and three-part harmony, and there's a countrified folk cast to A Tall Tale Storyline. And though this may sound like a backhanded compliment, some of it reminds me of Girlfriend-era Mathew Sweet. It's nowhere near as slick a record as that comparison would suggest, but both Stolzfus' voice and his 60s-inspired arrangements bear some similarity. And hey, I like Girlfriend. ""Go Home"" opens A Tall Tale Storyline with the album's only bit of drone music, a whine that shifts gears and becomes crystalline, west-coast pop about three minutes in, complete with wordless vocal interplay and ringing guitar strums. It's no surprise when the eventual lyrics include the line, ""Going back to California."" The eight-minute opener is an anomaly; much more typical is the 3\xBD-minute ""What Sees the Sky?,"" with layered vocals that make you think there's got to be a Crosby, Stills or Nash hiding in the studio somewhere, and Byrdsian guitar chimes on the simple, effective chords. The acoustic guitar is used to different effect on ""2.22.1"" and ""RJF Variation 1,"" two lovely variations on the fingerpicking instrumental folk of John Fahey and Leo Kottke. ""My Favorite Green Hill"" could be one of the rock tunes on REM's Life's Rich Pageant, and ""The Limits of Language"" is almost pure country, complete with pedal steel and a Nashville lilt to the rhythm. A Tall Tale Storyline is a diverse record, but all genres covered have their origins in American roots music, so the feel is unified. Mazarin can seem just a bit dilettantish at times (the straight county is just not terribly convincing somehow), but the stakes feel low, and this is an easy record to like. So consider putting those Azusa Plane records back on the stack, opening the shades, and giving the drummer some.","Rock lore tells that George Harrison's All Things Must Pass was crammed\n\ with so many great tunes because ...

Low Level Owl Vol. I & II,The Appleseed Cast,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e35e6ef9596932006d/1:1/w_160/8430e6f6.gif,2001-12-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/260-low-level-owl-vol-i-ii/,Deep Elm,"When Appleseed Cast released The End of the Ring Wars three years ago, they were the embodiment of late 90s emo-rock, playing with an intense abandon that displayed the extent of their ambition. The problem was, the ambition seemed uncontrolled, and the album came off like an emotional effigy of the band's aspirations which their experience wasn't quite capable of making fully palpable. Last year's Mare Vitalis found them reigning in their sound and softening the edges while simultaneously beginning to experiment with new textures. The album ended with an extended untitled track of feedback and guitar loops that no one could have predicted was the fuse to what was coming next. Low Level Owl is a supernova and a full redefinition of the band, a sprawling two-disc monster that redirects their ambition from the emotional release of their earlier albums into the meticulous conceptions crafted through endless hours of studio time. Overhauling their sound and incorporating a wide mélange of styles, Low Level Owl goes a long way towards emasculating any of their previous hardcore influences by injecting a thoughtful, gentler Britpop jangle and winsome vocals and harmonies. The result is a mix of elements combining the enterprising studio conceptions of Radiohead with touches of shimmering Stone Roses psychedelia knitted together with the conviction and energetic drumming of the early U2, all draped over a monolithic prog-rock conceptual framework. The technical execution throughout the album is flawless. The rock tracks are spread evenly across both Low Level Owl discs (which are available separately-- Use Your Illusion-style-- presumably so as to not overwhelm listeners) and are interspersed with instrumental and ambient tracks that act as connective tissue. Josh Baruth's fantastic drumming is placed in the front of the mix and propels all of the traditional songs. Each of the tracks are awash in keyboards with the vocals generally lying low in the mix, making the lyrics difficult to decipher. These are the only constants through the entire work as Appleseed Cast takes you on a tour through most of the highlights of 90s pop and rock. Both albums are balanced, each beginning and ending with instrumentals and connected in the middle by the droning ""View of a Burning City"" that ends the first disc and picks back up on the second. The combination of ""The Walking of Pertelotte"" and ""On Reflection"" clocks in at 8\xBD minutes, and bookends the front of the project. Over an hour and forty-five minutes later, ""Confession,"" a nine-minute ambient head-trip closes the second disc. Both albums last fifty three minutes. Just the arrangement of the music alone shows the amount of thought that goes into an album of this size. Hints of other bands occur throughout-- from the Stone Roses in ""Mile Marker,"" to My Bloody Valentine in ""The Argument,"" to Built to Spill in ""Reaction""-- all embedded a lush wave of production reminiscent of the Flaming Lips, Spiritualized or Mogwai. There are also elements of Brian Eno and Aphex Twin that pop up during the ambient sections, and tracks like ""Flowers Falling from Dying Hands"" which remind me of Sonic Youth's ""Providence."" Needless to say, Appleseed Cast have come a long way since that 1998 debut of frail failure. With Low Level Owl, they establish their own unique vision for the future of rock, offering hope and brighter possibilities for the genre-- or rather, creating their own. These two albums have generated an incredible amount of hype in small sects of the indie rock population, while most who haven't been privy to the band's peerless new sounds still associate the band with their sensitive suburban roots. It's time to look past the stereotype and herald Appleseed Cast for what they are now, and what they're about to become: groundbreaking.","When Appleseed Cast released The End of the Ring Wars three years ago,\n\ they were the embodiment of late ...

I also just wanted to let you personally know how much that track you did with Shabba Ranks meant to me when I was first starting out. It really opened my eyes to new forms of expression in hip-hop music. Anyway, I've included a copy of my new CD. I'd love it if you'd let me know what you think of it. Thanks! Sincerely,

""The most significant and original new voice in hip-hop..."" --The Independent - - - - - Manuva, Don't fucking kid yourself, I know the act. Seems like things are going nice for you right now, and honestly, I'm happy for you. I think you're a good kid. But this new album you sent me, what the fuck? I don't even know where to start on this bullshit. The first track, it's called ""No Strings,"" but actually it's nothing but strings. I guess you think you're doing something very clever here. Rodney, fuck, listen to me: it's just tepid. All of it. You're riding the wave of novelty right now. I didn't rhyme my way out of the motherfucking gutter on NME hype. If you stay on this path your next stop's gonna be a Thievery Corporation cameo. All your reviews begin with, ""Where else will you hear someone rapping about [insert Britishism here]?"" Who gives a fuck about ""ten pints of bitter?"" You were never lyrically stunning, to say the very least, but at least you were listenable; now it's like trying to sit through a blunted knock-knock joke with no punchline. To make it all somehow worse, the only real (read: American) MC on the whole thing is that clown from J5 on ""Join the Dots,"" and he's easily the worst lyricist in the history of this rap shit. Namedropping Anthony Kiedis, for fuck's sake, Rodney, that's unforgivable. I dunno, maybe the words would be a bit more palatable if not for your voice. Oh, that voice. Christ. On your first album it seemed like your rugged (yawn) vocal stylings were almost something close to fresh, but now with the production thinned to the most boring minimum (and after hearing too fucking many two-step raga shouters), a weak cockney sputter just doesn't hold my interest at all. Everything on here seems stolen, and not just because the (unintentionally?) shaky religious doubt of ""Sinny Sin Sin"" comes directly from my On Christian Hypocrisy chapter. You've jumbled all the flaws of every ponderous underground hip-hop animal into a confusingly repulsive (and, lest i forget, British) MC. It's a bad thing. So your voice is dry, the rhymes are shook (""the return of the Rootical one?"" What the fuck?) and, hate to say it, but the beats are worse than ever. A damn shame, too, because your last had some incredible tracks. ""Clockwork"" was one of the hottest old world moody-style joints of '99 for sure. How did your skills behind the boards slip so bad? It's sad to see the guy who effortlessly floated on the grainy charcoal-sketched Mobb Deep wail of ""Movements"" driven to the hollow two-note keyboard loops and boring dirgy bass of almost every track here. Grotesque bids at dance cred are strictly 1997. I paid my dues with Goldie already so you can sit the fuck down. Honestly, I can't even believe UK ""electronica"" culture is coming out for this languid failure anyway. It's certainly no more rewarding in the club than back at home. Here's some production advice: lay off the fucking weed! I borrowed from dub's framework to get hardcore bounce-back, you're just coming off with funkless rewrites of Shaggy's ""Boombastic"" injected with ill-conceived pretension. At this point, even Wu got you bested on the reggae-rap front and they're just half-heartedly fucking around with it. Better luck next time. Peace,

The Altogether,Orbital,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9fa5e6ef95969322abb/1:1/w_160/a1a0f191.jpg,2001-12-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6032-the-altogether/,SireLondon,"Ever hear the music of the spheres? Pythagoras thought he did. Or at least he theorized that the heavens were organized like the earth, in a geometry that you could define and study. Music was another aspect of that model, and the octave intervals that sounded pleasing to the ear represented basic mathematical fractions. He suggested that the planets should be spaced in similar numerical ratios, and therefore, their movements in orbit would resonate sonically-- slower stars at a lower pitch, faster stars at a higher. Who knows, the Pythagoreans might even have been on to something; recently, one astronomer has shown that meteor trails emit low frequency radio waves, which could be picked up by certain things on the ground like pine needles or even frizzy hair and converted to sound just as you see the fiery trail streak across the sky. I used to hear the music of the spheres from Orbital. Even if their early singles weren't direct recordings of planetary alignments, you could imagine hearing ""Chime"" or ""Halcyon + On + On"" at a club in the rings of Saturn. Techno that elegant was practically the reason for the shift to the term ""electronica."" I remember the confusion when Snivilisation dropped in '94; some rave kids weren't used to such intricate melodic detail and concept albums about societal trends. But two years later, brothers Phil and Paul Hartnoll followed up with In Sides, one of electronic pop music's all-time classic albums, a perfect mix of dancefloor dynamics and emotional intensity. On 1999's The Middle of Nowhere they seemed to fall off a bit. The beats were still lively but the melodic inventiveness was too often stranded for cheap diva vocals and other sundry fills. Alright, I admit-- their newest project has been like some wretched fairytale stepchild at Pitchfork staff meetings for the last half-year, the target of furrowed brows and disappointed sighs but never quite mentioned by name. But hell, someone had to break the news eventually. The album title is mostly accurate: The Altogether is just that, a bunch of samples and stuff all thrown together. In short, wack. The lead song actually promises of new directions. ""Tension"" draws a buzzy bassline from the Bananamen's cover of the 1964 top ten hit ""Surfin' Bird"" and thrusts it into one of Orbital's hardest floor-fillers. Some sampled rocker dude groans over the bumped-up BPM and a Hartnoll trademark: oscillating synth ululations that freak out all over the equalizer. The other amazing track was stuck at the very end, I'm guessing to put a pretty cover on the rest of the pulp. ""Meltdown"" may have been prepared for a dance troop in London's south bank, but don't expect Dieter prancing around in black. It begins with this delicious, dirty jungle beat before busting into a concrete symphony of telephones beeping, typewriters clacking and analog whine. It would have fit nicely on either of the companion discs to In Sides. But then, for balance, the tracks that must have led Sire execs to blow a load: ""Waving Not Drowning"" recycles an acoustic guitar riff into an infinity of Belle & Garfunkel acid-trip excess. Fold your hands, Hartnolls, you loop like My First Logic Audio. And then there's the atrocity of ""Illuminate,"" a milquetoast synth-pop number to which folkster David Gray (Phil Hartnoll's brother-in-law) lends sappy vocals. Sting is spilling his frappuccino somewhere in frustration that this Welsh guy beat him in such a craven appeal to adult contemporary radio. Only in the clueless U.S. would marketing goons have failed to pipe this into a Wal-Mart near you. In-between, results are mixed. ""Funny Break (One Is Enough)"" is too much, really, as Naomi Bedford breaks apart a tribal-techno rhythm with her attempt at lyricism: ""This love is drivin' me crazy!"" Whatever happened to the wordless ethereality of Alison Goldfrapp's incredible vocals on tracks like ""Sad But True?"" Instead we get ""Oi!"" in which Ian Dury's sampled sax wanks along with yet more diva constipation and trance synth-bass so generic Eskimos & Egypt would have been embarrassed to use it on one of their early-90s rave anthems. At least the boutique-friendly subtlety of ""Pay Per View"" is inoffensive, but it's still by-the-numbers Orbital, nothing you haven't heard before. ""Tootled,"" which is constructed from samples of Tool's ""Sober"" and anarchists Crass, just rehashes Orbital's collaboration with Kirk Hammett on the Spawn soundtrack. And ""Shadows"" should have been dumped with the TV pilot it was written for-- the dark Underworld ambience teases, but then enter the operatic wailing. You might dig it if you still have a jones for Apotheosis' ""O Fortuna."" Oh, and then there's the ""Dr. Who"" theme novelty remix. See what I mean? It's not that Paul and Phil shouldn't be allowed to have any fun; it's just that ""fun"" should never be an excuse for not doing the absolute best you can do. They've also been tossing about the term ""for laughs"" a lot in recent interviews. But if they think goofing off in the studio is funny, the joke will be on them when not many are laughing along. In ten years, you'll be mistaking their superficial work here for the Chemical Brothers, Crystal Method, or Fatboy Slim's big-beat bullshit. I guess it's a sign that techno has entered the establishment-- as with recent disappointments from U2, REM and Depeche Mode, so, too, with the Orb, Aphex Twin and now Orbital. It's just a shame to hear such a lack of ambition from true pioneers. The duo used to be a focal point around which constellations of sound revolved. These days, they've set their sights on stars with far less luster.","Ever hear the music of the spheres? Pythagoras thought he did. Or at least he theorized that the heavens were ...

Aleamapper,Richard Devine,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97b13d197565213ae76/1:1/w_160/9bbcfafa.gif,2001-12-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2302-aleamapper/,Schematic,"The word ""organic"" gets tossed around a hell of a lot in discussions of electronic music. I myself have even thrown it into a review or twenty, so I may as well take a stab at a definition, however awkward: I use ""organic"" to describe sound that seems derived from some kind of primordial logic or process that gives the illusion of falling outside the realm of human creation. It has something to do with structure, process and product being integrated in a way that the final piece seems whole and complete. When music is organic, I find myself contemplating the work as a singular entity instead of adding up the individual pieces. Oval comes to mind when I imagine the ultimate in organic music. When I listen to Oval-- particularly his last three records-- the man behind the music disappears and I'm interfacing directly with the aggregate sound as a living thing in itself. I know Markus Popp had reasons for placing this crackle here and this glitch there (he is the designer, after all), but the logic of the micro seems unfathomable. Listening becomes a top-down process. I mention the idea of the organic in the context of Richard Devine's Aleamapper because this music is the diametric opposite of the word. This album, which serves as a darker, dronier companion to this year's Lipswitch, is a thread of disconnected fragments streaming by endlessly, like metallic objects on an assembly line. The whole is invisible; all you can make out are the dead, inert chunks of material. This is machine music divorced from the lifecycle, where the digitally derived sound sources are so clearly a product of powerful computers that if I close my eyes, I can almost see the scrolling window of Cubase in preview mode. But all this is not to say that the record is bad; in fact, the direct ""man at the computer"" vibe of Aleamapper makes good sense in the context of the overall mood. But I only want to listen to such music occasionally, in a very specific time and place. For most of Aleamapper, Devine eschews the beats in favor of moody, rumbling ambient atmosphere. But there are a few moments of the frantic, cut-up funk that marked Lipswitch. Upbeat tracks like ""Vecpr"" and ""Step Focus"" are steeped in electro, but miles removed from the robotic party jams of Grandmaster Flash and the Egyptian Lover. Like the pioneers of Detroit techno, Richard Devine sees the cold and isolated heart of the cyborg, but unlike them, he never inverts the gloom with a dose of dancefloor transcendence. In fact, only the gorgeous bed-of-clouds drone of ""Float 82"" allows any sort of respite from the ugliness of Aleamapper. The reference point that keeps coming to mind is Tokyo-based sound artist Christophe Charles, who released a compilation of his work on Mille Plateaux in 1997 called Undirected 1986-1996. Charles used field recordings as sources for his collages (he provided Markus Popp with recordings of bells for manipulation for Oval's Dok), and arranged them randomly using a computer program that can also be found on his CD (Mac only, dammit). Charles' use of chance operations gave Undirected an unpredictable feel that Aleamapper lacks, but both records contain long passages comprised of disorienting pieces of sound in relentless motion. Devine has done a nice job putting it all together, and remember, he meant for the stitches to jut out like red, swollen welts. But still, there's something here that keeps me at arm's length, and I feel stationary and somewhat removed from the action as the sounds stream by. In any case, Aleamapper is a bleak tunnel of inorganic sound to be journeyed occasionally.","The word ""organic"" gets tossed around a hell of a lot in discussions of electronic music.

Hide your daughters and old Paul Simon tapes, because no one will be spared. You thought Wendy Carlos was a joke? Oh no, she/he was only the beginning. And it gets worse. You see, it turns out that this is one revolution that, no matter how seemingly intimidating and complicated (let's face it, the Borg are most likely listening to Autechre), is probably for the best. The more I delve into new music, the more I find it contaminated by the all-assimilating force that is electronic music production. Older artists are stepping over their fanbase to work with techno producers, while the young ones are throwing away subscriptions to CMJ for old Beatfreakery rags. The good and bad news: most of the stuff sounds no worse than your average zeitgeistmusik. And there are a thousand stories in this revolution: David Bowie outdoes Trent Reznor in the late 90s, and I realize why that isn't such a great deal; scores of bands rip off Can and Cluster and call it ""post-rock,"" wondering why Stereolab fans think they're boring (Stereolab fans!), and some end up pretty decent. To me, though, the coolest stories are the ones that end up like Rotoscope. Norwegian composer Andreas Mjøs formed the electro-acoustic outfit Rotoscope in autumn 1999. With an eye towards Warp and Ninja Tune, he started the band in an attempt to reconcile the purely electronic music played in clubs with modern experimental music, all with the idea of playing live. The band features musicians from all walks of arty life: classical composers, jazz players, pop singers, orchestral musicians-- it's a something of a brainstorming session for the tuned-in and overachieving. And they sound neat, too. Great Curves is the band's first album, though for the most part, it sounds as if these guys (and one gal) are old pros at putting stuff to DAT. All of the tunes are messed with, mostly on the production end, as the band and co-producer Jørgen Træen seem to have an inexhaustible array of effects, loops and otherwise unnatural doings transpiring. Some people call this stuff IDM (an inadequate description at best) or electronica (a stupid term altogether), but there are too many roots in traditional sounds and structures here to give all the credit to machines. ""Press Stop"" begins things with a bang and a glitch, as percussion and wailing saxophone are cut up beyond repair, put through who knows what number of computer-generated filters and patches. It's quite short, but it most certainly sends the right signals: this isn't going to be your average jazz-informed indie statement. ""All That You Owned (Remix),"" something of a skittish, distracted ballad, is the first tune to feature the childlike vocals of Christine Sandtorv. Distant, sometimes-backwards piano, record-scratch atmospherics, and a bassline that only occasionally makes itself at home in the proceedings peep in and out in no discernable order, turning what could have been a simple tune into the most complicated two-minute ""song"" I've heard in a while. ""The Bogota Sub"" is born out of the distortions of the previous tune, and quickly launches into more glitches and computer-chaos. However, the unmistakable feel of acoustic percussion and horns are all over this track (and the rest of the album), and despite the fact that actual humans could probably never play this way live, the tune isn't far from some kind of future jazz groove I imagine would sound great while overdosing on two or three media of your choice. Try, the soundtrack to watching three television sets at once, two of which are broadcasting the end of 2001, and the other Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi. ""Cooks Whip, Music Goes On"" makes a jazz noise or two, especially via Lars Horntveth's ultra-suede tenor playing during the solo break in the middle. Real drums drop some real groove, vibraphones vibe, and for the most part, I find it very easy to label this ""modern jazz."" But labels suck, so I'll stick with ""stuff that sounds like jazz, if it were made be people listening to new music-- and by new music, I don't mean the new Lenny Kravitz"" music. Other tunes are much closer to the purely electronic realm, such as ""Watercooler"" or the Talking Heads-referencing ""Divide and Dissolve."" These tunes may have had roots in acoustic/live performance, but are subject to so much post-production that they could probably pass as straight IDM in most quarters. The former is a brief display of reverb-laden drum machine blips and bangs, with a by-now familiar (in electronic music, anyway) disorienting, distorted glitch presence. The latter is a lengthier percussive exhibition, steering closer to jungle theory (as defined by new Boredoms, not Goldie) than post-everything sensory overload. After a restrained intro, things get rather out of hand, what with all the hurricane toms and rocket ship engine thrust noises. I'd say it was all too much, except it's such great stuff. Great Curves ends with the epic ""Traveller,"" which brings vocalist Sandtorv back into the mix, and excludes almost everything computer-generated. Hypnotic keyboard motive aside, this is a fairly addictive song. Sandtorv's singing could be a potential source of annoyance, particularly for anyone who isn't down with girly-girl vocalizing, but it seems to fit well here. In any case, her section of the tune ends quickly, leading to an instrumental vamp with layers and layers of Horntveth's woodwinds and some nice acoustic guitar. It reminds me a little of the last tune from Idiology, but these guys play soulful where Mouse on Mars was cinematic, and assured where the German duo was innocent and playful. An intriguing finale to a release with that's almost always at odds with what a band given their instrumentation should sound like. Recommended.","Well, it's official: electronic music is taking over. Hide your daughters and\n\ old Paul Simon tapes, because no ...

Liberation,Jackie-O Motherfucker,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bb5e6ef95969320261/1:1/w_160/5f5c2323.gif,2001-12-10 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4186-liberation/,Road Cone,"The late French historian Ferdinand Braudel demanded that history be written in the longue duree. History's typical subject matter, politics and war, were but weather fluttering above the passage of a deeper time-- the time of soil and seas, the rise and fall of populations, the global transit of diseases, the expansion of economies. Beneath the speeches and explosions, history creeps along in the long span; perhaps it was all slower than anyone might have imagined. Though bound to the seventy-five minute surface of a compact disc, Portland's Jackie-O Motherfucker have discovered the secret of making music in the longue duree. Masterminds Jef Brown and Tom Greenwood, along with the platoon of weirdo outrock soldiers of fortune with whom they surround themselves, have been crafting the perfect antithesis to the millennial strain of gloomy post-rock, a genre dominated by the likes of Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and the lately touted Explosions in the Sky. Against the ubiquitous music of crisis, Jackie-O has managed to make a very serious case for the music of continuity. Its sheer joy and wonder reside neither in tension nor resolve, neither verse nor chorus, but simply in dogged perseverance. Last year's breathtaking Fig. 5 unfolded in the deep time of the American musical past. The album simply eroded the strata of one musical epoch after another, as if beneath it all there was some secret to be disinterred. The dusty x-ray on that record's cover served as the perfect manifesto for the album: underneath all this, somewhere there must be bone, a frame and foundation that holds it all together. Liberation has no such quest; it is rivery and meandering, with no discernible source or mouth. Liberation simply travels, picking up junk and jetsam along the way, discarding it somewhere downstream, and rambling on. Beginning somewhat arbitrarily with the clatter of ""Peace on Earth,"" one gets the distinct feeling of having suddenly and for no apparent reason been made privy to the secret sound of everyday life. Drums tap out a hesitant shuffle. The plaintive vibraphone chatters brightly. The strings drone and yawn as if they were the innards of some great machine that makes everything turn. The guitars enter into the fray, commanding some sense of direction, but to little avail. One might compare the proceedings to the drone jams of Spacemen 3's Dreamweapon; both render dissonance rather precarious-- as if a song could emerge from the noise at any minute. But ""Peace on Earth"" never really resolves into a stable entity. After ten minutes, ""Peace"" simply shuts the door on the listener, as if never meant to be heard. The similarly lengthy ""Ray-O-Graph"" owes much to the dreary Celtic fog perfected by the Dirty Three. Above the programmed drizzle of the drum track, the guitar and strings manage to recreate the seasick interplay of Mick Turner and Warren Ellis. Jackie-O Motherfucker add squiggly sound effects and softly squawking horns to the mix, giving the track a kind of drunken stagger. The twanging ""Northern Line"" sets the sweet voice of Jocelyn Goldsmith above the throbbing backporch Americana that dominated Fig. 5, serving as a transitional piece in much the same way as the similarly lilting ""Beautiful September"" did on the previous album. The twenty-minute ""In Between"" cycles like seasons through sparse, wintry branches of bare guitar and lush passages of noise in full bloom. The fierce and nimble free improv drumming is easily the track's strongest suit; they're recklessly creative even when the guitar minimalism grows somewhat tiresome. As an exercise in patience, the first ten minutes of ""In Between"" is masterful; but musically, the point is made early on and is barely expanded upon. The second half, however, erupts into backwater freakout, bleeding the thin twang into thick distortion like some confederate Sonic Youth. The subtle and engaging ""Pray"" intertwines a spare and beautiful guitar line in slithering electronics. Vibes, organ and several guitars slowly begin to flesh out the sound, transforming skeletal country into irresistibly creepy psychedelia on the order of Popol Vuh. The guitars skitter off into mock-sitar, sax crows in the corner, yet the restraint and economy of ""Pray"" is almost saintly. There is a stubborn lag to Liberation that some will no doubt find infuriating. Lacking the focus and narrative of Fig. 5, Liberation occasionally plays like molasses. But the album is nonetheless beautiful, for the consistently amazing quality of Jackie-O Motherfucker is their ability to color experimental music and noise with more candor and emotional sophistication than most turtlenecked troubadours. But it takes time. And time might just be the instrument played with the most brilliance on Liberation: sped up, slowed to a crawl, made to stand dead still and maybe even at times, dismissed. The stereo display times this album at seventy-three earthly minutes, but I'm not quite sure how long the music has really been around. Seems like ages.","The late French historian Ferdinand Braudel demanded that history be written in the longue duree. History's typical subject matter ...

"Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start",Boylion,by: Christopher F.

I have emotions. Sometimes I will get angry. Sometimes I will get sad. And sometimes I will even get extremely excited. Sometimes, when I am feeling any of these things, I will pick up a guitar. Sometimes these emotions will elicit a few words and a melody. Thus, I am inevitably doomed to emo-dom. Right? No, there are a few other requisites before I can officially be welcomed into the mediocre ranks of the emo-kids. My voice must be intoned with a slight whine, I have to be pleading for my girlfriend to stay because she's in all of my dreams, and I must learn the ingenious and utterly effective juxtaposition of ""soft"" and ""loud."" Right? Perhaps. But in the end, one shouldn't automatically dismiss bands that follow the classic emo formula; I mean, Death Cab for Cutie's last record was actually quite delectable for the most part, despite the fact that Benjamin Gibbard's predominantly major-key melodies start to melt together after extended exposure. So we've established that emo is easily pigeonholed, but not always of terrible quality. But then again, there's definitely a reason why emo has such a bad reputation. Take Boylion's first record for MOC, whose title is derived from the classic cheat code to Konami-brand ""game paks"" for first generation Nintendo. One could immediately interpret this choice of title to reflect the banal and sophomoric quality of the aural material contained in the microscopic ridges of plastic, and one would be dead on. This is the music of the band that every high school in suburban America seems to have-- five emotional pre-twentysomethings trying to break the punk mold with a bit of melody and keyboard. The 50 seconds of ""Gentle Robots"" starts off the record innocuously and even hints at an attempt on experimentalism that aims to remold the inevitable cliché. The instrumental begins with a clean electric guitar strumming, eventually accompanied by some outlandish keyboard arpeggiating, which fades into the second track, ""Seton,"" where not only the experimentalism (if you could even consider it that) fades, but the seedy production enters as well. The song sounds as if it were encoded to MP3 at 98kpbs then mastered, with paper-thin sounding drums, rubbery bass, and an airy, filtered drum track. And how about a serving of high-school science class poetry: ""I rush to embrace both you and this moment."" ""What Matters Most"" kicks off with a double-tracked Matt Roan (as if one were not enough) screaming: ""She's begging me to stay."" Roan continues his romantically infatuated musings on priorities backed by a speedy one-two beat and a simple, happy-go-lucky organ line. ""Find Me"" slows things down with a pretty piano and more lines about-- guess what!-- crumbling relationships, then kicks into high gear for the loud and speedy chorus before returning to a super effectual verse with simple harmony vocals. So, to sum things up, this quartet with a shopping cart full of feelings makes songs with power chords and keyboards and rhythm changes that will make you question what would happen if these kids listened to Miles Davis. It seems that they have perfectly good intentions with those quasi-experimental bleeps and bloops, frenetic tempo and volume changes, and some pretty, yet clichéd, melodies. But in the end, these directions in music are anything but new.","I feel. I have emotions. Sometimes I will get angry. Sometimes I will get sad.\n\ And sometimes I will ...

"Solid Steel Presents: Now, Listen!",DJ Food,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b7c0084474cd0c2692/1:1/w_160/f13e4eb6.gif,2001-12-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2358-solid-steel-presents-now-listen/,Ninja Tune,"In 1939, avant-garde composer John Cage took a pair of records containing test tones, and a pair of phonographs specially designed to play at different speeds and used them to create music. The result, a piece entitled Imaginary Landscape No. 1 is commonly regarded as the first piece of turntable music. Though a few other avant-garde composers of the time would follow Cage's lead, it would be decades before the turntable's capacity as a musical instrument would truly be explored again. The 80s and 90s saw the simultaneous rise of the CD as the premiere form of recorded music and of the turntable as a musical instrument, as the discoveries of a few kids in the Bronx gave birth to a musical movement the likes of which they could never have imagined. The last few years have seen the turntablist break free of his connections with the realm of hip-hop, with DJs turning up in bands of every shape style and form. Meanwhile, artists like Christian Marclay and Kid Koala continue to push the limits of what can be done with a few record players. Still, despite the turntable's newfound commonplace status, one can't help but get the feeling at times that turntablists are the Rodney Dangerfields of the music world. No respect and all that. In the minds of many, the turntablist is not a musician, but a presenter of music. Of course, this assumption is ridiculous. As anyone who's tried their hand at manipulating vinyl will tell you, there's far more to it than just dropping a needle and pressing play. Still, it often seems that no number of amazing feats performed upon the wheels of steel will ever change the minds of the doubtful masses. Certainly, the turntables have attracted their fair share of drugged-out ravers and lazy would-be musicians. We've all been to parties where wannabe-DJs did little more than play one record after another, and we've all been bored to death by some guy at some lame club whose experimentation never developed past a simple beatmatch. But these half-assed DJs are nothing more than the turntable equivalent of your girlfriend's brother, sitting in the garage with his out-of-tune thrift store guitar, playing along to Weezer tabs he downloaded online. Real DJs-- those who take their art with all the seriousness of the most skilled classical pianist-- often show more ingenuity and creativity in the use of their instrument than most so-called ""real musicians."" And logically so. The turntable isn't like a guitar or a piano; there is no preconceived ""proper way"" to play it, no set of rules, no charts or theory to learn. It's a skill wide open to interpretation, and as such, the best turntablists are constantly redefining their craft, finding new approaches to making sound. Take Now, Listen, the newest release from DJ Food (a rotating team of musicians whose lineup currently consists of PC and Strictly Kev) and co-conspirator DK, for example. Technically speaking, this is a compilation of other people's music-- a mix CD. But the credit for the album lies, without a doubt, in the hands of the three who assembled it. It's important to note that I'm not just praising the musical tastes of the trio at the helm here. Any DJ worth their salt can compile two-dozen worthwhile tracks with his or her eyes closed. What makes or breaks an album like Now, Listen is flow. And DJ Food have it in spades. Indeed, it's the long-practiced, well-polished ability of all the artists involved here to paste together bits of sound into a cohesive whole that makes Now, Listen far more than just the sum of its parts. Equal parts hip-hop, jazz, dance, experimental, rock and IDM, all pasted together with an assortment of vocal samples (a trademark of the Solid Steel show), the record serves as a fine introduction to the sort of freeform radio these guys have been putting together for years. Since 1988, when Matt Black and Jonathan More (today you know them as Coldcut) took on a weekly late-night, freeform radio program on a London pirate radio station, Coldcut's weekly ""Solid Steel"" program has served as an outlet for turntablists more interested in making music than playing it. The thirteen years since have seen a lot of changes to the program. Today, ""Solid Steel"" is broadcast on one of London's best-known radio stations, streamed over the Internet and syndicated the world over. The show frequently plays host to guest DJs (Squarepusher, Tortoise, most of the Ninja Tune clan, etc.) and Coldcut's hosting duties have been split with DJ Food's Strictly Kev, while producer DK's role has expanded to encompass realms both creative and technical. Now, Listen is the first in a proposed series of discs intended to recreate the spirit of these broadcasts. Starting off with a crackly old big band recording before quickly jumping ship into a torrential ocean of scratches and samples, the work of the DJs is immediately apparent. After the introduction, we're off with Jeru the Damaja-- rapping and scratches-- mixed seamlessly with a downtempo instrumental by the Cinematic Orchestra. From this point on, it becomes more and more difficult to tell one ingredient from the other. There's an old saying in the DJ world that you can give 80 DJs copies of the same record and you'll never hear it played the same way twice. If only that were actually the case. Recent mix albums by DJ Spooky and Fila Brazilia have disappointed, despite excellent ingredients, due to less-than-thrilling mixes. In each of these cases, the DJs did little but build short bridges between the songs, their contributions limited to the first and last few seconds of each track. DJ Food and DK, on the other hand, use turntables, effects pedals, samplers, and sound clips from film and television and vinyl to cause their chosen songs to bleed together like cheap colored paper left out in the rain. Take the seamless layering of a Ray Bradbury monologue over David Shire's horn-heavy suspense-thriller-style ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Or the Herbie Hancock-discussing-his-love-for-electronics sample from ""Nobu"" that flawlessly links tracks by Four Tet, the Art of Noise and Boards of Canada. Or the amalgamation of Mr. Scruff's minimal electro-funk groove ""Ug,"" with the relentless verbal flow of Motion Man's ""The Terrorist"" and Peshay's drum-n-bass opus ""Miles from Home."" Sure, there are missteps, like the failed attempt to turn the Beat's ""Mirror in the Bathroom"" into an IDM track by setting it to Mask's Aphex-ian ""Square Off."" And while rare awkward moments like this may disrupt the album's flow from time to time, there are more than enough treats here to make up for it. Suffice it to say that Now, Listen is one hell of a ride from start to stop, that DJ Food is doing things with turntables that no one else is, that more often than not it's impossible to tell where the original songs end and the mixing begins, and that this is an album that deserves to be heard, by lovers of DJ culture and skeptics alike.","In 1939, avant-garde composer John Cage took a pair of records containing test tones, and a pair of phonographs specially ...

Subourbon,Land of the El Caminos,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8eabf31b7dc7155d4b/1:1/w_160/5c8a6122.gif,2001-12-09 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4663-subourbon/,Boojm,"Once upon a time, Dan Fanelli, Aaron Cleall, and Ken Wallin, three industrious lads from the suburbs of Chicago, set forth to establish a bold new civilization in the mythical Land of the El Caminos. In the Land of the El Caminos, anything is possible, provided believers accept the following tenets of the El Camino gospel: Archers of Loaf is the greatest of all time. However, the prevailing genre must always be Southern California-style pop/punk. That the only true music must be a marriage of the above band and genre. Instruments such as the keyboard, piano, and xylophone should be integrated into standard guitar/bass/drums arrangement, even if no one can play them. Anybody can be a rock and roll legend. Unquestioning acceptance of these four precepts guarantees listeners everlasting happiness in the Land of the El Caminos. Little hard to swallow? You're not alone. Despite their website's claims to the contrary, it's hard for me to conceive of Land of the El Caminos really getting off the ground in any context outside of a sports bar on a weekday night, where patrons are already so soused and heavily involved in watching The Game that the band's unfortunate sound fades into background noise. And perhaps Land of the El Caminos is aware of this. Maybe the title of their third album, Subourbon, pays homage to their barroom enthusiasts-- though to be perfectly honest, it seems that Land of the El Caminos fans would more likely be drinkers of Budweiser than Jim Beam. But why quibble? Well, because their sound quibbles with itself. In some sense, it's generic enough. Subourbon's first track, ""Slouching in My Spine,"" sounds a lot like Face to Face circa 1995, or some such power chord/machismo-heavy pop/punk. Except the verses are punctuated with these completely extraneous, wacked-out metal guitar solos, and the vocals are delivered by a mostly tone-deaf Eric Bachman impressionist whose overt adoration of the late Archers of Loaf is suggested even in the song's title. Now add some goofy production quality-- of the sparkling clean variety-- that does nothing so much as illustrate how awkward and distasteful this combination actually is. Presto! Subourbon. That being said, ""Slouching in my Spine"" is one of the album's best tracks. Namely because it doesn't involve clumsily handled keyboards-- like ""We Never Learned How"" which sounds a lot like ""Slouching in My Spine,"" except more like Archers of Loaf with a little Weezer thrown in for good measure-- or intense lyrical discomfort. But in the spirit of giving credit where credit is due, the lyrics to eight of the album's eleven songs are penned by Lara Fanelli (wife? sister of Dan?), who is not in the band. Her lyrics, though boring, are not bad. But when Dan goes it alone, the results are questionable at best. Consider the case of ""Heaven."" The song is preceded by the recitation of a haiku (I'm not kidding), and opens with the following: ""Heaven is where you spray everyone in the face with your love/ I'm never gonna see your face again/ And how could you sleep with that motherfucker?"" Clearly, in the gospel of the El Camino, the afterlife is envisioned in a wholly original light. Fanelli further elucidates on ""Rock Star Dream,"" a fairly straightforward Blink 182-ish ditty concerning ""a heaven so full of all that's beautiful,"" including ""guitar rock angels both big and small."" About the only thing I can say for Land of the El Caminos is that they're consistent in their odd hodgepodge of influences. Without the added effect of instrument and lyrical misfortune, the songs settle into a forgettable haze of mid-90s nostalgia and those old MTV buzz bin bands that sold CDs on the basis of one boring song and a colorful video. Does anyone remember Wax? I'm betting Land of the El Caminos hopes you do. Yet, there's something so sadly likeable about these guys. They're hard working, sincere, committed. They've put out three records on their own label, and you can imagine the high fives as they drive off to the next show. All the onstage banter about ""doing it for the kids,"" a complete lack of pretension mediated by their inability to even feign pretension, the good intentions... Perhaps one day the Land of the El Caminos will find their ideal audience. Some small segment of the population so amped up on pop/punk and Archers of Loaf. They'll fondly coalesce under the Land of the El Camino banner, following their heroes from barroom to barroom. And every night the band will pause for a moment of bliss, seeing heaven as their fans spray their faces with love. Bless their hearts.","Once upon a time, Dan Fanelli, Aaron Cleall, and Ken Wallin, three industrious lads from the suburbs of Chicago, set ...

Wasted Sunday,Ovuca,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2213d197565213aff5/1:1/w_160/6440aea0.jpg,2001-12-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6068-wasted-sunday/,Rephlex,"Ovuca, known to the Tooth Fairy as Aleksi Perälä, may have reached a steady state of coherence. Ovuca's previous releases have been scattershot blasts of intense drill-n-bass, piano interludes, flute warbles, and the like. Rephlex, it's seemed, would release anything Perälä commits to tape. But Wasted Sunday sees what is possibly the first time Perälä has handed over an entire album's worth of worthy material. Perälä has said that small critters that frequent a park nearby him inspired the sound of Wasted Sunday. Taking that oddball statement to be true-- big gulp of credulity-- squirrels, sparrows, earthworms, and sundry other varmints must not care for shredding beatcore techno or portentous piano solos à la Drukqs. Wasted Sunday provides all creatures with precise and happy, yet considered, IDM. It's time for zoologists to rework their calculations of squirrel IQ. Don't let the rodents have all the fun, though. There's no reason why creatures higher up the mammalian phylum shouldn't scamper friskily during the delightfully naïve ""Gas Bubbles"" or the all-too-brief Boards of Canada vs. Nobakazu Takemura clash ""Albert Questionmark."" ""Afternoon Girl"" situates the breakbeat electro of labelmate Kosmik Kommando in a perpetually twilit land where fawns frolic in a beautiful place out in the country. The brooding melodicism of ""Treetment"" could have partially redeemed Vespertine's ponderousness, had Björk press-ganged Perälä into her IDM battle squad. ""Innocent Pedestrain"" weaves a toytown rave tune and some harsh TB303 acid bubbles into a spacious serenity reminiscent of Akotcha's chill-out classic, ""Go Sub. That serenity ensures that all the hostility Ovuca's aggro-rave EP King Stacey incurred is dispelled in seventy minutes of leftfield chill. However, I very much doubt that Wasted Sunday marks a change in Rephlex's A&R; policy. With the forthcoming release of Cylob's rendition of ""What Shall We Do With a Drunken Sailor?"" the label appears intent on maintaining its maverick/maniac rep. Wasted Sunday may be a blip, but what a gorgeous blip it surely is. I'd like to upbraid Perälä on one detail, though. If this album is what he'd consider a wasted Sunday, he's not trying hard enough. I've always made a clear distinction between wasted and merely unproductive. I determine whether a day is unproductive when I fail to make any headway with my laundry or with the compilation of this year's Christmas card list. A day is wasted when I've fristered it away, pondering, say, whether there's any mileage in computational ceramics. If Perälä is being gauchely self-deprecating about this album, that's the only error I think any seasoned IDM'r could charge him with. But if not, and he knows he can do better, why waste a Sunday on creating simply pleasant music when you could be forging a masterpiece?","Ovuca, known to the Tooth Fairy as Aleksi Per\xE4l\xE4, may have reached a steady state\n\ of coherence ...

Check Engine,Check Engine,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a591b1335d7bf1698c1a/1:1/w_160/49e5130e.gif,2001-12-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1411-check-engine/,Southern,"Vocalists are in the privileged position within the common rock band structure. They have the unique ability to ruin an otherwise good band all by themselves. Don't agree? When's the last time you were downright annoyed by a guitarist, drummer or bassist-- not by their personality, but by their playing? Unless you subscribe to Bass Player magazine, I'm guessing this doesn't happen very often. The musicianship might be uninspired or mediocre, but rarely does it single-handedly ruin a band. Vocalists are another story all together. This is basically the situation between me and Check Engine's self-titled debut: enjoy the music, can hardly stand the lyrics and singing. It's like King Crimson all over again. Robert Fripp & Co. have never been able to find a suitable vocalist or lyricist. As a consequence, their two best albums are easily Red and Lark's Tongue in Aspic, two albums mostly devoid of lyrics. And actually, Check Engine's brand of ultra-precise, frenetic guitar noodling strongly suggests a heavy Crimson presence in the band's collective record stash. A lot of early Zappa, too; some of these melodies are straight off of Hot Rats. It's art-rock focused through the lens of late 70s post-punk. Before I get too far ahead of myself, I should mention that Check Engine is an offshoot of the Chicago-based math-rock band Sweep the Leg Johnny, featuring saxophonist/vocalist Steve Sostak and guitarist Chris Daly. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I would think this was Sweep the Leg Johnny. There are differences, but it's nothing too pronounced. Sostak's alto sax still holds major sway over the proceedings, but with two guitars and two singers going at it as well, there's enough happening in the high range to keep ears busy wandering down the interlocking melody lines as if in a garden of forking paths. That said, the rhythm section is Check Engine's real strength. After the first few times through this album, I found myself listening almost exclusively to the drums and bass. In terms of young rock drummers, Brian Wnukowski's drumming is the next best thing to the Dismemberment Plan's Joe Easley. And Wnukowski's way of interacting with bassist Paul Joyce is nothing short of exhilarating. Not that the other elements are all lace and frills, but after the first few seconds of the brief and blistering album opener, ""Where's my Social Worker?,"" it becomes apparent that Check Engine build their songs from the rhythm section up, which they are smart to do-- they know where their bread is buttered. It gives the music a visceral, gritty, and almost bluesy feel despite the fact that the guys seem incapable of playing in strict 4/4 time. Which, of course, brings us to the vocals. As I've said, they're not so hot. Try as I might, I just couldn't get around them. I mean, if you're going to be vague, at least use words that sound cool together. Lines like, ""An entire world waits/ In figures and lines/ For a graceless kind of lover,"" from ""She Asked Me Some Questions and I Answered Them,"" aren't very evocative. And, ""But there its advantages end/ Before we had any time to send any pictures of our game faces,"" from ""Don't Make Friends with Salad,"" is just plain clunky. (Strangely enough, I like the song titles a lot, but they seem to have little relation to the lyrics of each song. And yes, the latter title is a ""Simpsons"" reference in case you're wondering.) In effect, Check Engine has two lead singers-- one a little more lead than the other-- but they both sing with such over-the-top earnestness that it seems like they're trying to compensate for the plain bad lyrics (""But we really mean it!!!""). I'm sorry, but sheer force of will just isn't enough in this case. In the grand scheme of things, the lyrics and singing aren't as annoying on the same scale as, say, those of Enrique Iglesias, but they do heavily detract from an otherwise well conceived and executed collection of songs.","Vocalists are in the privileged position within the common rock band structure.

Haus de Snaus,Blectum from Blechdom,by: Daphne Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3079d034d5c69bf2d20/1:1/w_160/366ea58e.gif,2001-12-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/798-haus-de-snaus/,Tigerbeat6,"One of the questions people ask when they find out a friend is starting a new band is, ""Well, are you going to be a serious band or a jokey band?"" Somehow, this decision determines the fate of the project from day one. Add humor and you risk losing credibility or failing outright. Serious musicians might be boring, uninspired or just plain untalented, but at least they're not making butt jokes while they're at it. Yeah, there are novelty artists that do it right, but even while someone like Weird Al might even be considered a genius, it's rare to find anyone who's pulled a life lesson or greater sense of being from one of his songs. (Don't send me e-mail about if you have, please. I don't want to know you.) Furthermore, obscure is humor in the sub-genre of avant-garde electronic music, so stultifyingly number-happy with its fiendish grins lit only by the trusty Powerbook. And Blectum from Blechdom can sound like that-- several tracks on Haus de Snaus take the esoteric high road-- but there's something more to it. Kevin and Blevin Blectum (both girls, for the record) are confrontational, theatrical, and absurd. And somehow, these three elements augment their appeal, drawing Wesley Willis-weaned punk kids and icy digitalis alike to their records and shows. Haus de Snaus is a chronological compilation of the duo's debut EP Snauses and Mallards, and its successor De Snaunted House. A serious majority of Snauses and Mallards has a sucking and splatting quality to it, where one channel whoops to the other's tick, playing back and forth in the stereo field. Of these tracks, ""Shithole"" pulls out the harshest Kid606 trash-style sample of the whole album, which generally stays in the dark, tranquil nether-regions typically reserved for ambient Coil. The opening of De Snaunted Haus is a testament to Blectum from Blechdom's amazing growth. The first three tracks run together, distressed but with a sort of collage-oriented organization, like cut-up styles of White Noise or even the United States of America. This is when the whimsy, which lays low for the majority of Snauses and Mallards, takes full force. ""Going Postal (It Is the Right Time)"" combines a weird lounge-waltz with evil undercurrents and long-lost radio vocals. The tight seduction of ""Right Time, Right Place"" works from a stolen hip-hop beat as rather unmelodic blocks of sound bump against one another, brutalizing the rhythm as it pushes through the song. Then, terrifyingly enough, begin the skits. The Girls Blectum send their voices through pitch-scramblers and backwards reverb and take on roles of little boys, evil snauses and impatient mothers. Though not funny in the traditional sense, the pieces are strangely disturbing, especially placed between the lo-tech dance tracks that form the majority of the album. In lieu of Snauses' ambience comes mania-- frazzled tracks sway out of control, interspersed with funny-the-first-time tales of missing toes, bloody messes and angry mommies. The final track, ""In Case You Forget, We Talked on This Record,"" perhaps calls to critics wanting more from the mellow facelessness of Snauses and Mallards, and perhaps projects others' annoyance with the ""wasted"" album time devoted to the duo's rather mundane playacting. But if anything, Blectum from Blechdom show with this release that their growth isn't so much one of maturity as it is of a willingness to experiment; one of the two new bonus tracks tacked onto the end of Haus de Snaus, ""In Search of the Non-Stop Party Planet,"" goes Autechre just to say it can, sucking in light and space until finally collapsing into an all-out, digital breakdown. Though just a sampling of Blechdom's early material, Haus de Snaus does show a lot of promise for what the duo could eventually become. More recent works, like ""Always Frank,"" their contribution to the awesome Tigerbeat6, Inc. compilation, see them headed in a direction where their chaotic sense of humor melds perfectly with more updated electronics and even guitars. So while they're just a really good novelty band now, there could well be a time in the not-so-distant future that sees Kevin and Blevin making music as insane as their comic personas. And that will be a good day.","One of the questions people ask when they find out a friend is starting a new band is, ""Well, are ...

Mobius Fuse,Olivia Block,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30c9d034d5c69bf2d29/1:1/w_160/38576f30.gif,2001-12-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/803-mobius-fuse/,Sedimental,"It was about three years ago that I stopped wearing headphones. This event becomes slightly more meaningful when one takes into account that all my life I've had a constant need for music, the type which leads people to use words like ""unhealthy"" and ""obsessive."" I've always been that guy who just can't stand to be someplace where music isn't. I'm the one who makes a straightaway for the CD player or the turntable the moment he steps foot in a silent room, even if I'm only planning on staying for a minute or two. To this day, I'm shocked that the guy I shared a room with as a Freshman in college didn't stab me to death, as night after night I kept him awake, myself unable to sleep without the aid of my stereo. And yet, there came a point when I swore off carrying around Discmans and cassette players. This was around the same time that I heard Gastr Del Sol's Camoufleur. About six minutes into Camoufleur, as the first song nears to a close, the live percussion drops out. It's replaced with a recording of two girls lighting firecrackers in a field, but the switch is so seamless that the listener doesn't even notice until, as the song winds down, we hear an unidentified voice telling the girls that it's okay, they're only recording them blowing off firecrackers and not to stop. This had a profound effect on me. The idea that sounds could be music, too-- it was so simple that I'd missed it all along. My eyes newly opened, I shed my headphones and I began to notice the world of music that bombarded me with every step I took; the imperfect beats of rain dripping on metal, the roaring crescendo of an oncoming train, the chorus of car horns and voices that's borne from every city street. Not only did my view of the world change, but so too did my view of music. If all these wonderful sounds existed, then why did everyone insist on sticking so exclusively to guitars? It wasn't long after this that I would discover John Cage and find many of my suspicions confirmed. In a speech delivered at a convention of the Music Teachers National Association in 1957, Cage explained: ""In this new music, nothing takes place but sounds: those that are notated and those that are not. Those that are not notated appear in the written music as silences, opening the doors of the music to the sounds that happen to be in the environment."" He went on to compare his work to ""the glass houses of Mies van der Rohe [which] reflect their environment, presenting to the eye images of clouds, trees, or grass, according to the situation. ""There is,"" he concluded, ""no such thing as empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear."" Cage attempted to demonstrate such theories through pieces like ""4'33,"" which consisted of a musician sitting at a piano, playing absolutely nothing for four minutes and thirty-three seconds. Though dismissed by many as pretentious nonsense, there was a point to such exercises. Cage wanted his audience to realize that there was no such thing as silence. He wanted them to come to understand, just as he had, that the sounds inherent in the world around us-- particularly those we most often ignored-- were just as important as those we might normally associate with music. These very same precepts lie at the core of Olivia Block's Mobius Fuse. Block, a twenty-something living in Chicago, plays mastermind to music that makes equal use of live musicians, field recordings and minimal pops and crackles she calls ""lo-fi electronics."" More likely to lead a group of musicians from a table behind the audience, holding numbered cards beneath an office lamp to signify the beginning or end of different segments, than she is to play the traditional part of the conductor, hers is a unique mind. And with Mobius Fuse, it has given birth to something truly stunning. The first thing I noticed when I popped Mobius Fuse-- a 32 minute movement, the result of nearly three years of field recordings, musical sessions, and painstaking mixing-- into my CD player was... well, nothing. The record begins with silence. After about a minute, noise begins to seep in like red wine spilt on white fabric. Warm pops, like scratches on film, and almost-mute chirping that could just as easily be a distant recording of crickets or plain old feedback fill the air for about 40 seconds, before they disappear back into the foggy silence. This is a game Block plays with her listeners, manipulating many of her field recordings to the point where they still form an image, only it's a blurry one, its source often impossible to identify. When the sound reemerges, the warm pops are accompanied by the undeniable sound of crickets up close. But soon, this revelation, along with the sound, fades. For a half-hour more, a whole spectrum of sounds meander in and out. Some are field recordings. Some are electronic noise. Some are traditional instruments-- Block employs a six-horn ensemble (including well-known Chicago talent Jeb Bishop and Kyle Bruckmann) and sampled drums and cymbals. The horns sound lush as can be, though their tone varies little. The horns' part is so static for a couple of reasons. For one, the point here is not to create music, but to contrast sounds-- or better yet, to explore the ways in which all sounds are alike. But more importantly, complex horn arrangements would detract from all the other sonic nuggets Mobius Fuse has to offer. As it is, the horns are just another part of the mix, never threatening to overwhelm the other sounds, and allowing the samples to develop an emotional weight usually thought of as connected to so-called ""real instruments."" When Block presents us with a thunderstorm or the sound of firecrackers exploding, it's impossible to tell which sounds are from the recording and which are machine-made clicks. And by the time the horns bleed in for the last time, you'll have grown so used to hearing them right alongside wind, birds, bugs, ice and tape static, that you may not even register the change. But it's in the silence, every bit as much as the sound, that the true magic lies. It's in the waiting, the quiet meditative moments in between sonic spurts that come on like a rush of adrenaline, that so much of Mobius Fuse's beauty is hidden. Here, Block has assembled a deceivingly simple work of utmost subtlety. It's a work imbued with as much, if not more, emotion and complexity as anything released this year, but it will only reveal it to those listeners willing to dig far beyond the surface. In the 1950s, John Cage predicted that as experimental music (or ""structured sound,"" as he liked to call it) continued to develop, our musical language would change with it. Terms like ""resonance"" and ""discordance"" would no longer be relevant. Instead, he suggested, our conversations would consist of terms like ""music"" and ""non-music."" Mobius Fuse is one of the most unique listening experiences I've come across all year, largely because it so effectively melds these two sonic landscapes together, because it recognizes that there isn't all that much setting the two apart. And by letting these soundscapes fade-- not only in and out of one another, but in and out of sheer silence as well-- Olivia Block shows us that silence has every bit the ability to transform and transport as the most beautiful of sound.","It was about three years ago that I stopped wearing headphones.

Bavarian Fruit Bread,Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3539d034d5c69bf2dc1/1:1/w_160/3fd1deed.jpg,2001-12-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6996-bavarian-fruit-bread/,Sanctuary,"Mazzy Star was always a form of Hope Sandoval fetishism for me. Hearing ""Halah"" for the first time as a teenager in 1990, I was immediately seduced by Sandoval's detached feminine voice and the ethereal psychedelic folk that shimmered underneath. She Hangs Brightly and that waifish chanteuse were a perfect counterpoint to the masculine posturing of grunge. I should also admit that I'd begun to grow tired of the formula before Mazzy Star dissolved. Now, with Sandoval going solo but failing to veer from her same old signature sound, she seems less attractive than narcissistic. Conceit usually seems to coincide with a lack of ideas, and when the wellspring of inspiration runs dry, there's only one thing to lapse into: self-parody. Like all of Mazzy Star's releases, Bavarian Fruit Bread works well as a mood piece and makes good background music, but it doesn't reward close listening. Aside from a couple of tracks on the album, most of the songs here sound undeveloped and repetitive. Considering most of them only employ a sparse accompaniment without a proper rhythm section, it's odd that, after breaking with David Roback, Sandoval has matched herself with My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm O'Ciosig who has only been playing guitar for two years. This probably explains the simplicity of the arrangements. One of the highlights of the album is ""Suzanne,"" a pretty little ballad with tinkling glockenspiel accompaniment and some nice harmonica lines. Along with ""Drop"" and the half-realized ""Butterfly Morning,"" the first three tracks are a promising start, but from there things start to unravel. With a catchy psychedelic soul vamp and a sultry vocal flowing like dripping honey, the fourth song, ""On the Low,"" sounds like Booker T in space, or Dusty Springfield on acid-- it's seductive, but confused. For most of the track's duration, Sandoval seems tentative about where it all should lead, falling back on the rhythm section to carry things to completion. And most of Bavarian Fruit Bread is like this, the seeds of fine songs that frustratingly fail to completely deliver. There are the two short keyboard pieces, ""Baby Let Me"" and ""Bavarian Fruit Bread,"" that seem to make some kind of attempt at breaking new creative ground, but since they're little more than aimless noodling, they come off as extraneous interludes and add nothing to the course of the album. The same can be said of ""Feeling the Gaze."" The cello accompaniment is a gorgeous addition for a few notes, but no attempt is made to develop the basic six-and-five-note sequences that are strung together ad nauseam till you feel like busting the fucking thing against a wall. But then comes another gorgeous success. ""Charlotte"" is another delicate ballad with Sandoval actually making an attempt at some form of emotional expression. For all of the beauty of Sandoval's voice, she makes little effort to deviate from her usual placid, monotone delivery. There are few peaks or valleys, just syllables that slur or fade away, particularly on the non-acoustic tracks when she sounds either bored or stoned. Sandoval's pouting on ""Around My Smile"" is laid on a little thick, and the slurred vocals make the already opaque lyrics even more so. And when all is said and done, Bavarian Fruit Bread is just kind of boring. Sandoval doesn't add much to the Mazzy Star legacy she tries to perpetuate, and when she strays from that paradigm, she usually fails. The fetish is dead.","Mazzy Star was always a form of Hope Sandoval fetishism for me. Hearing ""Halah"" for the first time as a ...

Please translate these phrases from French into English. The answers are listed below. 1. Je n'ai pas compris un seul mot de ce qu'elle a dit.
2. Yngwie Malmsteen ne joue pas pour le groupe dans cet album.
3. Julie Doiron a pris des cours de chant avec l'ange Gabriel.
4. C'est definitivement meilleur que Jordy (Dur Dur d'etre Bebe).
5. Je m'excuse au cas ou vous etes Francais and si vous ne comprenez pas mon sarcasme.
6. Honnetement, Desormais est excellent et captivant. 1. Translation: ""I could not understand a damn word she was saying."" Like most high school French teachers, I don't actually speak French. Julie Doiron does, though. She began her career as bassist and singer for the well-regarded Canadian indie group Eric's Trip. Since the band split in 1996, Doiron has taken to releasing somber acoustic music, initially under the moniker Broken Girl, then later under her own name. Desormais is her first Francophonic release. 2. Translation: ""Yngwie Malmsteen played no part in making this album."" 80s shred-master Yngwie Malmsteen could probably play 1,000 distinct guitar harmonics before you could pick your nose. Doiron would be lucky to play 1,000 notes before her next album is released this spring-- she has a reputation for minimalist, acoustic compositions. On Desormais, the common denominator is sparse fingerpicking with little other accompaniment. The most captivating song on the album, ""Pour Toujours,"" begins this way, with Doiron gently but methodically plucking two-note intervals, sans back-up. Subdued samples gradually begin to pulse underneath the guitar. Later, a drum march enters the foreground and raises the song to its dramatic peak. The musical interplay is tremendous, but sadly, it ends too prematurely. I will gripe about this; Doiron is exceptional at establishing mood, but less adept at driving home climax-- her song structures sometimes lack finality. In essence, I feel like there's more ""there"" there. 3. Translation: ""Julie Doiron took voice lessons from the angel Gabriel."" Trite, I know, but it's true. Doiron's voice carries the album. Gentle and passionate, it forms the perfect complement to Doiron's minimalism. Without her expressive timbre, this would be above-average acoustic meditation. As is, however, it's enchanting. Furthermore, Doiron does a tasteful job adding harmony when the mood requires it, as on the fragile, compelling, ""Le Piano"" (which regrettably tails off just like ""Pour Toujours""). 4. Translation: ""This is definitely better than Jordy (It's So Tough to Be a Baby)."" French toddler Jordy LeMoine was four years old when he scored the international hit single ""It's So Tough to Be a Baby."" This has nothing at all to do with Julie Doiron-- she's not even French. But Jordy is, and he was four when he achieved pop stardom. With a song about being a fucking baby. French people, man. 5. Translation: ""I apologize if you are French and cannot understand my sarcasm."" I was feeling a little guilty for #4; sorry, Frenchfolks. Let's be friends. ""Pour le future J'espere etre Francais!"" 6. Translation: ""Honestly, this album is gorgeous and captivating."" Back to business: Julie Doiron has put together another beautiful album. It's neither groundbreaking nor incredible, but it's definitely one of those discs you'll be glad to own. Like for when you're in love with someone. Or when you just want to make someone think you're in love with them by adding a Doiron song to a mix tape. Or when you're on a couch and R Kelly just isn't cutting it for serious cuddle-time. Julie Doiron gets these ""cuddling"" references a lot. They're indeed accurate, but I think her music is more flexible. It would also sound good watching lovers walking through the autumn leaves, or laying on your back thinking about your lover, or falling to sleep with your lover still busy reading a book, or eating brunch with your lover, or trading some Bob Carlisle-style butterfly kisses with your lover. Or, conversely, gentle sex. It's your call.","Pop quiz! Please translate these phrases from French into English. The answers are listed below.

Grave Disorder,The Damned,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89013d197565213969f/1:1/w_160/35417902.jpg,2001-12-05 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2154-grave-disorder/,Nitro,"So for those of you who aren't familiar with them, the Damned are the band that beat the Sex Pistols to every punch in the late 70s, including being the first UK punk band to release an album. They never quite sank in with the rest of the punk movement, though, and thus, the Pistols have gone on to be heralded as the leaders of a revolution, whilst the Damned have spent the last 25 or so years milling about on the sidelines. Of course, the Damned never adhered to anything that could be called punk convention, instead preferring to let Vaudeville, goth and cartoonish melodrama to permeate their sound to the point where they became impossible to pigeonhole. I won't lie to you: the Damned's new album isn't very good. In fact, the Damned have only ever recorded a few albums that were-- for instance, their debut or 1979's Machine Gun Etiquette. The thing is, their new album is hard to recommend simply because the band is totally out of touch with what's gone on in the past few yeas in music. Point of fact is that the Damned's albums have never corresponded to their time periods or felt truly prescient. This I don't even necessarily consider bad-- it can be an asset in the right hands. However, nothing could make up for just how annoying these songs are. This album is stuffed full of little idiosyncrasies that quickly grate, and it's stuffed even fuller with some truly awful lyrics. You get to hear about buying a new Playstation on ""Song.com,"" which from the title alone should be held suspect. ""I'm just killing some time/ It's a fantasy crime,"" they sing on ""Thrill Kill"" in harmonies that wouldn't sound terribly out of place on a follow-up to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's ""Nature Trail to Hell (In 3-D)."" The album is naturally also packed with questionable musical decisions, like the crummy faux-operatics that open ""Absinthe."" ""Amen"" actually features some great backing harmonies and powerfully shifting chords over a strange bell arrangement in the chorus, but the guys can't stay focused long enough for it to develop into anything interesting. Instead, vocalist Dave Vanian (one of two founding Damned appearing here) intones ridiculously over-the-top spoken word bits and irritating vocal affectations. Likewise, the vibes and even some of the guitar work on ""The End of Time"" are great, but the chanting background vocals render the song a great deal more comical than it seems intended to be. This is followed by ""Obscene,"" which features a chanted chorus of harmonized Vanian's warbling ""Obscene! The Dream!"" and various other rhyming two-syllable words and phrases into an echo chamber (or more likely a reverb processor). One of the oddest moves on the album, though, is the coda to the aforementioned ""Amen."" The song fades back in with an instrumental passage featuring samples of the ocean, birds, and a woman saying, ""It's so simple. It's fast, it's free, it's easy."" Basically, it sounds like the band wanted to try their hand at modern electronica, but mistook it instead for new age with samples. Regardless, it sounds out of place even on an album that delights in covering as much territory as possible. Part of what surprised me about Grave Disorder, though, is just how good some of the music is in patches. If you can ignore the rotten gothic dirge ""Beauty of the Beast"" that closes the record, you might find yourself having some fun listening to this disc. Usually, there's at least one point in each song that grabs your attention and allows you to put aside the overarching goofiness for a few seconds. For one thing, the band still has a lot of energy, and new keyboardist Monty Oxy Moron's vintage sounds bring a lot to the band as well. The groove on opener ""Democracy"" is excellent, as is the underlying rhythm section on ""Thrill Kill."" Of course, those two songs bookend the moronic ""Song.com,"" which features everything from lyrics about surfing the web to half-assed Ventures-style riffs and shouts of ""surf's up!"" The analogy of surfing and surfing the web is so played out it's painful, but it's pretty apparent that the band aren't taking themselves seriously. Even so, novelty recordings don't have a long halflife, and by the second listen, the song grows extremely... well, bad. Overall, this Damned album isn't so crappy it steams, but it's hardly anything that anyone outside of the band's most hardcore fanbase has to hear. Part of the problem with reviewing a band like the Damned is that there are so few apt comparison points, and the band's history is so developed. Therefore, I'm rating the album based basically on how much I liked it, which, obviously, wasn't a whole lot. Ultimately, your time is probably better spent elsewhere.","So for those of you who aren't familiar with them, the Damned are the band that beat the Sex ...

The Headless Horseman Is a Preacher,Brando,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a380ea9e61561daa4cbc/1:1/w_160/11cf25fd.gif,2001-12-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/913-the-headless-horseman-is-a-preacher/,RecordheadSmokeylung,"Beatlesque, Bowie-ish, and Galaxie 500-like are the synonyms that most often get thrown at the wall of How to Describe Brando's Music. And while they stick for a second, in a moment they've begun to walk their way down to the floor like those creepy crawler 25¢ toys made from that hideous adhesive gummy-rubber stuff. In other words, they're close, but only useful insofar as Brando's sound is difficult to pin down. You can make do with the creepy crawler tags, but Brando's songs are a love-it-or-hate-it sonic Teflon that you owe it to yourself to hear. It's remarkable that a band that sounds as warm and fully integrated as Brando, in reality, has its core members scattered over an almost silly geographical expanse. Some live in Indiana-- the band's originally from Bloomington-- a couple of them call Chicago home, and one is raising a family in Brazil. Derek Richey's voice does indeed recall Bowie's more nasally moments. And Brando's songs do often detour into odd glam byways that their more despondent ""recorded in my mom's basement"" songs leave you ill-prepared to process. Which brings up another strange thing about the band from two continents: how album-like an album they've been able to put together out of so many disparate styles. The Headless Horseman is a Preacher opens with the title track, a short but pleasant electro-shoegazer introduction. ""The Fight Club Song"" follows with its unnerving vocal and guitar melodies, wavering synth lines, and drumming that sounds only barely more human than the Casio beats from the previous track. Neither song is stellar, but together, they lay the mood-foundation, for what comes after ""The Seed"" is distinctly songwriterly indie-pop with a splinter-like melody and scratchy but brilliant guitar chords. There's something-- and you may have guessed this by now-- weirdly, well, British about this band. ""The Seed,"" in particular, sounds like a grotesque and yet beautiful mix between the songcraft of Death Cab's Ben Gibbard and the Pale Saints. ""Theories of Division"" and ""Pilot of This Ship"" continue in much the same vein, the latter revealing Richey's Bowieisms a bit more obviously than before, and with more than an echo of post-Fab Four Lennon. ""Hold Me Mine"" shifts gears dramatically, with a sultry bass-driven feel that's sexy and slowly propulsive, until the spell is snapped by ""Leaving the Scene of the Crime"" with its Ringo snare rolls and ""Strawberry Fields"" background vocals. The album slumps with ""When in Rome,"" ""The Leaving of Aytech"" and ""Overtime,"" which bring out the glitter, platforms, and too-tight clothing, earning the band every unwanted Bowie comparison they ever got. Yet, these tracks are mediated through an undeniably American prism of soporific indie pop musical sensibility. The best thing that can be said about The Headless Horseman is a Preacher, other than that the first listens yield quite a few winners, is that repeated listens will reward the patient. Still, this is heavily moody, self-indulgent fare for wallowing in your own you-ness. Preferably with a succession of stiff drinks. Shelve the Spiders from Mars and your whole catalog of mid-to-late 90s fuzz-pop for a few days, and see if you can handle this strangely natural sounding hybrid of the two.","Beatlesque, Bowie-ish, and Galaxie 500-like are the synonyms that most often\n\ get thrown at the wall of How to ...

"Drugs, Sex and Discotheques",The Prima Donnas,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12dea9e61561daa472f/1:1/w_160/1e6cb294.jpg,2001-12-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6472-drugs-sex-and-discotheques/,Peek-A-Boo,"There are some who seem to believe that all good music must be born of suffering; that in order to turn out an album of any merit whatsoever, an artist must be either twitchy, crazy, lonely, dejected, or just plain fucking miserable. These are the same people who'll quickly dismiss anything that isn't ""serious"" as being ""childish,"" ""amateurish,"" or simply ""stupid."" It pretty much goes without saying that these people should be dragged from the corners in which they brood and brutally bludgeoned with tire irons. Granted, this is a rather extreme, not to mention labor-intensive, method of sorting out a few self-serious pricks. No, on second thought, I propose something new and different-- something to show all the quasi-intellectual gloom junkies out there that music can be really fun without being stupid or political or relevant. I propose that our sad little friends are dragged from the corners in which they brood, brutally bludgeoned with tire irons, and then given a copy of the now-defunct Prima Donnas' Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques. The Prima Donnas, a convivial half-parody of a keyboard-driven new wave ensemble, fronted by Otto Matik (who also records under the similarly ludicrous pseudoname Gene Defcon), are certainly not out to choke you with intellectualism; the fourteen tracks on Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques are all about cheesy fun. But the three gentlemen in the band manage to make so many brilliant nods to the sleaziest, cheesiest elements of new wave that the album functions wonderfully both as a piece of catchy retro fetishism and as a hilarious exaggeration of an already-hilarious era. There's a painstakingly elaborate story behind the Prima Donnas-- one that I won't bother getting into, but which involves English orphanages, Texan blues singers, and plenty of drug-induced comas. But the most immediately fripping facet of the Prima Donnas isn't their humor; it's their music. The first three tracks on here are energetic, mildly abrasive romps through the world of retro, synth-driven rock, with lead singer Otto's unique, nasal vocals cutting right through fuzzy keyboards. With ""Headfull of Pills,"" the band truly hits their stride, turning out one of the single most memorable songs I've heard all year. With slinky synths, an almost intolerably great melody, and strikingly funny lyrics, the song manages to be every bit as good as any song to come out of the era the Prima Donnas are sending up. Elsewhere on the album, things get a bit sketchy, as the band seems to get too wrapped up in their gimmick to concentrate on making focused music. ""F.U.K.,"" one of many songs on Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques to play up the fact that the Prima Donnas are ""British,"" borders on obnoxious. But entertaining moments like the softly spoken vocal interlude on ""Lavender Shakedown"" manage to bring up an album that might otherwise suffer from getting too wrapped up in its own concept. While some songwriting lapses prevent Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques from ever achieving actual greatness as an album, the consistent level of energy, humor, and fun (not to mention the inclusion of a single flat-out amazing song), makes this album immensely enjoyable. This album succeeds because, like the music it references, it embraces its gimmick with self-aware ridiculousness. Seriousness, after all, is often little more than a gimmick itself.","There are some who seem to believe that all good music must be born of suffering; that in order to ...

Twilight,The Handsome Family,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29f5e6ef95969320462/1:1/w_160/d1b70fc2.jpg,2001-12-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3726-twilight/,Carrot Top,"These are interesting times, so you'd expect that it'd be easy to find interesting music, too. If only it were that simple. Bands capable of carving out their own creative niche are either extremely rare or extremely elusive, and in a world where traditional values are juxtaposed against crass commercialization and challenged by advanced technologies, you'd expect to find plenty of cracks in the façade to exploit. The Handsome Family doesn't seem to have any problems locating them, which leads me to believe that they either have an extremely keen sense of the ironies lurking behind our modern lifestyles and value systems, or that most other bands just don't care to create intelligent music. I tend to believe the former. Brett and Rennie Sparks play on the kitsch of a beer commercial-- round 'em up, Americana sentimentality that serves as a base for the exquisitely skewed ruminations that flow from Rennie's pen. Tales of suicide, murder and madness float lazily over programmed Casio keyboard country-and-western rhythms. It has the feel of a truck stop karaoke bar, or a ""Prairie Home Companion"" broadcast from an old folks' home somewhere in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl. The lyrics, though, are something altogether different. The Handsomes usually concentrate on fashioning a mythological tableau of ordinary and forsaken characters, emphasizing the dark and brutal side of life in a way that recalls some of Nick Cave's work, but tempering it with a touch of humor that makes it all very unthreatening. Twilight also succeeds where their previous album, In the Air, often failed, by crafting a set of slowly evolving tracks that act as perfect vehicles for the duo's brand of story telling. Brett's delivery is slow and lumbersome, and soon enough, you find yourself easily wrapped into the tales these two tell. Twilight starts off in typical Handsome Family fashion with ""The Snow White Diner,"" the story of a woman who kills herself and her two children by driving into a frozen river, the singer watching the rescue crew and the gathering crowd from a diner as he eats his hash browns. Death is present, too, represented by two old women sitting nearby, eating liver and onions (and my mother always tried to convince me liver was good for me). You quickly get the idea with the Handsome Family that, despite the initial impression, you're not listening to ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds."" ""Passenger Pigeons"" is a beautiful, heart-breaking chronicle of grief that has to be one of the strongest songs I've heard all year. Rennie displays a lyrical gift I've found in very few songwriters and the artful economy of the words she uses here really disgusts me when I think of the millions Bernie Taupin's accumulated shoveling schlock while these two find themselves largely unrecognized (although I get a strange feeling they prefer it that way). And of course, there are other fantastic songs on the album, too. ""A Dark Eye"" and ""Peace in the Valley Once Again"" are imaginative ventures into the past and future that create a romantic idealization of nature that reminds me of some of Neil Young's more imaginative tracks on Rust Never Sleeps. ""A Dark Eye"" is an Appalachian fantasy that takes you through the singer's thoughts as he sits in his car in a parking lot: ""In that parking lot where a prairie once grew/ And through the tall grass the buffalo flew/ I heard something crying way down below/ Where sewer lines snake around Indian bones."" ""Peace in the Valley,"" meanwhile, writes the epitaph of urban sprawl in a visionary account of the disintegration of a shopping mall and western civilization: ""All the mirrors cracked in half when wild horses galloped past/ And morning doves built their nests on the escalator steps/ And there was peace in the valley once again."" ""Gravity"" is the mystical story of the fantasies of a mad blind man whose potatoes speak to him. ""The White Dog"" is a delusional account of nightmarish fear and paranoia. Do you see a theme here? There are some throwaway tracks on the album that I feel totally indifferent towards, and most of them are backed by Rennie's keyboard playing which at times leans toward campy. But you've got to understand the Handsome Family. Few other bands could give such a sympathetic catalog of deceased childhood pets as ""So Long"": ""So long to my dog Snickers who ate Christmas tinsel/ So long to Mr. Whiskers who jumped out of a window/ And to the family of gerbils who chewed out of their cage/ And to the little brown rabbit I ran over by mistake/ So long, so long, I'll see you on the other side.""","These are interesting times, so you'd expect that it'd be easy to find\n\ interesting music, too.

Whatever,Green VelvetPajo,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfa5c0084474cd0c3089/1:1/w_160/238f0eaf.gif,2001-12-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3571-whatever/,Music Man,"Green Velvet, tech-house's premier whackjob, is back from another strange realm. Previously, Green Velvet had regaled the world with his tales of being a toothless inbred victim of alien abduction who lost his anal virginity at the hands of his alien captors (""Abduction""), as well as Zoloft fantasies about being an immortal water molecule (""Water Molecule""). He's also previously made public ""Answering Machine,"" a week's worth of answering machine messages during the course of which he's dumped by his fiancée who's also pregnant by some other guy, his landlord is throwing him out on the street for the racket he makes, and his best friend has stolen his primo stash. No small wonder Green Velvet rages after each message, ""I can't take this shit."" ""Answering Machine"" was later remixed to big-room-buckling glory by edgy house masters, X-Press 2. For the follow-up to the 1999's Constant Chaos and the F-111 self-titled singles compilation, Green Velvet drops the chrome gleam of tech house and scoops up some filthy Teutonic electro-agit-punk. Never as distorted and slogan-slinging as Atari Teenage Riot, Whatever is assuredly aggro. Unlike the comfortably removed sci-fi of Constant Chaos, Whatever is altogether more down-to-earth and soiling. You don't have to be a skank to get off on this record, but if you are, it will assuredly assist your acclimatization to Green Velvet's funky ordure. After declaring that he's a genetic defect on ""Genedefekt,"" ""La La Land"" returns to the wanton haunts of naughty girls and boys that Green Velvet exposed on his 1995 debut single, ""Flash."" For his debut, Green Velvet took club kids' parents on guided tours of skeevy raves and encouraged the outraged, middle-aged delusionals to take photographs with the exhortation, ""Cameras ready! Prepare to Flash."" ""La La Land"" offers stern warnings about ""those little pills"" and the unreal ""thrills that they yield"" and the million brain cells that each pill kills. Underneath the manic preacher warnings, Green Velvet slides a demonic Euro electro track similar to the snarling crunky joints International Deejay Gigolos or Felix Da Housecat release. On ""Stranj,"" Green Velvet flips into a more Giorgio Moroder-derived, tech-trance mode for his exposition on how strange his world is after drugs and how his family is pressuring him to be an upstanding member of society, rather than the night-filth freak he really is. ""Sleepwalking"" is an earnest and heavily processed tribute to Cabaret Voltaire's 1985 masterpiece of the same name. Though Green Velvet adds his unique lyrics, everyone whose adored Cabaret Voltaire's song will love the spindly four-note melody figure and the cowbell breakdown. Green Velvet reserves most of his rage for ""GAT (The Great American Tragedy),"" which he defines as people's willingness to be told what to do. Green Velvet screams, ""They say it's a phase/ This is not a fucking phase,"" over a sympathetically militant searing gabba rhythm. Following the musical diary entry song, ""Waiting 4 the Day 2 End,"" in which Green Velvet informs us that he wanted grits with his salted scrambled eggs for breakfast that morning, ""Dank"" closes Whatever with Green Velvet portraying four reefer-jerks. Almost a cappella, ""Dank"" leaves the listener perplexed as to Green Velvet's no-narcotics sincerity. Since Green Velvet is a mask that musician Curtis Jones disguises his humanity in so that he can take long-stay excursions beyond the bizarre, no one should be surprised if they feel creeped out or sullied at the end of the album.","Green Velvet, tech-house's premier whackjob, is back from another strange realm.\n\ Previously, Green Velvet had regaled the world ...

What We Did,M. GiraD. Matz,by: Daphne Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf2b13d197565213b853/1:1/w_160/9544673c.gif,2001-12-04 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3455-what-we-did/,Young God,"A while ago I did this transcription of an Alan Licht interview where he talked about ""the old days"" and how New York City used to be dangerous, ugly, and full of vagrants, and therefore, also abound with strange and dark magic. In that city, so long over-run by snap-cap glamour kids with dad's Swiss bank account fueling their shoddy-art dreams, Michael Gira was a prince. His was mood unpredictable, his art was both serious and seriously disturbing, and it was either with extreme ecstasy or displeasure that audiences witnessed the violence, sound collage and glass-shattering vocals of his then-band Swans. While touring with Sonic Youth in the mid-80s, Thurston Moore commented that Swans were louder and more abrasive than they could ever be-- that they rather scared Moore & Co. and the rest of the audience. But while Moore's ensemble produced a linear progression of art-rock through the 80s and 90s, Gira's band traveled less predictable paths (from an MCA-fronted cover of Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" to the ambient side project Skin, which also featured fellow Swan, Jarboe) before finally disbanding in 1997 for the pursuit of separate interests. With the formation of Young God Records and the Angels of Light, Michael Gira's full-time, post-Swans musical project, a new era of the gloom-artist's career has come into view. Angels of Light have produced some of the most beautiful dark-folk on this side of the Atlantic, recalling more the manic stylings of Current 93 and Hood than the mid-90s phenomenon of depraved, unraveling folk on our shores (see Will Oldham, et al). Unsurprising, then, that Gira is still largely viewed as a goth artist, a label that somehow relegates him to the Projekt ghetto even as bands like the Faint fall in the public eye as ""new wave"" while uttering the most shopping mall-friendly witticisms this side of Trent Reznor. So it's a nice to see that What We Did comes labeled a ""pop"" album, with Dan Matz from Windsor for the Derby writing a majority of the lyrics and lending his Sam Prekop-inflected voice to Gira's two-chord symphonies. If it weren't for the trademark Young God packaging (digipack w/solid san-serif header and footer), it could easily pass for an early Drag City or Secretly Canadian release. Opener ""Packing the Locks"" hardly introduces so much as spills out the album with simple guitar lines and Matz's plaintive vocals withdrawing the jazz-turn affectations of Prekop and leaving the sensual breathiness. ""Is/Was"" takes up this slack, turning a borrowed blues melody (a la early Spiritualized) and stretching its pattern over long measures. Somewhere, the chorus ambiguously drifts in-- a trick employed often in the Gira camp-- as Matz's cigarette-torn vocals mesh with the back-up to form a series of drone lullabies. This reaches its peak on ""Sunflower,"" which mutates from oft-repeated chorus into chiming and scraping bliss-out in a way that mirrors the best moments of Songs: Ohia's Ghost Tropic. The closing track, ""The Brightest Star,"" almost sounds like a contemplative Ladybug Transistor slow-jam, all analog warmth and sweet, soaring harmonies buried deep in the mix. It's definitely pop-- and Matz's tendency to avoid emulating Gira's grim wails contributes to its accessibility-- but dirty pop (something N'Sync was never too convincing about). The rewards of this record aren't reaped through immediate digestibility, but through repeated suggestion. Still, this is by far the most palatable of Gira's growing mass of output and an indication of continued innovation in collaborating with those whose moods, ideas, and melodies augment his own dark brilliance.","A while ago I did this transcription of an Alan Licht interview where he talked about ""the old days"" and ...

Brain Killer,Brian Allen and Jacob Koller,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04fc0084474cd0bfb38/1:1/w_160/d56315db.gif,2001-12-03 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/117-brain-killer/,Braintone,"Indie jazz? Well, I guess it could work. Sure, why not? After decades of settling for heavyweights and cash cows like Miles Davis and John Coltrane, it's about time someone stepped up and shattered the status quo! Down with being force-fed, right? Okay, maybe not, but it was a nice idea. The thing is, I always sort of considered the great jazz commercial by default. It's not as if Miles pandered to the masses just because he recorded for Columbia, and the fact that he was signed by such a corporate entity may say more about the state of art and commerce forty years ago than about anything else. It's certainly not like that today. Sure, there are major jazz artists signed to big contracts by bigger labels (think the Marsalis clan, or Joshua Redman), but I've often wondered how this comes to be. From a label perspective, I can't imagine even the biggest names are bringing in too much capital, and that the biggest selling jazz (or some such) artists are people like Diana Krall and David Benoit says a lot. That's not a dis on D and D, but some rather depressing examples of what passes for jazz today among the greater record-buying public. So, maybe that is a dis, against big labels, D, D, and the public at large. Let me start over. Indie jazz. This is not a highfalutin' concept. It basically boils down to the fact that big labels aren't willing to take a chance on music, no matter how artistically satisfying and/or creative, if it doesn't stand to make money. So, rather than sit at home, waiting for these labels to change their minds, many artists resort to releasing their own music, taking full responsibility for its distribution and production, as well as pocketing almost all of the money it does make. John Zorn does it, Tim Berne does it, and Brian Allen and Jacob Koller do it. Brain Killer is their first album, and it goes without saying that you're probably never going to hear this stuff from a major. Brian Allen is a trombonist from Texas specializing in something similar to Zorn's postmodern take on jazz: that is, you'd be hard pressed to call it ""jazz,"" or anything else during a particular moment, but when you step back, dozens of genres become apparent. His classical training comes through in the clear tone and precision with which he executes the heads on these relatively short tunes. A sly pop influence comes through in his melodies, which owe as much to Cobain as they do Coltrane (though may have the most spiritual connection to Monk). And of course, the avant-garde is written all over this recording-- just try getting through the angular strains of something like ""The Unwelcome"" without trying to find references to Bela Bartok and Zorn buried in his liner notes. Pianist Koller seems to be coming at this music from a different angle. Although he's no less a style chameleon, I hear a tad more cinematic schizophrenia in his playing than in Allen's. What that means is that even though the two duet throughout the album, it often seems that a lot of the musical context is provided by Koller, as if he's creating the universe they exist in, and Allen is commenting, or perhaps just dancing around it. Koller wrote about half the tunes on Brain Killer, and after even a few listens, his pieces seem much less rooted in Allen's pop experimentation and closer to something from a surreal soundtrack. Idiosyncratic to say the least, and someone to watch out for in the future. ""Machines of Industry,"" for example, features lots of themes and dynamic changes, which in turn produces the illusion of textural development, and yet seems to be describing a scene or single idea. There are melodic phrases, but the piece doesn't seem so much a ""song"" as a tone poem. And when the two players go off the beaten path for the mid-section improv (free, as far as I can tell), the descriptive agenda remains intact. For me, one of the most impressive things about Koller's tunes is that, despite all manner of diversions and mood changes, the direction never seems to change. And when they're over, I feel like I've just been told a short story. I don't hear this kind of narrative in Allen's ""Bite,"" though there's no shortage of ideas. Again, it's the cut-'em-up aesthetic of bands like Naked City and Bloodcount that I hear most here, and whatever it lacks in classical construction (which may be the real difference in these musicians' writing styles) it more than makes up for in fearless playing and kinetic energy. The duo makes a complete turnaround with ""All the Rage,"" featuring a calm melody, but an eerie chord progression that makes it seem like paranoia is never far behind. Koller takes a solo midway through, and it would be almost loungy in its relatively peaceful phrasing but for persistently discordant interjections. Maurice Ravel meets Cecil Taylor? The albums ends with ""D.O.P."" which pulls out a few of the tricks presented earlier, but with a lower intensity, fooling me into thinking they'll end on a down note. Koller drops a seriously flighty note parade about five minutes in that leads to a furious coda wherein Allen doubles the piano's bass notes, and the effect is closer to Ruins or Don Caballero than any jazz I've heard. Afterwards, they launch a theme so rife with chaotic joy, I almost begin to wish they were a rock band so they could really hammer this stuff out. Allen and Koller are relatively unknown today, though it's not for lack of touring and performing with other musicians. I heard them in a club last month, and they're usually playing somewhere across the country. First, I'd wish anyone with a free night to go out and catch their show, because music like this usually sounds better live than Memorexed. Second, like most good music, the context is secondary to the artistry. Concepts like inspiration and creativity bleed through scenes and genres-- ""indie"" or not, these guys are for real.","Indie jazz? Well, I guess it could work. Sure, why not?

Eternal Combustion,Empire State,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc65ea9e61561daa747e/1:1/w_160/244fb6cc.jpg,2001-12-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2777-eternal-combustion/,Warm,"Athens, Georgia is the place to be if you're in the junk business. The tiny college town an hour east of Atlanta hosts a legion of musician-tinkerers eager to scrounge through junkyards and scrap-heaps looking for raw materials with which to build their elaborate noisemaking contraptions. Empire State-- comprised of brothers Jay and Tim Nackashi, who are also in Beekeeper, and Alex McManus, a sideman with Vic Chesnutt, Lambchop, and Simon Joyner-- is one such group of Athenian junk junkies, specializing in refurbished vintage keyboards and bizarre (-looking and -sounding) percussion devices. But they don't stop there, just throwing together throwing a bunch of other people's refuse and calling it a day. Instead, they actually write some pretty decent pop songs to go along with their mechanical inclinations, and for the most part, they successfully combine the two elements, and even throw in a healthy dose of electronics on top to keep things interesting. Sure, sometimes the combination sounds overly forced, and Empire State comes off as a little schizophrenic, seemingly unable to decide whether to be an indie rock band or an electronic group. But after listening to the handful of outright successes on Eternal Combustion, Empire State's second full-length release, it's easy to understand the band's indecision. Eternal Combustion starts off with the instrumental ""Soaked,"" which weds the seemingly disparate sounds of Pink Floyd's ""Welcome to the Machine"" with your standard trombone-driven Souza march, forming into a album intro that's hard to resist. This leads into ""Explode,"" which chronicles just that: emotionally cutting loose and raging against a immanently bleak future (""It's okay and it's alright to explode""). The song subtly hints at a theme that's spelled out in greater detail with ""Bugs in the System"" and the album's standout track, ""Bleeps and the Blips,"" namely the tension between Man and Machine. It's a theme that's underscored by the interplay between the electronic/mechanical aspects of the band and the more organic sounds played by traditional instruments. ""Bleeps and the Blips"" is the closest thing to an anthem you get with Eternal Combustion, and, ironically, one the least electronically enhanced songs on the album. On it, the band does their best Jayhawks impression without sounding too derivative, while McManus sings, ""All the seconds and sixths will make you crazy when your brain is squeezed like a sponge full of grease it's removing your memories."" Later, with ""Don't Disturb Us,"" Empire State strongly recall one of the bands that made technological alienation their stock and trade: Devo. The first time I heard this song, I actually checked the liner notes to see if it was a cover of a Devo song with which I wasn't familiar. It's a catchy, fast-paced synth romp that brings the album to a peak before its finale, the languid Beach Boys-meets-Smog ballad, ""A Final Day."" It'll be interesting to see what direction Empire State takes next-- whether they'll move toward strictly electronic territory or retreat back toward the kind of indie rock stuff they seem to have a mastery over already. Hopefully, they'll further deepen this middle road they've carved out, further blurring the seam between organic and electronic/mechanical, and keep digging around the back alleys of Athens for a hubcap that makes that specific sound they all hear in their heads.","Athens, Georgia is the place to be if you're in the junk business.

Pyramidi,Radioinactive,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f3c0084474cd0bff31/1:1/w_160/ba9899a8.jpg,2001-12-03 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6664-pyramidi/,Mush,"Radioinactive is a guy, not a group. He hails from Los Angeles, and dabbles in a genre he calls ""avant hip-hop."" ""Avant,"" in this context (as with most other indie usages of the word) is merely a euphemism. One may use the word as a synonym for ""cutting edge,"" as its technical definition is ""culturally or stylistically advanced."" But musically, ""avant"" has come to imply brazen abnormality over the years. Dumb the music down and it just becomes plain weird. So, in essence, Radioinactive makes ""weird hip-hop."" Or maybe one would do better just to call it weird, and forget the hip-hop part. But that wouldn't exactly be fair; if there's one thing I associate with hip-hop, it's the beats, and Radioinactive definitely has those. His beats fit the ""avant"" label, avoiding pop, funk or fusion samples-- hard break beats, horn sections and thumping, subterranean basslines make but a few appearances on Pyramidi. Instead, Radio culls samples from the nocturnal subcultures of the world; the title track placed me in a Moroccan brothel (supposing brothels exist in Morocco), ""Una Cosa"" in a smoky Havana nightclub, ""Childish"" on the weekend streets of Kingston. The dominant motif is darkness-- not anger or aggression, but a relaxed, cool musical presence. And as a contrast to most other hip-hop artists, I can't imagine hearing Radioinactive coming out of a Lincoln Navigator with deep dish rims, tinted windows and a dope ""system."" This stuff seems a little too exotic for the pimps and players. The rhymes are another matter. Radio has an interesting free-flowing, halfway-to-helium delivery that sometimes matches his beats, but at others sounds superfluous and distracts from the groove. His rambling writing style just lacks precision. It borders on free association, or some sort of partially calculated freestyle, and the loose approach, mixed with the tempo, results in enough words to fill a 20-page thesis. With so many lyrics, whatever message Radio wants to get across is severely diluted. There's an adage that says the best bassists ""know how to play the rests."" MCs aren't much different. Two of the best examples for any MC to learn from are Rakim and Kool G Rap. Like Radioinactive, each preferred to rap at quick tempos, but they excelled by knowing when to shut up and let the breaks take the foreground, or just resting on a beat to punctuate a lyric (""I can take a phrase that's rarely heard/ [pause]/ Flip it/ [pause]/ Now it's a daily word,"" from Rakim's ""Follow the Leader""). Radio doesn't play with dynamics enough, even when he's got a good beat to work with, like on the title track. Another example is the Arabian-flavored ""Before the Thought,"" where Radio gets stuck in a noticeable vocal cadence, which is odd, considering his rhymes and meter are rarely predictable. Fortunately, the backing track overpowers the unrelenting lyrical assault, making the song enjoyable regardless of its difficulties. Radioinactive is at his lyrical best on ""The Music,"" which is also one of the more traditional hip-hop tracks, and the one with the stiffest breakbeat. He sounds a lot like Del here, especially when he's varying his vocal inflection to deliver lyrics like, ""Down your sink/ Down your drain/ Found your brain underground/ With a plunger found right next to it/ Add some text to it/ Add some facts/ Ask your Dad for the keys and plan to never give them back."" Moments like these are not common enough on Pyramidi, and require patience to discover; the album spans 30 tracks and 71 minutes, including a good deal of random vignettes and minute-or-less musical interludes. It's nice to hear hip-hop that doesn't conjure too many memories of A Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr or Brand Nubian, as many underground artists do these days. But prescience and creativity give way to overkill and lack of execution on this one. If Radioinactive can clean up his act (maybe bury some of the waste in a Nevada mountainside or something), he has the potential to make some pretty wicked albums. This one might even be worth owning just for its distinctiveness.","Radioinactive is a guy, not a group. He hails from Los Angeles, and dabbles in a genre he calls ""avant ...

Sebastapol,Jay Farrar,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd555e6ef95969323034/1:1/w_160/057f0ffa.jpg,2001-12-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2998-sebastapol/,Artemis,"That Jay Farrar. You just can't quite keep track of him these days. First he leaves Jeff Tweedy and the rest of Uncle Tupelo to their own devices and forms Son Volt. And now he's abandoned Son Volt (for at least for a small spell) and has recorded an album entirely his own. While he has denied on at least one occasion that Son Volt has split, Sebastopol does not include the note: ""Jay Farrar appears courtesy of Warner Bros. Records."" From that, we can conclude that, much like blood brothers Wilco, Son Volt and Jay Farrar are no longer related to the world-domineering Warner Bros. conglomerate. But the fact that we have a solo record at all can be interpreted in a number of ways. Did Jay Farrar get bored with the straight-ahead, twanged roots rock of Son Volt? Did he become jealous of Wilco's experiments and oddball collaborations? Whatever the case may be, Sebastopol finds Farrar seeking new musical outlets to rejuvenate his limping song formula. He looks to nonstandard guitar tunings, drenches of keyboard, and even takes up the Indian drone instrument the tambura, with varying degrees of success. But as Sebastopol stands, it looks like Jay Farrar can't escape his past. At the base of this record is still Farrar's same slight drawl-tinged vocal style, backed by musical structures that haven't journeyed very far from the days of Uncle Tupelo. Yet, Sebastopol is easily one of the more exciting things Jay Farrar has done. Not to be upstaged by Jeff Tweedy's Jim O'Rourke collaboration, Farrar enlists Superchunk's Jon Wurster on drums and the Flaming Lips' Steven Drozd to cover everything from conventional keys to melodica (as well as backing vocals), who each appear on about a third of the record. ""Feel Free,"" the album's first track, opens with an organ line that collapses into a running drum track, fuzzy organ, and acoustic guitar. ""Turn off the nonprofit radio and let it all sink in,"" muses Farrar on the theme of living life to its fullest on a track whose production feels satisfyingly organic. Drodze's string-emulating keyboard and monotone striking bell on ""Damaged Son"" turn what originated as a typical Farrar acoustic number about optimism into a quasi-orchestral extravagance. Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, who once upon a time worked so well with Ryan Adams, appear on ""Barstow."" ""By the time we make it to Barstow/ We'll be more than half way to hell,"" laments Farrar, backed by Welch, over a tripping drum beat that transforms the standard country track into a standout. Rawlings' brooding lap steel resounds the cry of Welch's gorgeous coos in the bridge, rounding out a downright top-notch song that ranks among Farrar's best. Still, Sebastopol's 17 tracks and 50 minutes lack a consistency that would have made this record more notable. The three interludes are gratuitous, and two of these are downright annoying. ""Fortissimo Wah"" is 38 seconds of Farrar toying with a wah pedal on a single overdriven chord, while the 50 seconds of ""Equilibrium"" are just a series of glissandos on an electric guitar in an open tuning with a slide. The third ""Prelude (Make It Alright),"" introduces the tambura accompanied by a filtered, driving drum beat that cuts off unexpectedly, which on first-listen left me anxious for more. ""Make It Alright,"" coming three tracks after its prelude, reverts to classic acoustic Farrar, losing the filtered beat that emphasized the ride cymbal while keeping the drenches of tambura. When heard the second time on the full-length song, the tambura concept borders on sounding contrived. The tambura returns for the album's closing track, ""Vitamins,"" this time much less prominently in the mix and more effectively against the song's marching drums. And after the album fades out, one's view of Jay Farrar isn't all that different that when it began: the songs are pretty much the same, but the means have been slightly appended. While taking on an array of ornaments and guest musicians, Sebastopol's production keeps the record as a whole on the ground and emotionally accessible. It's commendable that Jay Farrar is seeking ways in which to reinvigorate his music, but he hasn't completely reinvented himself. Not that he must; Sebastopol is an enjoyable record. It just doesn't do much to change the popular conception that Farrar has his limits.","That Jay Farrar. You just can't quite keep track of him these days. First he leaves Jeff Tweedy and ...

At the Speed of Light of Day,Volta Do Mar,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96c9d034d5c69bf3c4d/1:1/w_160/64155e05.jpg,2001-12-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8487-at-the-speed-of-light-of-day/,Arborvitae,"We've seen our music come a long way in the last few decades. Could any of the original rock and rollers have foreseen the kind of advances their music would be subject to? It's not just that rock music sounds different now than when it began, but it seems the whole attitude of playing has changed. I've always read about the old rock music being borne of rebellion, and the kind of thing that united otherwise unrelated kids. But, after dozens of movements-- technological, conceptual and sometimes even cultural-- today, rock is almost irreparably diverse. Now, most people would say that's a good thing. I would agree with them, to the point that new music can never be bad, in the same way new information can never be bad. Fresh ideas are the symptom of a vital community, and to witness the expansion of rock's reach over its history is indeed inspiring. However, there is a price: chiefly, that when moving forward, often in direct opposition to that which is considered ""standard"" or ""traditional,"" sometimes good things get left behind. I won't hide my biases. I grew up on Beatles and Beach Boys. Whether I like it or not, I've come to expect certain things about music, such as cool melodies, interesting arrangements, and ace musicianship. This is not to say I don't appreciate inspired chaos, but unless I pick up on some inherent will to address (and not necessarily even emphasize) those ""classic"" characteristics, I'm wont to find the music lacking. And this is why Volta Do Mar's latest, At the Speed of Light of Day, is often disappointing. They aren't chaotic, and certainly aren't bad musicians, but something is missing. Chicago's Volta Do Mar play post-rock. Whatever your feeling for that terminology, it's now a perfectly legitimate generalization for music that might otherwise get lumped in with second-form prog. This is music that takes all the dexterity and kinetic flash of old-school progressive rock, but is usually not as over-the-top, extroverted or showy (bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor, Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky are exceptions to the rule). Unfortunately, it's often not as interesting, either. You see, my main issue with a band like Volta Do Mar is not that they're too intense and eclectic, but they aren't enough of those things. They don't have melodies. The tunes are long and complicated; not because there are lots of ideas being presented, but as far as I can tell, because the band stretches out their ideas too much, and there always comes a point where I wonder why they keep playing the same stuff over and over. Of course, there's a tradition for that, too. In rock, you need look no further than the original Krautrockers to find examples of how lengthy, repetitive music could be both ""progressive"" and ""rock,"" and yet not be ""progressive rock."" Maybe that's what Volta Do Mar is going for: some kind of synthesis of, say, Neu and Rush. It just seems that when bands try to combine these disparate influences, they often end up creating music that negates the best qualities of all of it. The album begins with ""The Sound of Day."" Guitarist Phil Taylor finger-picks some rather lovely figures on acoustic guitar, which is a nice change from the ultra-processed sounds post-rock bands usually opt for. Soon, an electric guitar enters with a repetitive figure, dissolving to tense jabs. Pounding toms and a deep bass crescendo to a point when the band implodes. Then, with the guitar still jabbing away in the distance, basses in both channels drop a few afterthoughts, and the acoustic guitar comes back. The whole thing is very atmospheric, like watching an oncoming rainstorm. A nice start. Afterwards comes ""7/1000,"" which tries to up the intensity level-- the volume has increased and the tempo is faster. Drummer Tony Ceraulo, excellent throughout, does his best to inject some life into the tune, which sounds mostly comprised of figures (but not ""riffs"") that are child to Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew's from Discipline-era King Crimson, but retain little of the direction of that music. It leads into the short ""Rock for Nations,"" which adds some straightforward rock groove to the mix. In each case, I could have used more prog and less post, as without real melodies, and lacking very much textural diversity, this stuff begins to get a tad monolithic. The band does kick it into a higher gear elsewhere, on ""Binary Penetration,"" which features some very aggressive drumming and guitar playing (though I still couldn't really call what Taylor is playing ""riffs""). However, at only 33 seconds in length, the fun is over before it really gets started. More typical is the following tune, ""Quiet Alley and Lonely Terrain,"" which manages to take a hard groove and interesting form and not do anything with them. I would like to say that the band are inventing a new kind of rock where none of the traditional characteristics matter anymore, but mostly I was just waiting for the introduction to be over, and the real song to start. The introduction turned out to be the whole song, and I was left waiting. I should mention that these guys (including duel bassists Mike Baldwin and Jeff Wojtysiak) all sound like excellent players. Again, the fact that they seemingly have so much raw material to work with makes this album a little disappointing. Believe me, I would kill to hear people taking old prog and Krautrock, and turning it into a brand of music that wouldn't necessarily be ""post"" anything, but something new and just as interesting. I'm guessing the members of Volta Do Mar listen to lots of great music. Hopefully, they'll take their passion for playing and transcend the genres to make something altogether inspiring. You never know, someone might compare tomorrow's rock to them.","We've seen our music come a long way in the last few decades. Could any of the original rock ...

Blue Screen Life,Pinback,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a078c0084474cd0bfbab/1:1/w_160/f6b4eb30.jpg,2001-12-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6298-blue-screen-life/,Ace Fu,"Did I miss something here? Is emo the next big thing? No? Then I'm totally stumped. How else can you explain so many excellent bands turning whiny all of a sudden? First Death Cab for Cutie, now Pinback. I swear, if the new Flaming Lips album so much as mentions heartbreak, I'm going to shoot myself. For the sake of total disclosure, I'll admit the following. There was a period of about six months when I was kind of into emo. Back then, those off-kilter repetitious chords meant enough to me that it didn't matter that they never changed. And something about the way the singers tried so for harmony but never quite made it hit me hard. And then, somewhere along the line, I grew up. Ambition supplanted self-loathing, and with each passing day I had less of a place for emo. I watched as, completely independent of my own musical evolution, the same thing happened to most of my friends. The days of pumping the volume and getting all cathartic to the Get Up Kids were gone. Nowadays when we hung out, we all kicked back in our La-Z-Boys, chillin' to Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto. This would seem to reflect a natural tendency. As one matures, so too does one's musical taste. Emo has its merits, and I'll even maintain that bands like Sunny Day Real Estate and the Weakerthans do it well, managing to milk more out of a generic formula than they rightfully should. But largely, emo remains cheap catharsis for teenaged middle-class white males-- the music snob's equivalent to rap-metal. Which is why I can't claim to understand Pinback's Blue Screen Life. Their 1998 self-titled debut was one of indie rock's finest hidden treasures. A collaboration between Three Mile Pilot's Armistead Burwell Smith IV (aka Zach) and Optiganally Yours/Thingy/Heavy Vegetable guy Rob Crow, it set lush guitar and synth to hip-hop beats, seamlessly incorporating scratched vinyl and a spattering of other sounds. Each song was a patchwork of four or five hooks that traded off, repeating and varying almost like a fugue. The vocals were gentle, like Sam Prekop singing a lullaby, which often betrayed their twisted lyrical content (one song in particular-- with the nicest, most melodic lyrics about pushing babies down staircases ever set to music-- sticks out in my head to this day). But on Blue Screen Life, the songwriting has devolved into straight-up formula, with most of the instrumentation that elevated the first missing as well. And, oh yeah, it happens to be decidedly emo. From the opening moments of ""Offline P.K.,"" you can tell something's wrong. The duo trades lyrical jabs, their disparate vocal parts sparring with each other in much the same way they did on their last record. Only these vocals are uncharacteristically abrasive. And in place of their usual musical intricacies are half-assed emo guitars which trade off between two riffs-- one jagged, one slightly less jagged, both boring-- for the duration of the song. The next track, ""Concrete Seconds,"" offers some hope at first. The lyrics tread dangerously close to sap (""Late at station/ Feeling all wound up/ Got to walk several blocks past you""), but the delivery redeems them. The duo trades off, one doing rapid-fire vocals over simple but pleasant Rentals-esque synths; the other countering with a mantra: ""Anything I say to you is gonna come out wrong anyway."" It's a pleasant track, until it reaches its bridge. Here, the vocals kick into a dead-on Jim Adkins impersonation, as Zach and Crow trade off moaning meaningless dreck like, ""Here in my house/ In no seconds/ Count the footsteps/ Count the seconds."" It ruins an otherwise good track, leaving a bitter taste in place of the pleasant melody that had dominated a minute earlier. This happens a lot on Blue Screen Life. ""X I Y,"" ""Prog,"" ""Tres"" and ""Your Sickness"" all have long, dragged-out, whiny vocals that sound a hell of a lot like Mr. Lucky Denver Mint. Not only is the sound unoriginal, but it also leaves me wondering: of all the people in our rich musical heritage that Zach and Crow could've ripped off, why the fuck would they choose Jimmy Eat World? Sure, there are songs that come closer to the sound that first endeared me to Pinback. ""Penelope"" is pretty nice, with Kings of Convenience-style acoustic guitar, a warm bassline, handclap percussion that grows more synthesized as the song progresses, and plenty of lush ooh-ahh's to fill in any lingering empty spots. ""West"" breaks the auditory mold for a few minutes, featuring piano, organ and accordion. And the vocals are... well, they're less whiny then most of what's on this disc. But ""Penelope"" just isn't enough and ""West"" still sounds tossed-off and uninspired, regardless of the instrumentation. The tendency is usually that bands, like listeners, grow out of the emo thing as they mature, but Pinback has got things all inverted. Yes, the musicianship is competent and-- unlike most bands that attempt this stuff-- Zach and Crow can actually sing. The production is sharper than before, too. But none of this nullifies the real problem here. Emo or not, the fact is, Blue Screen Life is fucking boring. Nothing really stands out; no moment grabs my attention. All the songs sound alike. Frankly, I wouldn't recommend this to fans of Hey Mercedes any more than I would to those who run screaming at the first mention of the word Kinsella. It seems sad to me that a perfectly good pop group would deliberately choose to emo-fy themselves, even though I concede that it's all just a matter of personal taste. But even sadder is a perfectly good pop group putting out an album as boring and uninspired as Blue Screen Life. Come on, guys, really.","Did I miss something here? Is emo the next big thing?

Sea to Shining Sea,Love as Laughter,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6f5e6ef9596932306c/1:1/w_160/e2cb77be.jpg,2001-12-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4878-sea-to-shining-sea/,Sub Pop,"Negotiating fad is a tricky business. What happens when your brand of fuzzed-out, retro garage rock catches major media attention? When similarly coifed Lou Reed fans are fitted for rotation on MTV? Are you awarded special regard for your prescience, or seen, erroneously or no, as cliché? Do you sink or swim? The predominance of critically acclaimed retro rock bands this year is an undeniable advantage to comparative veterans like Seattle's Love as Laughter. The smirking suggestions of stadium rock and bluesy, Jagger-esque swagger on Sea to Shining Sea ensures some success in a scene increasingly predominated by bands shedding their 90s no-pretense shtick in favor of rock star posturing. But Sea to Shining Sea is more than mere posturing. Sam Jayne and company have turned out a kick-ass record that's rock and roll in every sense of rock and roll. Produced by Unwound's Vern Rumsey and the ubiquitous Phil Ek, the record is a slick, skillful outing camouflaged in gritty, raw production. And Love as Laughter don't waste a second proving it. The opening track, ""Coast to Coast,"" builds from an adrenalized Who-like intro into what may be either one of the best tour songs I've ever heard, or the theme song to a potential Love as Laughter TV series, wherein ""like every band on the run/ [they] fight for noise and some fun."" In case you don't get the joke, sly allusions to classic rock mainstays are scattered throughout the album. The guitars in the hyperkinetic ode to paradise lost, ""Temptation Island,"" wink at Led Zeppelin. And ""Miss Direction,"" a bluesy Let It Bleed-inspired sing-along (and pun aside, among the album's best tracks), cleverly appropriates one of Paul Simon's most infamous lyrics. Some of the better moments deviate from the winking allusions to classic rock history. ""Sam Jayne = Dead,"" reputedly inspired by apocryphal bathroom graffiti at Sam Jayne's day job, has a gritty, off the cuff quality, informed by comparatively spare instrumentation and Jayne's unsettled vocals. Similarly, ""E.H.,"" the album's 10\xBD minute-long closer, builds on a comparatively simple melody with some nice guitar work and fervent vocal delivery. At its best, Sea to Shining Sea has a dusty, archival aspect; these are songs you'd expect to find hidden in some brilliant but forgotten rock and roll compendium, salvaged after twenty-five years of dust gathering from the backroom of an out of the way record store. There are a couple of misses along the way-- ""Drugachusetts,"" a psychedelic, Eastern-inspired jam, is ambitious, but it leans just a little too much toward kitsch, and ""French Heroin,"" a clumsy Sonic Youth impersonation, suffers as much from seeming essentially out of place on this album as it does from its general mediocrity-- but the accomplishment of the record as a whole largely cancels them out. The trendmongers and poster boys of 2001 may pass without comment as the next phase of rock revival rears its ugly head. That Sea to Shining Sea conforms to fad undermines its status as a great album, fashion be damned.","Negotiating fad is a tricky business.

The Revolt Against Tired Noises,Stratford 4,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a581ea9e61561daa515d/1:1/w_160/c0a1c82e.jpg,2001-12-02 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7527-the-revolt-against-tired-noises/,Jetset,"Everyone deserves an objective evaluation once in a while. By extension, the Stratford 4 also deserve an objective evaluation once in a while. It just so happens for the Stratford 4 that ""once in a while"" is right now. To assist me in my evaluation, I will employ the circa 1981-88 Fairfax County, Virginia elementary school report card. In the 1980s, Fairfax County report cards allowed for great flexibility and detail; abstract performance ratings for inter alia, attitude, ability and attentiveness supplemented the standard A-F for coursework, ranging from H (high achievement), to U (unsatisfactory), with S (satisfactory) and N (needs improvement) filling in the gaps. It's these abstract ratings that I find most appropriate for music, and which I will utilize here. Ready?  right now, I'm the one who matters, because I own your ass. Okay, that was a bit strong, but you get my point. A jewel case and liner notes can go a long way. Band Composition: H. Female bassist, female drummer. And better yet, the ladies are not just a novelty to draw horny teenage fans (although we're not ruling that possibility out-- if I had some damn liner notes, maybe I could tell you conclusively). One of these guys was also in an earlier incarnation of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, whatever that's worth to you. Sound: S. The Stratford 4 alternates between pop (""All Mistakes Are Mine""), noise-pop (""Displacer,"" ""Hydroplane"") and just plain noise (""Window Open,"" ""All That Damage""). The label pays mouth homage to the band by comparing their pop tendencies to the Velvet Underground and Yo La Tengo. For once, that's about right; it's all solid and well-executed, without sounding too much like either of the above. The noisier tunes include narcotic psychedelia, as on the bluesy ""Window Open,"" and more commonly, charged, ethereal guitars, like those that interject between verses on the lazy, sentimental indie-love number, ""Rebecca."" Songwriting: N. Great albums include one or two songs properly deemed Grade-A mix tape material. As far as I can tell, * The Revolt Against Tired Noises * has a few that come close (""Hydroplane"" is the best candidate), but none that quite reach the CD burner. In terms of pop, the songs could use a second-helping of catchiness, especially the melodies. The noisier numbers inch a little closer, especially ""Rebecca"" and ""All That Damage,"" but are not as gripping, affected or hypnotic as they probably could be. Fake British Accent: U. Assuming singer Chris Streng truly is from San Francisco, there is no need for this. Overall Performance: S. * The Revolt Against Tired Noises * is a pretty good album, and sounds like it would translate very well to a live show. With modest improvement and a little hard work, next time the Stratford 4 might be looking at an H. Have a fun summer.","Everyone deserves an objective evaluation once in a while.

Beat 'Em Up,Iggy Pop,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ebc0084474cd0bfcb5/1:1/w_160/5f3cdbf7.jpg,2001-11-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6408-beat-em-up/,Virgin,"I've never understood the Cult of Iggy. The Stooges records I've heard sound pretty good-- kind of a rougher, more driving version of what the Stones were doing in the early 70s-- and I like the highlights from his solo career. But I never felt the scrape of the edge Pop was said to possess. His mystique has always escaped me. Like many aging legends from the classic rock era, Iggy has struggled to maintain his dignity while mixing it up in what is essentially a young man's game. 1999's Avenue B was a detour that found Pop ditching the harder stuff in favor of a restrained and reflective approach, with some pretty damn spotty results. Reversing field, the more abrasive Beat 'Em Up is Iggy's attempt to put some cut back in his strut. Well, looks like time for Plan C. Record clubs like Columbia and BMG figure out which catalog to send you by asking you to indicate which kind of music you like when you submit your application. As I recall, one of the options is always ""Hard Rock."" The sound of Beat 'Em Up is quintessential ""Hard Rock,"" which means it lacks the stones to go for genuine heaviness, but is equally afraid to incorporate any hint of femininity. The result is an extremely bland middle ground perfect for cultivating Don Dokkens. In the center of Beat 'Em Up's tepid hard rock pudding is James Newell Osterberg, loudly complaining about everything under the sun. People in L.A. are licking ass. The music industry is full of weasels. Irony has displaced soul. The title of the album's 13th track sums it up nicely: ""It's All Shit."" His cantankerous ways would be tolerable if Iggy had anything original or interesting to say, but he can manage only cliché. The chorus of ""The Jerk"" ascends with, ""His brain is full of dirt,"" and then comes back down with, ""That's why the guy's a jerk."" The song ""Football"" finds Iggy using the gridiron as a metaphor for life: ""I'm a football, baby/ Going around the field/ I've been passed and fumbled."" Sacked for a 25-yard loss is more like it. The melodies, the riffs, it's all third-rate bar band stuff. But Iggy's curmudgeonly persona is the real turn-off on Beat 'Em Up. If Jack Lemmon had been able to hold on for a few more months, he could have teamed with Pop to make Even Grumpier Old Men. To each his own, but I can't understand why anyone would want to worship the Walter Matthau of rock 'n' roll.","I've never understood the Cult of Iggy.

Decline of Day,20 Minute Loop,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8425e6ef9596932117e/1:1/w_160/e8187b99.gif,2001-11-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8205-decline-of-day/,Fortune,"I know it, and you know it. Quirky, after many years of misuse and abuse, has become a dirty word, and an even dirtier songwriting approach. And that's simply because, to be quirky today is to try to be quirky-- to desperately seek to be off-kilter and innovative, and often, to toe some quasi-philosophical aesthetic line, with the ultimate goal of making a lasting impression on the listener's mind. Unfortunately, quirk usually comes gloved so thick in irony and contrivance as to render its core components devoid of sincerity. Which is why I will abstain from using the word again in this review. 20 Minute Loop is one of the more refreshing musical experiences I've had in months and months. Decline of Day practically begs for stupid music review fantasy hybrid-type descriptions. So here goes: say you've got XTC. Now subtract the TC, and pair the remainder of John Doe and Exene Cervenka with J. Robbins in a six-by-six cell haunted by Frank Black's muse, with only a Radiohead CD, a Flannery O'Connor novel, and occasional visits from the members of Seely to break the psychosis. This San Francisco quintet sounds like they should be from Georgia, not from the land of tech-sector meltdowns and hippie nostalgia shops. But then again, nothing much makes sense with 20 Minute Loop. And we don't have to travel far to prove the point. ""Jubilation,"" the sinister carnival-pop opener, couples stomach-achy, saccharine sing-songiness with stomach-turning lyrical surrealism. It pays to quote at length: ""Bracketed diamonds, billowing smoke/ A terrible heft, behind that pitchfork/ A torn up napkin, uneaten meat/ A bloody steak knife, bunions cut off the feet/ A crippled Arab, face in the street/ Searching the asphalt for her missing teeth."" Yuck to the lyrics, but yum to the unbelievable melody and the slick harmonizing of Kelly Atkins and Greg Giles. ""Moses"" follows, parting the Red Sea of wack, uninspired indie-pop songwriting with beautiful melodic interplay that recalls the more playful moments of Burning Airlines, only enriched with a feminine presence that was always so sorely wanting in that band's macho compositions. ""All Manner"" brings a solid pop hammer down on whatever reservations or resistance you might still be harboring. My favorite track, it uses mind-blowingly good harmonies and just plain pretty music to tell the creepy story of an unlucky couple's drive through the country. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, and the ill-fated lovers find their car interred in a snowdrift. As their minds and heart-rates slow to a still, they contemplate their icy preservation and lament the eventuality of their bodies being discovered ""later in the Spring thaw."" Their dying wish: ""Let us stay like this forever, once and for all."" Don't roll your eyes, motherfucker. ""Daughter's Down"" showcases Greg Giles' obvious affinity and talent for weird, chromatic vocal lines. Again, a melody that's damned near impossible to dislodge from your consciousness is wrapped around grotesque subject matter: this time, an incestuous father-daughter relationship. ""Pilot Light"" constitutes just another bomb-blast in the relentless melodic attack. The musical break in the oddly timed chorus features a mind-bending keyboard melody, and the second ""chorus"" (which in no way resembles the first) has Kelly Atkins sounding like the B-52's Kate Pierson. When, you ask, does it stop? I mean, they have to foul things up eventually, right? Well, no, not quite yet. The album's title track, in a just universe, would be a pop-radio staple, and would buy these deserving characters financial security and mass adoration. But as W is wont to say, the world is full of iniquity, evil-doers and legions of poor dupes with shit taste. Nevertheless, this track is pure gold. The lyrics are all Kelly Atkins, and are arguably, in their straightforwardly way, the album's best: ""I can lie here for hours while you breathe/ Indulging my doubts/ All the dreams that escape you come to me/ And burn themselves out/ I am hanging from threads that/ To the hands of the Fates/ They have dressed me in a pale jealousy/ And left me to wait/ And in the morning we won't remember/ Why we're finessing a way of keeping each other down/ We'll stay up all night/ It's force of habit/ And that's not how it ought to be."" ""Mechanical Angels"" is the album's last slice of perfection before sliding into merely ""good"" territory. It begins with lullaby-- soft-picked, guitar arpeggios that break into a chorus of inexplicable do-do-do's that out anything Frank Black has done in the past decade. The album's remaining five tracks range from memorable (the dreamy, but dirge-like ""Elephant"") to just okay-but-not-so-memorable (the Dumbek-adorned ""Mompha Termina""). Still, even if you were to cut out the final five, the first magically good seven tracks are worth as much as the last ten releases you thought were good combined. It's been a while since I thought I could only do an album a disservice by trying to describe it. What else can I say?","I know it, and you know it.

In the Wire EP,Friends of Dean Martinez,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be30eb335119a49ed014/1:1/w_160/dbb81929.gif,2001-11-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3203-in-the-wire-ep/,Grey Flat,"Though I'm not sure if these songs were recorded for a scrapped movie project, it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that Tim Burton employed Friends of Dean Martinez to write the soundtrack for some failed attempt at a spaghetti western. The songs seem destined for such a film, what with their ghostly translations of peremptorily Western themes. And if the idea of owning something so unmistakably leftfield appeals to you, you'll probably love In the Wire. If not, then go spend your money on something less eclectic like the Strokes. Okay, the Burton thing was a bad analogy but that doesn't change the quality of these four songs, available only on this limited edition release of two 45s. I don't know whether flipping the record after every track is supposed to make listening a more interactive experience or if it's just an unforeseen hassle that helped contribute to the medium's demise, but it actually helps the flow of the EP rather than hindering it. The more macabre pieces-- including the title number-- can be conveniently found on the first record, whereas the second features more formulaic country-inspired tunes. Such a contrast in style usually implies a lack of sonic direction, but one Friends of Dean Martinez's traits is the ability to infuse their characteristic sound with any genre that crosses their path. The slide guitar still sounds like an amalgamation of Ennio Morricone and David Gilmour (circa Meddle), and the band still has an affinity for ethereal reverb. Yet, there are definite signs of progress littered throughout this collection. Such is the case with ""Main Theme,"" which features some of the most complex arrangements to ever grace a Friends release. Dave Lachance and Brad Fordham have evolved from an ample rhythm section backing the interwoven guitar play of Mike Semple and Bill Elm to versatile contributors responsible for some truly stellar dynamics. Over the years, Elm and Semple seem to have made a few discoveries in their ever-constant pursuit of ""subtlety,"" a long, elusive attribute that, when achieved, greatly increases the effectiveness of their work. And periodically, the band relies on gentle flourishes of mellotron or organ rather than the typical slide guitar frenzy that's commonly found at the center of the group's efforts. The songs are a little more raw this time around, though not drastically enough to estrange long-time fans. Rather, Friends of Dean Martinez appear to be rationally developing the more experimental methods of sculpting noise they introduced on Atardecer while preserving the sound of a band playing live. On the EP's title cut, they succeed by adding tinges of psychedelia to their instrumental lamentations. Elsewhere, on ""Wichita Lineman,"" the orchestration offers more diversity than on previous excursions. In this modern resurgence of instrumental bands tentatively titled ""post-rock,"" it's hard to retain an individual style while still flirting with new, unexampled recipes for songwriting. It's good to know that Friends of Dean Martinez are past the stage of dipping their toes in the water and are on their way to realizing their full potential.","Though I'm not sure if these songs were recorded for a scrapped movie project, it wouldn't surprise me ...

The miserable thing winds up spending so much time showing off its incredible new talent that it forgets to do the simple things-- like eat out of a bowl and not shit on the rug. Hopeless and frustrated, you find yourself with no choice but to take a rusty kitchen knife to Fido, ending both his misery and yours. After hearing Papa M's Sings EP earlier this year, I couldn't shake the fear that I would at some point find myself cleaning David Pajo's diced innards off of my living room floor. After spending years with sonic adventurers like Slint and Tortoise, and working with such unique voices as Will Oldham, Pajo happened upon the miraculous discovery that he can play dusty old folk music. Unfortunately, those old blues and country records seemed to have wiped clean all that Pajo had learned in his travels, leaving him sounding painfully amateurish for a guy who wanted to sound like a weathered wanderer. He was an old dog trying to learn an older trick, and I for one feared that it would be his last. Thankfully, it appears that I won't be gutting David Pajo with a crowbar any time soon. Whatever, Mortal is a wonderful synthesis of Pajo's old and new tricks, and one of those rare albums that manages to be seriously steeped in tradition without being trite and boring. In some ways, Whatever, Mortal picks up where Sings left off: with Pajo trying his hand at some roots music, and putting his uncertain baritone to good use. But whereas Sings seemed little more than a genre exercise, Whatever, Mortal sees Pajo beginning to develop his own distinctive sound-- a kind of slapped-together orchestral feel that lends the album a beautifully downcast grandiosity. With Pajo, Tara Jane O'Neil, and Will Oldham covering a variety of instruments, ranging from guitars and melodicas to wood floors and dog tags, Whatever, Mortal is a magnificently rich-sounding album. Whereas lesser artists might get carried away with such vast instrumentation, Pajo keeps this album beautifully thin and airy. Take, for example, the album's opener, ""Over Jordan,"" in which Pajo's voice is often accompanied by little more than guitar and banjo. The cold, dark tone of the song's verse is contrasted by its gorgeous ""I'm going hoooooome"" chorus, in which Pajo's multitracked voice seems to melt into something beautifully malleable. What could have been the album's most sparse, revealing moment comes with ""Sorrow Reigns,"" a brief song in which Pajo is accompanied only by his acoustic guitar. But one of Whatever, Mortal's strengths is that, while parts of it are deeply affecting, the album never takes itself seriously. And on ""Sorrow Reigns,"" Pajo makes this abundantly clear, letting loose the Oldham-esque lyric, ""There was something like a wall between us/ That stopped your going down on my penis."" There's a serious tradeoff here-- the break in the album's somewhat-serious façade (which is already cracked by the album's title) is welcome, but the lyric sounds painfully out-of-place, and frankly, kind of dumb. A better executed bit of goofing off comes with the album's next track, ""Krusty,"" a lovely instrumental set over the backdrop of an episode of ""The Simpsons"" (Episode #9F13, ""I Love Lisa,"" for those of you who still find the phrase ""worst episode ever"" amusing.) Here, Pajo shows that, while he may be pursuing a folkier side, he still has some great guitar-based instrumental music in him. ""Krusty"" is immediately followed up by Whatever, Mortal's strongest track, ""The Lass of Roch Royal,"" in which Pajo manages to bring great sonic ingenuity to musical and lyrical themes that have been around for centuries. Using some wonderfully placed ethereal background vocals, a sample of rain, and what could either be keys or the aforementioned dog tags, Pajo constructs a sonic approximation of spooky sorrow that seems infinitely more substantial than just an acoustic guitar and voice. So it seems that David Pajo hasn't lost his way after all. Quite the contrary, in fact; he's managed to produce his best album yet. By not strictly adhering to the various molds of old-time folk, blues, and country, Pajo has captured the essence of the music he once shallowly emulated. What's more, he's managed to turn it into something that's unquestionably his own. Good Pajo.","Contrary to popular wisdom, you can teach an old dog new tricks.

Bright Flight,Silver Jews,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4055e6ef9596932078c/1:1/w_160/a1067e16.jpg,2001-11-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7161-bright-flight/,Drag City,"As the story goes, the first time Carl Sandburg visited Carl Sandburg High School in his home state of Illinois he was mistaken for a bum off the street and promptly ordered to leave the premises. School officials quickly learned their mistake and all sorts of ass-kissing inevitably ensued. Sandburg, it is said, was gracious and extremely considerate through the whole thing. Now whether this story is apocryphal or not I'm not sure, but it illustrates a couple of points: 1) most of the time, style rules over substance, and 2) poets don't really seem to give a shit. These days, style is everything, and since the introduction of MTV, the situation in the music business has only deteriorated further with each passing year. I'm convinced that if Janis Joplin were born twenty-five years later, she'd be stuck working in a Waffle House somewhere off of I-75. Of course, if you're a poet, none of that matters to you-- hardly anybody reads your stuff anyway, and if you also happen to be a musician on the side, well, either people like you or they don't. At least that's the way Dave Berman seems to see things. The Silver Jews have just released Bright Flight, the follow-up to 1998's great American Water. Berman moved to Nashville to record Bright Flight, and the influence is apparent throughout the entire album. He's absorbed the local country and alt-country scene, and integrated it with his own wry, lo-fi aesthetic to kick out ten new tracks of intelligent backwoods swagger. Stephen Malkmus doesn't appear on the album so the sense of comradery that gave American Water so much life isn't here, and consequently, Bright Flight sounds like more of a personal statement, mixing the cathartic grandeur of ""Tonight's the Night"" with the striking imagery of early modernist poetry. Berman is a writer, first and foremost, who happens to write music, but doesn't enjoy touring to promote it. As a result, the Jews don't go out of their way to impress anyone. It's this easy-going amiability combined with their frontman's erudition that makes them so affecting. ""When God was young, he made the wind and the sun/ Since then, it's been a slow education,"" kicks off the album, and it's typical of the types of musings scattered through all of the Silver Jews' records. ""Slow Education"" is loose, imbued with steel guitar and country rock wistfulness, and it also introduces Cassie Marrett as a doubling voice on the choruses, who graces Berman's deadpan delivery. Sounding a little green, she also backs and sings a verse of ""Tennessee,"" serving the part of Nicolette Larson to Neil Young, or Emmylou Harris to Bob Dylan. Much of the rest of the album continues in the same vein, only departing for the disappointing guitar romp ""Transylvania Blues"" (which can't match Malkmus' showpiece, ""Night Society,"" from the last album) and the boisterous ""Let's Not and Say We Did."" Bright Flight has some great moments, and two tracks in particular form the heart of the album. ""I Remember Me,"" a black Edgar Lee Masters-style American vignette that manages to describe a young love born (""The moon was worn just slightly on the right, they slow danced so the needle wouldn't skip""), lost during a coma (""On the bank of the road 'neath the cottonwoods, he turned to her to ask if she'd marry him when a runaway truck hit him where he stood""), and finally remembered (""He bought a little land with the money from the settlement and even bought the truck that had hit him that day. He touched the part where the metal was bent""). Berman even throws in the striking line, ""A black hawk nailed to the sky/ And the tape hiss from the trees,"" to sweeten the deal. ""Time Will Break the World,"" with its snarling, repeated refrain (""All my poor hungry children"") chills in a way a lesser band like Sixteen Horsepower could never pull off. The song is filled with feverish feedback and apocalyptic visions: ""Tanning beds explode with rich women inside"" and ""The icicles are dripping like the whole house is weeping on an evil little car with gull-wing doors. And I have no idea what drives you mister, but I've killed you in my mind so many times before."" It's a powerful song that I played probably twenty times during the first two days I had the record. Now that we Pavement fans can't look forward to any more of that band's albums, Silver Jews and Stephen Malkmus releases are the biggest events of the year. Here's to hoping we don't have to wait so long for the next revelation. But if Dave Berman prefers to concentrate on his poetry, I don't have much advice to offer except, if you do happen to have a high school named after you, for god's sake Dave, at least wear a tie when you visit.","As the story goes, the first time Carl Sandburg visited Carl Sandburg High School in his home state of Illinois ...

Pretty Together,Sloan,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45c9d034d5c69bf3053/1:1/w_160/90427314.jpg,2001-11-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7246-pretty-together/,Murder,"Sometimes writing music reviews sucks. No, really. I mean, the occasional free CDs are nice, and the exposure to hundreds of different artists is great, but there are times when putting the pen to the paper (figuratively speaking, anyway) is a real chore. I find that it's hardest for me when I don't have much nice to say. Believe it or not, not all critics relish the moment when they get to tear a band's latest album limb from limb. For this review, I find myself in a particularly undesirable situation. You see, I really like Sloan. They're a great band. Their last three albums were sparkling jewels in the power-pop coal mine of the 1990s. The quartet rebounded from a botched deal with Geffen in the early 90s to become one of Canada's most popular bands, founding their own successful label in the process. Of course, the political nature of the music business has kept their music criminally hidden from American ears, but that's beside the point right now. I'm here to talk about Sloan's sixth album, Pretty Together. As the rating at the top of the page suggests, it's not a terrible album by any means, but I'm really not all that thrilled with it. After 1999's amazing Between the Bridges, I was expecting nothing short of the best pop album of the year from these guys, and, suffice to say they haven't delivered it. Perhaps that's not really fair, but I'll start actually talking about the album now by stating my biggest disappointment. Sloan can rock. I know they can, I've heard it. So why is it that when they attempt to rock out on Pretty Together that they consistently fall flat? Three of the album's thirteen songs are big, riff-driven stompers that go absolutely nowhere-- the first time I've ever heard three clunkers on a Sloan album. ""If It Feels Good Do it"" opens the album, declaring, ""This song is dedicated to you, because this song is for people who know what rock is about!"" From that shaky ground, it proceeds to make a clever musical reference to Aerosmith's ""Back in the Saddle"" before launching into a vaguely familiar, fuzzy riff. The chorus is catchy enough, but Brenndan McGuire's production suffers an unusual lapse, allowing the vocal break in the middle of the song to get terribly muddy. From there, the song doesn't really go anywhere else, either, instead slowing to a sludgy ending. The song's two hard-rocking counterparts, ""Never Seeing the Ground for the Sky"" and ""Pick It Up and Dial It"" are similarly muddled. ""Pick It Up"" doesn't even have much of a melody, opting instead for awkward rock and roll posturing and dragging the labored riffing out well beyond the song's viable running time. ""Never Seeing the Ground"" stumbles along on pounding, disjointed blues riffs and also fails to deliver melodically. After the first verse, the sing-speak just gets annoying. The good news, of course, is that there are ten other songs on the album, and while a few of them aren't quite up to Sloan's usual standard, there are some especially impressive highlights. One of the things I've always liked about Sloan is the fact that the band is comprised of four skilled songwriters who each possess a distinctive melodic voice. Their democratic approach has always lent their albums an appealing eclecticism, and, though more of the songs on Pretty Together feel like collaborative efforts than before, each member still gets a chance to shine. Jay Ferguson (he's the one with the fragile, high voice) pops up with the gorgeous, spare ""Are You Giving Me Back My Love?,"" a quiet acoustic song that conveys the frustration of not knowing where a relationship is going, and has a loungy, almost Hawaiian feel that recalls the Pernice Brothers' ""Cronulla Breakdown."" Bassist Chris Murphy also takes a turn with quieter material on the excellent ""Life of a Working Girl,"" a reflective ballad about a woman taking a job like the ones most of us have: passable, but unfulfilling. Usually, Sloan's albums are packed with potential singles, but this latest effort really only offers one real standout: the marvelous ""The Other Man."" The song takes the side of the third corner of a love triangle-- the one who proceeds despite the fact that he knows he's destroying a pre-existing relationship. ""You know he's not the one for you/ But that's no fault of mine/ He knows I'm a friend of yours/ But he doesn't know I've crossed the line/ I know you've got a man in the picture/ But it hasn't stopped me yet/ We've all been in one situation or the other we regret,"" goes the opening verse, before one of the band's trademark harmonies carries the sterling minor-key hook deep into your head. Despite these and a handful of other moments, though, the overall feeling of the album is that it's, well, pretty together, but not as solid as it could be. Sloan simply seem to be trying too hard on some of these tracks, instead of allowing their natural melodic gifts to take hold. I still look forward to the band's future with high hopes, but for right now, the present isn't quite as bright as the past.","Sometimes writing music reviews sucks. No, really.

Total Pops Madness EP,Coquettish,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65dc0084474cd0c0946/1:1/w_160/238fbe44.gif,2001-11-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1601-total-pops-madness-ep/,Asian Man,"Punk. Bits of ska. Three chords. Sometimes melodic, sometimes not. That there is ten words, and they're almost all I have to say about Coquettish's seven-song, nine-minute Total Pops Madness EP. It's okay hardcore punk, nothing special. And yet, I must go on. So I'm just going to lay some random impressions on you. Forgive me if I jump around. To their credit, Coquettish do write relatively catchy songs, with upstroke guitar surges perfect for pogoing, and 80s-inspired chorus hooks chanted by the entire band. The energy is there and is somewhat infectious, and you can feel yourself rooting for the band as the guitars sometimes struggle to keep up with the drums and vice-versa. Still, I have to say that my favorite bits on Total Pops Madness are the brief introductions and interludes that are placed between the ""real"" songs. ""My Favorite Tune"" opens with a charming, melodic fuzzpop riff before the drummer decides he's had enough and kicks the tune into blistering hardcore mode. ""How Many Boys Do You See"" is 35-seconds long-- the first 26 of which are almost roots-style reggae. That's the part I like. The final nine seconds I could live without. It's funny: the first few times through Total Pops Madness, I'd resigned myself to not being able to understand a single word of the lyrics. ""Is this even English?"" I asked myself. I had kind of hoped I was listening to some overseas punk, but the lyrics sounded close to English somehow (if not quite there). Normally, I'm not overly concerned with lyrical content, but something about the intensity of the screaming made me think the words might be important. I listened closer but still couldn't make out nothing, so I just chalked it up to speed-fueled punk energy and left it at that. Later, I looked at the CD booklet and realized that Coquettish are a four-piece unit from Yokohama, Japan, who do indeed sing in English, but with poor diction. Mystery solved. Listening to Total Pops Madness, I understood why Punk Planet's reviews have been such a joke since Issue #1. Could it be that there's just not much to say about most of the punk records released? When you're dealing with music created according to such a rigid formula (how ironic that a punk might describe chart pop as ""formulaic!""), spending words describing the smallest details that separate one record from the next seems futile. Better to pour one's energy into a 15,000-word Marxist rant about why Wal-Mart is so evil, despite the fact that the proletariat from coast to coast wants nothing more than to drip sweat on her endless linoleum floors. Um, actually, I've started to leave Punk Planet on the rack. Next to the punk rock.","Punk. Bits of ska. Three chords. Sometimes melodic, sometimes not.

Tribute to Masayuki Takayanagi,Fred Lonberg-HolmJim O’RourkeWeasel Walter,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9cdc0084474cd0c10c7/1:1/w_160/5af298c1.gif,2001-11-28 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8578-tribute-to-masayuki-takayanagi/,Grob,"For the better part of the 50s and 60s, Masayuki ""Jojo"" Takayanagi was among Japan's best-respected jazz guitarists. But it wasn't until his experiments with tabletop guitar led him down the seductive path of sonic experimentation that he became the stuff of legend. By the 1980s, Takayanagi had changed his song entirely, abandoning the comfort of structure for the cathartic joy of noise, his work paving the way for the likes of future innovators like Merzbow, K.K. Null and Bill Horith. Given the nature of his most influential recordings, Takayanagi has never been high on the list for tribute album candidates. Then again, Weasel Walter, Fred Lonberg-Holm and Jim O'Rourke (who perform here under the names Necrodevourer, Sado-Immolator, and Lycanthrovampire, respectively) have never been the types to let trivialities like convention or reason stand in their way. Paying tribute to noise music poses a lot of the same difficulties as writing about it. With no set of rules by which to play, how does one know if something is right or wrong, good or bad? Rather than attempting to recreate actual performances of Takayanagi (a move whose blasphemy would be akin to attempting to cover John Coltrane, every last note of each and every improvisation intact), Walter & Co. use the tribute concept as a platform for original music, attempting to recreate the moods and feelings often catalyzed by Takayanagi's work. The goal here is not to emulate but to understand, and then to apply this understanding to the application of one's craft. So if writing about music really is like dancing about architecture, does that mean that writing about noise music is like dancing about smoldering piles of rubble? Tribute to Masayuki Takayanagi is the sound of music crumbling apart, crashing to the ground, tearing itself apart from the inside. The album opens with ""For Jojo/Freebasing Styrofoam,"" a 30+ minute-long improvisation recorded live at a small Chicago club in 1996. The first fifteen minutes are utterly relentless. O'Rourke borrows Kevin Drumm's tabletop guitar, using it to create layer upon layer of noise. Lonberg-Holm tears spastically at his cello like an epileptic at a Japanese cartoon convention. Walter wails on his drums the way you know he would on every Flying Luttenbachers record were he not held back by structure. The piece quiets down briefly around the 14-minute mark, as Lonberg-Holm presents a new theme for the group to tear to shreds. It slows down again two-thirds of the way through, allowing O'Rourke a solo, wherein he masterfully molds feedback in much the same way he might mold a melody on one of his more commercial albums. Walter and Longberg-Holm come back in slowly, adding to the noise, until the movement is back where it began. It's a stunning piece of music (provided you can look past the near-absence of musical qualities), but always the perfectionist, Walter was not pleased. ""If anything,"" reads his well-thought-out liner notes, ""the performance came out more conventionally 'musical' and less 'extreme' than I think I originally had in mind."" The tracks that follow were recorded four years later. The charmingly titled ""Endless Corridor of Roasted Babies"" and ""Give Me Head 'Til You're Dead"" serve as ""For Jojo: Take Two."" The guitars crackle and feed back, the drumming is spastic and angry, the cello is frenetic and high-pitched, the structure is minimal. To an ear other than Walter's, there isn't much-- aside from the crispness of a studio recording and a few switches in instrumentation-- to distinguish the new tracks from the old. But it's interesting to hear the group approach the same idea a few different times. It helps the listener to understand the music in much the same way that the recently unearthed reject tracks included on Blue Note's recent Van Gelder re-releases do. Twice, however, the trio takes a slightly different direction. ""Slitted Tit"" features Walter solo and sounds like a guitar self-destructing, while ""Triumph of Death,"" Tribute's closing number, presents a vastly different sonic landscape: a long drone built from heavily filtered feedback that washes in an out like the sea. It's calming; almost unbearably so, given the chaos it follows. As one is lulled by the piece, one half-expects the tide of static to be interrupted at any moment by a barrage of screeching sonic noise. But it never comes. The trio rides out the album on these calm waves, proving that noise needn't always call for earplugs and gritted teeth. So does Tribute to Masayuki Takayanagi live up to its name? That's debatable. The gruesome track titles and the over-the-top aliases suggest that these guys have taken their fair share of liberties with the work. And given Walter's tendency for Kaufman-esque trickery and the relative obscurity of the figure at hand (not to mention the next-to-nonexistant nature of his recordings), I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the whole thing is a hoax. But does it even matter? When it comes down to it, Walter and company have created an hour or so of exciting music (read: relentless noise). And prank or not, it's just the sort of thing Takayanagi would have whole-heartedly approved of.","For the better part of the 50s and 60s, Masayuki ""Jojo"" Takayanagi was among Japan's best-respected jazz guitarists.

A Story in White,Aereogramme,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01913d19756521382d3/1:1/w_160/5cd80778.jpg,2001-11-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/62-a-story-in-white/,Matador,"I've had this creeping suspicion lately that I can relate just about anything in my life to Noah Baumbach's film Kicking and Screaming. For those who've seen it, maybe you'll understand. For those who haven't, bear with me. It's a dialogue-driven piece of celluloid populated by a bunch of post-college-grads who spend their time quizzing each other about films in which monkeys have a starring role, calling themselves the Cougars (or is it the Hawks?) and obsessing over trivial things like crossword puzzles, phone messages and a ""cookie man."" Okay, so that's a bit of oversimplification. The basic gist is that these four guys are trying to figure out what the hell they're going to do with their lives, but for the most part, they're too afraid to actually do anything about it. Cliché, right? Probably. And what does this have to do with Aereogramme, anyway? Well, see, there's this morose bastard in the film named Max who fixates on the tiniest things, obsessing over them to the point of social paralysis. At one point, he admits to a feeling of nostalgia for just about everything, claiming that he's nostalgic for events that are happening at that moment, and often for events that haven't even occurred. And nostalgia is exactly the state of mind I find myself in right now listening to Aereogramme's A Story in White. I doubt it's the reaction the band was looking for when they recorded this album, but once I heard the disc and read they were from Scotland, it was too late. So where does this yearning for the past originate? Mid-90s Glasgow. First it was Mogwai. Or was it Belle and Sebastian? I can't remember. Seems to me it was all around the same time anyway. Those late winter days of 1996 and the early months of 1997. It all happened so fast. Two Glaswegian bands flip-flopped a little corner of the music world (or at least mine) and, within a few months, indie scenesters were dropping their names at every opportunity. There have been other bands coming out of that Scottish town since-- markedly Arab Strap and the little-heard Ganger-- but nowadays people hear ""Glasgow"" and some of the names jumping immediately to mind are Belle and Sebastian or Mogwai. I'm no exception. Though, if this disc in any indication, people might soon add Aereogramme to that list of Glaswegian notables. Rising from the ashes of Ganger (singer/guitarist Craig B's former band), Aereogramme has been around since '99. Releasing a couple of now out-of-print singles, the lads finally found a home on the Chemikal Underground label (also home to Mogwai) and set up camp in a studio for a few months. A couple of EPs later, plus A Story in White, and these guys are approaching full sonic bloom. Spanning 13 tracks, the Matador issue of this album contains the full UK version, plus the entire White Paw EP. Capable of constructing quiet, beautiful melodies one minute and transforming into snarling tension-filled guitar fury the next, Aereogramme is sure to draw comparisons to Mogwai-- inaccurate though they may be. A Story in White has Aereogramme trying its hand in a number of different arenas: angular math-rhythmic guitar on the opener ""The Question is Complete,"" the lo-fi muted beauty of ""Egypt,"" the driven catharsis of ""Zionist Timing"" or the beautiful, string-laden ""Sunday 3:52"" that places them squarely in the Rachel's territory. Their tendency to hurdle genre boundaries and bound headfirst into different spaces is alarming at times. For an example, witness the transition from the sweeping, lustrous beauty of ""Sunday 3:52"" into the primal scream therapy of ""Screaming for Joey."" Dividing the album in two halves, ""Screaming for Joey"" captures Aereogramme in full bombardment gear, pummeling their instruments with Craig B shredding vocal cords amid the blare. In contrast, though, the standout moments on A Story in White are reserved for quieter melodies. ""A Meaningful Existence"" might just be the finest thing these guys have committed to tape. Beginning with just Craig B crooning atop quiet piano and some gurgling electronics in the background, it soon shifts into full-on Dave-Fridmann-style percussion boom. Pushing forward with driving rhythm, and propelled by drum fills and a muscular guitar solo, it's bliss-inducing moments like this that make the album so delightful. Electronically treating the instruments on many of the tracks, the distant thuds on ""Post-Tour, Pre-Judgement"" echoes dub territory before the song blossoms into a wash of multi-textured wash of guitar, vocals and electronics. The lyrics on the album rarely seem to be a focal point, but Craig B's vocals are rarely obtrusive (unless he's in full screech mode). And while his ability to shift pitches from quiet whisper or gentle hum to abrasive yowls is nowhere near that of the uncanny Mike Patton, it's an often mesmerizing thing. The broken-hearted ""Will You Still Find Me?"" is a mournful, lonely dirge with B sorrowfully chanting, ""If I am alone will you still find me,"" before fading into an electronic murmur. The album closes with three bonus tracks (""Motion,"" ""Messenger"" and ""The Art of Belief"" from the White Paw EP), all of which blend undetectably into the unfolding spheres of A Story in White. So has Glasgow done it again? Is Aereogramme the next indie household name? I don't know, but listening to this album repeatedly for a couple of weeks, I'm envisioning myself just like Max: nostalgic for this moment before it's even passed, and positioning myself in the future so I can look back and think, ""Remember when that Aereogramme album came out? The leaves were falling. It was cold and the heaters wouldn't work...""","I've had this creeping suspicion lately that I can relate just about anything in\n\ my life to Noah ...

Fugu 1,Fugu,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be5b5e6ef95969323235/1:1/w_160/d169dd64.jpg,2001-11-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3244-fugu-1/,Minty Fresh,"Crying babies. They're everywhere. Malls, weddings, funerals, crowded train stations, amusement parks-- no matter where you are, some small child is throwing a fit for some reason you couldn't possibly fathom at your more advanced age. Babies tend to cry at or near the resonant frequency of our eardrums (440 hertz, give or take) so that they can be instantly heard over even the loudest din, and when that sound is isolated, it's one of the most grating noises you'll ever hear. It's designed by nature to be a horrible, piercing noise. Keeping this in mind, I'm trying to determine why in the world Fugu's Mehdi Zannad decided to include the sounds of several crying babies in the untitled interlude (hereafter referred to as ""Track 13"") of his debut album. Of all the sounds in the world, that one gets to me perhaps more than any other. Screeching feedback? Fine. Microtonal sine waves? Great, bring it on. Crashing, dissonant orchestral crescendos? A walk in the park. But wailing infants? No, that just won't do. And the real rub of it is that this one lame little instrumental disrupts the flow of what's otherwise a rather pleasant pop album. In fact, ignoring Track 13 by skipping it or simply programming it out of your player's sequence reveals an album of many delights-- some ornate, and some quite direct. After an inconsequential orchestral introduction (also untitled), we're treated to what may be the best song on the whole album. ""The Best of Us"" (Zannad is French, but writes mostly in English) is a catchy, classic pop song that you'd swear was sung by a woman if the credits didn't state otherwise. Zannad indeed has a rather feminine falsetto, but for the most part, you can tell he's a guy. This doesn't stop Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier from sounding more masculine than he does on ""Sol y Sombra,"" the album's only song sung in French. It's worth noting that Fugu have accompanied Stereolab on several tours and that they're one of Tim Gane's favorite bands. It's no surprise then that Fugu's own sound bears the marks of Stereolab even when Sadier isn't offering guest vocals. However, Fugu exhibit none of Gane & Co.'s tendency toward experimentalism, gravitating instead toward a purer pop approach. Zannad backs his tunes with gooey production that recalls the most polished efforts of the High Llamas or the Minders, and a huge arsenal of back-up players, including a ten-piece horn section, nine string players, two flautists and a clarinetist. The overall result is full and satisfying, if a bit monochromatic. ""Baragan"" makes the most of its extensive arrangement, surrounding the basic harpsichord rhythm with McCartney-ish bass fills and meaty, trombone-led horn charts. You could check all kinds of influences from the Left Banke and Moody Blues to Todd Rundgren, the Beatles, and even Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, and they'd pretty much all be right. But there's also a certain modern lounge chill to the record that's hard to come by outside of a certain core of artists. Zannad packs a lot of melodies and countermelodies into 18 tracks on this disc, but virtually none of them are delivered with any particular sense of urgency. Rather, the musicians involved seem quite content to invite you into a relaxed state. Several of the instrumental interludes on the album shine just as brightly as the proper songs. ""Angel Fair with Golden Hair"" recalls the instrumentals from Pet Sounds with syrupy orchestration and simple, clean guitar hooks. ""Tsimbalon"" is all Bacharach, with a mellow trombone melody and spare percussion. Of course, Track 13 soon destroys the calm ""Tsimbalon"" induces, and it's time for the skip button. All in all, Fugu 1 is a fairly nice little slab of French Anglo-pop, and pleasant reading accompaniment if you can reach the skip button from where you're sitting. Still, all the baroque orchestral flourishes in the world can't save it from ultimately feeling fairly flat and unidimensional when you listen hard enough. Only two or three songs really stand apart from the bunch well enough to grab your attention, and they're gone fairly quickly. If your collection is already loaded with a bit too much pop in debt to the three big B's of the 60s (Beatles, Beach Boys, Bacharach), you probably don't need to buy this album. But if you do happen to purchase it, chances are good that it won't have you crying.","Crying babies. They're everywhere.

Insignificance,Jim O’Rourke,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0313d197565213afb0/1:1/w_160/a8fa2530.jpg,2001-11-27 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6040-insignificance/,Drag City,"As a lifelong Midwesterner just back from my first trip to New York-- my mind all abuzz with comparisons, my heart torn between the city I know and love and the city I'd only just begun to discover-- the last thing I needed was to arrive back in Chicago to the news that Jim O'Rourke, one of the city's finest and most ubiquitous musicians was taking off for the Big Apple, leaving nothing but a string of bile-flavored words about the Windy City and its musicians in his wake. And then along came the new album. From the very start, Insignificance comes across as yet another spit in the face, as O'Rourke's ever-steady voice intones the following: ""Don't believe a word I say/ Never thought you would anyway/ I may be insincere/ But it's all downhill from here."" Upon hearing this, I was furious. His initial comments-- which essentially left the city's music scene for long-dead-- were bad enough, but now he seemed to be asking me to ignore them, to write them off as, well, insignificant. What gall. This was where I drew the line. Immediately I conjured an image of O'Rourke the Rock Star. It wasn't just the uncharacteristically loud electric guitar and wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am drums that burst from the speakers the moment I popped in Insignificance and pressed play. It was the lyrics. I've always had a tremendous amount of respect for O'Rourke the musician, no matter my feelings about O'Rourke the media figure, and I've always been thankful that the two have never crossed paths. But Insignificance crosses that line again and again. ""If I seem to you a bit remote/ You'll feel better if you call me a misanthrope/ Well, what ever floats your boat/ But as for me, I'd rather sink my own,"" he continues on the album opener, ""All Downhill From Here,"" just as the feedback gives way to calm vibes and piano. While O'Rourke's lyrics typically revel in playful ambiguity, these come across as a dreadfully obvious response to his own less-than-favorable image. Frankly, I hadn't the patience. While generally less envelope-pushing then his more difficult-to-find work, O'Rourke's string of Drag City releases have always served as an opportunity to try on an assortment of masks. Bad Timing was the John Fahey tribute; Eureka the ode to the lost days of grand Bacharachian orchestration; Halfway to a Threeway a short but pleasant acoustic interlude; and now-- judging from the opening moments of Insignificance-- we'd reached Jim O'Rourke's rock n' roll phase. The lyrics on Insignifigance initially seemed to be those of a man overestimating his own importance, even as the album title suggests otherwise. Pleas to the public to ""get off my case"" may work for Thom Yorke, but Jim O'Rourke, talented as he might be, hardly carries the kind of cache for distressed-woe-is-me-rockstar-anthems. Maybe labeling the package Insignificance is intended as a signifier that O'Rourke is in on this joke. Maybe the title is intended to suggest that we've been taking the music, the lyrics, and the bold statements a bit too seriously. But, self-aware or not, lyrics like these come across as more than a bit self-indulgent, which makes the music, at times, that much more difficult to embrace. Which is a shame, because Insignificance sounds good. Sure, the arrangements are simpler and more rock-based than any of his previous efforts, bearing a resemblance to his production work with Smog, but not to any of his own material. Yet, again, O'Rourke proves himself to be an apt musical chameleon, every bit as adept at Elvis Costello-style rock songs as he is at more left-field arrangements. These may be pop songs, but they're hardly missing the signature O'Rourke touch-- they may start with over-amplified guitars, but they all give way to something else, be it harrowing steel-pedal and harmonica, or a long blast of feedback. And of course, a back-up band that includes Wilco's Jeff Tweedy on guitar and harmonica, Chicago Underground's Rob Mazurek on cornet and Ken Vandermark on saxophone doesn't hurt O'Rourke's cause any. And so, the musical arrangements refusing to leave the confines of my brain, I got to thinking. Ever since the international shit hit the fan a few months back, I've been marching about telling all manner of people to try to understand your enemy's point of view before you label them as ""enemy."" So, rather than take the label ""hypocrite,"" I stepped back. I gave Insignificance another shot. And another. And after a while I realized that it isn't the smirking, well-calculated affront to me and my hometown that I'd originally thought it to be. Lurking behind these spiteful lyrics is an uncharacteristically human portrait of a man caught between his obligations to one city and the seemingly infinite possibilities offered by another. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could relate to Jim O'Rourke. In its second half, Insignificance mellows out, suggesting a return to the relaxed vibe of Halfway to a Threeway. On the slow, acoustic number ""Good Times,"" O'Rourke sings, ""I'd like to raise the Titanic here/ Take a walk/ Down its molded streets/ And feel right at home/ 'Cause the dead don't talk,"" and the listener is left completely in the dark as to whether ""home"" refers to New York or Chicago. On ""Therefore I Am,"" O'Rourke sings, ""Me, I've traveled 'round the world/ I've seen so many things/ Why'm I talking to you?"" His voice is as calm and collected as voices come, writing off the insult as a joke, but the music-- built around a simple but forceful repeated guitar riff-- betrays him, threatening to call him on his bluff at any moment. Jim O'Rourke may not always be likable, but Insignificance makes him real. And ultimately, this is far more important. I may still be irked at O'Rourke, and I still feel the sting when I hear lines like, ""It's quite a gamble to speak out of place/ Those things'll kill ya/ And so could your face/ These things I say might seem kinda cruel/ So here's something from my heart to you/ Looking at you/ Reminds me of looking at the sun/ And how the blind are so damned lucky."" But now that's all beyond the point. Jim and I don't agree on much, but Insignificance is catchy enough-- and real enough-- to make me look beyond all that. So maybe in the end, the title Insignificance doesn't refer to O'Rourke's lyrics or to his boasts and claims. Instead, maybe it refers to a fragile man trying to fool himself into believing that uprooting himself after decades in one place is just that: insignificant. The result is a shockingly insightful and resonant look at the workings of a musician generally more given to hiding behind absurdly twisted turns of musical phrase than letting us in on the inner-workings of his mind.","As a lifelong Midwesterner just back from my first trip to New York-- my mind all abuzz with comparisons, my ...

Learning About Your Scale,Half-Handed Cloud,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c044c0084474cd0c3178/1:1/w_160/33da21ba.gif,2001-11-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3715-learning-about-your-scale/,Asthmatic KittySounds FamilyreAsthmatic KittySounds Familyre,"Christian bands really suck. Most of you probably don't need this reminder, but I thought I'd start out with an indisputable, self-evident statement of truth and then try to slightly undermine it. As a believer, people sometimes assume I'm required by Biblical command to purchase, listen to, and enjoy the music made by Christian bands, but the truth is, I simply can't stand the vast majority of it. In fact, I'm offended by about half of it and embarrassed by most of the rest. It's usually oversimplified, condescending, full of pat answers and clichés, and just plain bad from an artistic standpoint (something that almost always happens when ""the message"" is isolated and raised above all other concerns). But I live for the rare exceptions. Music that just happens to be made by people who are Christians, their art just an honest extension and reflection of who they are and where they are in life, and backed up by real emotion. Of course, music of this sort made by people of any faith (or lack thereof) puts a smile on my face just the same. Simply put, I like it if it's good, no matter who made it or what category it happens to falls into. Up until a few years ago, I knew of few exceptions, and I had almost completely written off Christian music as phony, disingenuous crap. Then along came the Danielson Famile, a revelation. They were so far from the follow-the-latest-trend Christian band marketing scheme that I was used to that I was forced to create a distinction between ""Christian Music"" and good, artistic music made by Christian individuals. It seems like a no-brainer now, but at the time it was a big deal for me. Now, a few years down road, main Famile-man Dan Smith runs a label of his own and has co-released (along with Asthmatic Kitty, the label run by sometimes Danielson Famile member Sufjan Stevens, and possibly the worst label name ever) this debut from the like-minded Half-Handed Cloud, a Knoxville-based one-man orchestra by the name of John Ringhofer. To put it bluntly and a little crudely, Learning About Your Scale is some wack-ass shit. It's like an even more hyperactive Danielson, but with less reliance on metaphor and symbolism, (if Danielson is like Psalm 18, Half-Handed Cloud is closer to Psalm 117, if you get my meaning), less Beefheartian, more Elephant 6-ian. Scale also reminds me of the last couple of records by the Microphones, in the sense that, though anything could happen at any time, there's still a thread running through it all. Learning About Your Scale runs through 25 songs in just over 24 minutes and makes use of about as many instruments (courtesy of a few friends), so it comes off as a little fractured and disorienting. But at the same time, it almost sounds like one extended piece of music. It all begins with a wide-eyed number called ""Worlds in Speech, Now in Reach"" which would surely be a future Jesus Freak classic if it stuck around a little bit longer. But the song soon disappears into the four-song mini-epic ""Those People We made? We Love 'Em!"" which has got to be one of the strangest adaptations of the creation story ever. At this point, less than four minutes into the album, one of its main shortcomings becomes pretty evident: Ringhofer's virtually non-existent attention span. The only problem is that this is also one of the album's strengths. The arrangements are lush, even orchestral at times, so it's not that things aren't fleshed out. You just wish you could enjoy them longer, or that the transitions would be smoother; Ringhofer gets bored with things pretty quickly, and shifts gears on a whim. But on the other hand, the album's jarring, fragmented feel is one of its more endearing qualities. The remainder of the album runs similarly a-mile-a-minute. It's as if Ringhofer is going for a different kind of minimalism-- a baroque minimalism that compresses songs in time, but keeps them sonically vibrant and instrumentally busy. There are quite a few successful examples here-- songs like ""We Must Be Ploughed-Up"" and ""Baby Moon,"" which feature a wide array of instruments and a lyrical completeness. Elsewhere, songs just seem interrupted midstream by the next track, and it can be annoying unless you're really paying attention. But, again, this hurriedness has its own aesthetic value. It offers the album a playfulness that wouldn't exist otherwise, and it reveals a trust in the listener that most Christian bands entirely lack.","Christian bands really suck.

Amethyst Rock Star,Saul Williams,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa40b1335d7bf1699634/1:1/w_160/2991c765.gif,2001-11-26 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8691-amethyst-rock-star/,American,"Know what I can't stand? People afraid of a little pretentiousness. Now, I'm not talking about bands that attempt to compensate for their shittiness by intentionally ruining a perfectly mediocre song (I'm looking at you Old Time Relijun) and I'm not talking about the vain, intellectual masturbation of prog-rock, but some artists need to have enough faith in the essential decency of their talent and songwriting to take that one extra step towards creating something wholly unique and original. If not for this, we'd be a world without Sgt. Pepper, Ege Bamyasi, and, er, Tales from Topographic Oceans. Which brings up a good point. Thanks in no small part to certain overindulgent groups who opt for 20-minute synth solos and concept albums crammed with socio-political heresy over more original, unexampled experimentation, critics have been given a fairly good reason to generally slam music that has the slightest hint of pretense. Yet, there are times when even the most seasoned reviewer comes across an album without precedent, defying comparison. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Saul Williams: actor, poet, Old Soul, artist, screenwriter, and leader of the oncoming prog-hop revolution. Catchy? Fresh off his role as a mental patient in K-Pax, Williams has called in Rick Rubin (producer of such indie luminaries as Slayer and System of a Down) and a small collection of session musicians to help retain that enormous amount of indie-cred he wears on his henna-stained sleeve. The scariest part is that he pulls it off. Most of you compilation junkies know Saul from his excellent contributions to The Lyricist Lounge Soundtrack, Eargasms, and Black Whole Styles. Drum-n-bass fans might have caught his high-minded ranting on the title track of Krust's Coded Language album (which makes a very welcome appearance here). Each previous outing has found our hero donning new sounds in his quest to find the perfect musical compliment to his spoken word, and this collection is no different. The first third of the disc is easily some of Saul's most inspired work to date, as the lyrics examine love, life, and the sociological. ""La La La"" features creaking violin flourishes and a chorus of demonic schoolchildren. ""Penny for a Thought,"" the first single off the album, comes next, and stands as one of the best showcases for Saul's wry sense of wit: ""An MC tells a crowd of hundreds to put their hands in the air/ An armed robber steps into a bank and tells everyone to put their hands in the air/ A Christian minister gives his benediction while the congregation holds their hands in the air.../ Hands up if you're confused."" All this-- over a chugging, abstract jungle beat and hi-fi headphone trickery-- left me a little breathless. Afterwards, I wondered if I was holding a classic. Sadly, it wasn't meant to be. Saul has long expressed his dislike for drum machines, devoting whole songs to the subject (the phenomenal ""Twice the First Time""), and with this band of session musicians behind him, he's free to pursue whatever it is he thinks sounds better than his more hip-hop-inspired work. It's on the more band-centric tracks that the record's pretentiousness is unsheathed. It wouldn't hurt if the musicians were more diverse in their playing, but with Rubin at the controls they follow a strict formula. Ultimately, it comes off as an amalgamation of soul (""She's Out of My Life"") and Rage Against the Machine (whose song ""Broken Man"" is sampled on the overlong ""Om Nia Merican""). It's not that these tracks are particularly horrible, but they seem to distort the flow of the album and sometimes segue in an awkward fashion. The problem is, I don't know of a place for Amethyst Rock Star. Your level of enjoyment depends on how much you invest in the lyrics and metaphors-- Saul's observations come flying at breakneck speeds and require undivided attention, rendering the album unlistenable as background music. Of course, that's not much of a complaint. Regardless, the man has the confidence and originality that lasting careers are made of. And I can't wait for his masterpiece.","Know what I can't stand?

Colors of Home,Kill Creek,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb95abf31b7dc7155b0e/1:1/w_160/2199224f.gif,2001-11-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4423-colors-of-home/,Second Nature,"Kill Creek isn't a very noticeable landmark. Just a small stream flowing south toward the Wakarusa about halfway between Kansas City, Missouri and Lawrence, Kansas. My girlfriend and I drive that stretch of I-70 a lot when I visit her at her parents' house in Lawrence. There's something relaxing about the wide open spaces and gently rolling terrain of Northeastern Kansas after a long flight from the East Coast, and there's something to the lay of the land that makes winters there seem extra cold. The guys in Kill Creek must know the same stretch of highway pretty well-- it runs through the cornfields they used to get drunk in after their earliest shows back in the late 80s, when they were still attending high school in Lawrence. Their music has a certain chill of winter to it that most bands of a similar ilk don't possess. Otherwise, the band occupies territory somewhere between the Get Up Kids, the Promise Ring, Mineral, and something entirely less strained and more current that I can't quite put my finger on. Whereas their older records, like 1996's Proving Winter Cruel, fell closely in step with standard emo trends of the mid-90s, their latest effort, Colors of Home, shows that the long gap between the two albums has thrown their sound open considerably. For one thing, the tempos are all over the place, often staying slow for some surprisingly spacious, quiet material. The layered group vocals of the opener, ""Hardly Accounted For,"" offer a promising start to an album that, for all its admirable intents and considerable effort, simply doesn't deliver much. ""Hardly Accounted For"" segues smoothly into ""Gett Up,"" which rides in on echoing drums with more well-sung harmonies before devolving into aimless guitar crunching and overwrought drumming. There's no math in this Midwestern rock, just tempered bombast and a definitive lack of direction. Both ""Hardly Accounted For"" and ""Gett Up"" end abruptly, before they feel like they've run their full course. ""Gett Up"" sounds great, though, when compared to the song that follows. ""Without It"" is full of earnestly churning guitars, vocals stretched beyond their capabilities into tuneless, obnoxious yelling, and lyrics like, ""A wait/ A time/ Alone/ A doubt/ A thought/ A weight/ I wrote/ A vow/ A shred/ Of truth/ A lie/ Of sorts/ Without a word."" To be fair, these are the band's lyrics at their absolute worst, but the tired emo of the song's music has counterparts in several other songs, like ""Mousetrap,"" ""Serotonin,"" and ""Grandfather's Left Side."" The band are far better off when they venture away from blandness of the songs mentioned above for tracks like ""The Divorcee,"" a mostly acoustic, drumless tune aided immensely by atmospheric keyboards and a downplayed trumpet solo. The only problem is that the song has so little memorable melodic content that it plays more like a Rothko than a Caravaggio-- there's a lot of color, but little else. This isn't always a bad thing-- hell, I love Mark Rothko's paintings-- but on what's essentially a power-pop record, it feels rather incongruous. That said, it's a direction I hope the band continues in, because it holds a lot more promise than most of the other styles they work in. Another welcome addition to the band's sound is the slide guitar that crops up on ""Cops"" and ""Kathleen."" In the former, it serves as a distant response to the melodic vocals, creeping forth from the back of the mix. In the latter, it's a welcome contrast to the caterwauling vocals and frantically strummed guitars of the chorus. The album closes with ""Prying,"" a soft, percussion-free song colored by a hint of banjo that, though nice enough, really doesn't leave much of an impression. Kill Creek have certainly improved since their last outing, and it seems likely that they'll continue to do so in the future. But while they may have made their best album to date, they still seem a bit lost in the former West.","Kill Creek isn't a very noticeable landmark.

How I Long to Feel That Summer in My Heart,Gorky's Zygotic Mynci,by: Nathan Rooney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf79ea9e61561daa7a7b/1:1/w_160/8cf8d978.jpg,2001-11-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3528-how-i-long-to-feel-that-summer-in-my-heart/,MantraBeggars Banquet,"London, 1977. The images that first spring to mind aren't very pleasant: London's Burning, Anarchy in the UK, social upheaval and discontent, inflation, pollution... wide collars. Far from the seething boil of the city however was the Welsh countryside with its sea cliffs, Norman castles and gently rolling hills. Here, respectable gentlemen had respectable children who would learn about Pooh Corner before being hustled off to bed, the father settling down in his recliner with a pipe, a spot of fine brandy and a good book (preferably A Shropshire Lad). Excuse the hyperbole, but with each succeeding album Gorky's Zygotic Mynci release they retreat further from their skittish early style, and over the years, they've gradually settled into a well-crafted folk/pop whose tranquility must be the influence of an idyllic past. It's apparent that, as little Zygotes, the Gorky's didn't have Johnny Rotten or the Clash blaring into their cribs, and that punks with pink mohawks were as rare and fantastic as unicorns. How I Long to Feel That Summer in My Heart is a testament to the influences of their youth; echoes of Lennon and McCartney, Simon and Garfunkel, Nick Drake, and Fairport Convention glide through the album before tiptoeing into a corner and reappearing a few tracks later. Think of ""Long, Long, Long,"" ""Scarborough Fair,"" and ""Pink Moon."" You detect as much of a hint of angst in this music as a fart in the wind. While hints of this pure melodic sense were evident on their earlier albums, more often than not the emphasis was on the eccentric or even the bizarre. Gorky has always enjoyed surprising or puzzling the listener, creating albums as varied and unpredictable as a Hieronymous Bosch canvas; they often sing in Welsh, and shift tempo, volume and instruments unexpectedly. On this outing however, all of the tracks are sung in English at an even, gentle tempo, and you're only taken by surprise when you consider the beauty of the arrangements, all of which are understated, with Euros Child's voice rarely rising above a whisper. GZM still incorporate an array of instruments into their songs, but here they complement the mood of the album well and add a subtle shading which prevents the set from ever tiring the listener. Lennon and McCartney allusions are there from the start. The first track on the album, ""Where Does Yer Go Now,"" starts off with an intro reminiscent of Mind Games. Before the track ends, though, you feel like you've just rummaged through the local music store. And the number of instruments the band manages to mix into a four-minute single is even more impressive when you consider how effortless it all sounds. It's a testament to the amount of care that's been put into these tracks. I often found myself listening intently just trying to filter out and categorize all of the detail. Considering that the main band members are credited with playing no less than 25 different instruments (and that doesn't include the string section or brass band), it's easy to get an idea of the amount of organization required to pull it all together. The Fab Four-modulated harmonies and looped electronic effects on ""Where Does Yer Go Now"" display the group's fascination with psychedelia, and it all swells into a final string arrangement of Magical Mystery Tour majesty. There are few true lapses on the album, but the slight second track, ""Honeymoon With You,"" is one of them. Sounding like a lost item rescued from the trash bin of The Velvet Underground & Nico sessions, I admire the intentions, but after a couple listens through this disc, you realize that despite all of their strengths, GZM lacks a strong lyricist to match their compositions. The flimsy sentiments of, ""I wanna honeymoon with you/ Coz I'm feeling so blue/ And if I honeymoon with you/ I'll get rid of these blues/ Ooh, ooh, ooh/ Get rid of these blues,"" show that no matter how hard they may try, they'll never come up with anything with the edge and bite that Lou Reed gave the Velvets. The only intriguing sets of lyrics throughout are those to ""Hodgeston's Hallelujah"" and ""Christina,"" a ballad so achingly sweet you're shocked to discover that it's a chronicle of an obsessed fan's plan to murder a starlet. ""Where Does Yer Go Now"" and ""Christina"" aren't the only standouts, though. There are strong songs throughout. The first single from the album, the longing ""Stood on Gold"" sounds like it could have been stolen from an Elliott Smith record with its breathy vocals and plaintive reflections on age and a lost lover; the earnest ""Dead-Aid"" with its melancholy arrangement for violin and hushed horns; the slowly swinging groove and sweet duet voices of ""Can Megan""; the brooding Dirty Three strings of the sailor's dirge ""These Winds."" I could go on naming great songs off this record, but the strength of these tracks only brings me back to the wish that Gorky's Zygotic Mynci would put as much effort into their lyrical content as they do with their instruments. I think ""Christina"" is a good template, despite the apparent influence of the Beautiful South on their sound. I'd like to see the band acquire more of a morbid wit and irony, or stray further towards a psychedelic whimsy a la Neutral Milk Hotel. I do notice a lot of affinities between the Gorkys and the Elephant 6 collective, and I'd love to see the results of bringing Jeff Mangum into the mix. Gorky's Neutral Zygotic Mynci Milk Hotel... maybe it's not such a good idea after all.","London, 1977.

The Proud Graduates,Spokane,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a516b1335d7bf1698b01/1:1/w_160/69ad89a4.gif,2001-11-26 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7423-the-proud-graduates/,Jagjaguwar,"To steal a line from Jack Black in High Fidelity, Rick Alverson makes ""sad bastard"" music. Thankfully, by the same virtue, it's ""damn beautiful,"" too. As helmsman for Drunk, Alverson fronted a band equally capable of conjuring up moody alt-rock Westerns and folky East Coast Americana. Now, after years of playing with that band, Alverson is also recording music from his home in Richmond, Virginia as Spokane. Spokane released the debut Leisure and Other Songs in 2000, and within a year Alverson had finished a second album, The Proud Graduates, and visited Maine to record American poet Robert Creeley reading his works for the first issue in the Jagjaguwar Correspondent series. Alverson might not share Creeley's confessional style, but a listen to both shows the transformative power of their emphatic delivery. Alverson's voice, warm and rich, yet wavering delicately, is accompanied on most songs by the other main Spokanester, Courtney Bowles. Sometimes she coos in harmony with him, and other times she echoes just a measure later, adding a sweet tone to complement his lower pitch. Together, they're metamorphic: ""Your room just isn't the same"" might be a dull statement for most, but from their throats, the chorus of the album's title track becomes a lament so melancholy that your own room might seem like that of a stranger's. The fading fall season seems to be trapped perfectly in the soft acoustic strums and sparse drums on this opening song. ""The Absentee"" continues with a greater sense of urgency. Alverson draws out each syllable in the verse (""Row my body home/ And stow my heart below"") until his weary refrain seems like wind brushing across the pane. The drums and guitar patter repetitively, their circular motif soon reprised by violinist Karl Runge. They reach the chorus, and Bowles' sing-song tempo, thankfully just shy of twee, brings a perverse cheer to the lines, ""I stayed up late sitting by the TV/ The happy faces spoiled my evening."" As you listen, you get a sense of Spokane's poetics, a strange combination of domesticity and distance. ""American Television"" answers ""The Absentee"" with an intricate embroidery of glockenspiel, violin and electric guitar. As Alverson vaguely describes, ""My dear wife/ There in the kitchen/ I can almost hear her stir,"" the swooning instruments say all that he won't bring to words. We can forgive Spokane for ""Other Rooms."" Someone should have told them that sampling the sounds of children and playgrounds has been done and done again, from Floyd to Boards of Canada to Rosewater Elizabeth. A move like this can mean Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for an album, but the poignant, chiming guitars that rise at the conclusion of this instrumental make it too damn pleasant to deride. Much of The Proud Graduates passes this way, in a smooth, unsurprising succession, yet the emotion in Alverson's honeyed rasp and the detail in every heartfelt chord keeps you hanging on. The persistent violin of ""Disappointed Athlete,"" in particular, recalls the sublime slowcore of Low's The Curtain Hits the Cast. Spokane come closest to breaking out of the subdued melancholy on ""The Workweek,"" as Alverson's voice rises higher, singing, ""The workweek will end (They told me so)/ And there will be another comfortable chair.../ But the stairs will creak/ And the dead wait in the street."" Of course, considering the characters, from the proud graduates to the athlete, one might make accusations of a certain bourgeois, ivy-league sense of sorrow. But that seems to be the point: sadness illustrated in the dull patterns of life, both lyrically and in the cycle of verse to chorus and back to verse. The heart never quite breaks in the tales Spokane tell; it clenches and then lives on. And if these simple tragedies are repetitive and maudlin in any way, they're like an orgasm: you keep coming back for the little domestic deaths.","To steal a line from Jack Black in High Fidelity, Rick Alverson makes ""sad bastard"" music.

"Bootleg Series, Vol. 1: The Quine Tapes",The Velvet Underground,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a937c0084474cd0c0fc6/1:1/w_160/cb518568.jpg,2001-11-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8435-bootleg-series-vol-1-the-quine-tapes/,Interscope,"In the more than three decades since Lou Reed left the band, the Velvet Underground's secured place in rock's canon has become pretty much watertight. Their towering reputation as rock legends is now irrefutable. Not too shabby for a band who, in their day, only sold a handful of records, and whose live shows were meagerly attended. The Velvets' current status has stemmed primarily from their four studio albums and their wicked, junk-inspired depravity. But what tends to get lost in the praise is the band's reputed brilliance as a live act, a reputation that should only grow exponentially after people have a chance to hear Robert Quine's tapes. Prior to this release, only a few ""official"" live Velvets releases existed: the incredible double-disc set 1969 and the tour documents from their mid-90s reunion being the most readily available. And then there's the dreadful Live at Max's Kansas City, which, while allegedly Reed's documented last stand with the group, is of interest only to those with dire historical interest or those with a need to hear table conversation revolving around drug scores. So now, with The Quine Tapes, the innocent public can finally find out what those confounded bootleggers have been shouting out for nearly thirty years: the Velvet Underground live on stage were a staggering dynamic presence, unpredictable and explosive. While mentioning bootlegs, I guess I'd better say that what the title of this box set suggests is exactly what you get. Unlike Dylan's Live 1966 or the majority of officially released, artist-sanctioned ""bootlegs,"" this release is a murky, sometimes shitty-sounding audience recording by Robert Quine, a rabid VU fan who would later play guitar with both Richard Hell and Lou Reed. So, the caveat: if you're looking for a pristine audio document, this isn't it. But if you're keen on hearing a record that's crammed with beautiful group interchange and a series of magical moments, The Quine Tapes has it all in droves. Capturing the band on a jaunt through the West Coast, Quine and VU archivist Bill Levinson have hand-selected a three-disc set of songs that finds the Velvets setting up camp in San Francisco amongst the hippies and peaceniks at two different venues: the Matrix and Family Dog. It shatters the illusion of the Velvets as decadent East Coast degenerates; on the contrary, Reed sounds surprisingly at ease, peppering the performances with friendly between-song banter and issuing often-revealing song introductions. The easiness spills over into the actual performances as well, which find the band stretching out into relaxed improvisations, often transforming arrangements and adlibbing lines. Of course, there are still the blistering sonic assaults that you'd expect from the Velvet Underground, but ultimately, Reed, Morrison, Tucker and John Cale replacement Doug Yule sound right at home. What with Reed's seedy lyrics about blowjobs, sadomasochism and an NYC world of hookers and junkie cravings, a tranquil setting isn't exactly what you might expect from a Velvets concert. But the majority of tracks here move along at an easy, flowing pace-- rarely hurried and always allowing time for the band's meandering explorations. The two versions of ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" (both of which are universes apart from the anxious edginess evidenced on The Velvet Underground & Nico) are leisurely and laid-back, almost entirely abandoning the hard-edged grit of the original. In particular, the delightful version from the Matrix on the third disc is a gorgeous, loping stroll that finds Lou Reed in a remarkably jovial mood, whistling in between a set of improvised verses. Elsewhere, the Velvets slam their feet on the gas pedal and push everything furiously into overdrive. With Cale's atonal viola scrapings and dissonant experiments gone from the fray, what we've got here is Reed and Sterling Morrison urging the others on with full-throttled, bursting-at-the-seams guitar fuzz. ""I Can't Stand It"" moves at a fever pitch for over six minutes with Tucker and Yule thumping away on percussive duties while Reed unleashes a frantic guitar solo. ""Foggy Notion"" is out of the gates in a heady blaze with Morrison and Reed swapping riffs in a Chuck Berry-esque rock and roll boogie. The dim points on The Quine Tapes are few and far-flung. With the band stretching out into extended jams with re-arranged tempos and rhythms, the misses occur much less often than you might imagine. One of these few instances-- ""Follow the Leader,"" which opens disc two-- unfortunately drags on ad infinitum, the band drudging along in a clamorous din as if they never quite achieved liftoff. Some might consider Cale's absence a drawback to these recordings, especially on the renditions of earlier songs like ""Black Angel's Death Song,"" ""Heroin"" and ""Venus in Furs""; however, with Yule thudding away at the bass and organ, the rest of the Velvets crank up the intensity (and volume), substituting massive distortion and fuzz for Cale's screeching viola. The best tracks here are the ones in which the band allows space for everything to unfold in a lazy haze, playing with sheer exuberance and joy. On the third disc, they sound completely rapt with the still fresh ""New Age"" and drift in a hypnotic trance while Reed repeats the mantra: ""It's the beginning of the new age."" Still, what's most likely to delight fans on this set is the track Quine and Levinson have reserved for the final spot on each of the three discs, ""Sister Ray,"" which clocks in respectively at 24, 38 and 28 minutes. ""Sister Ray"" is pure rock enchantment, the band casting a spell on their audience and then freeing the rein on a guitar roller-coaster joyride. Like the Matrix version of ""I'm Waiting for the Man,"" each take of ""Sister Ray"" focuses more heavily on slipshod, careless joy than on the brilliantly concentrated intensity of the studio version. On the third disc's version (taken from Quine's tape of Washington University at St. Louis in May '69), Reed starts it with the warning, ""This is going to go on for awhile."" And it does, eventually climaxing into a churning maelstrom of distorted fuzz. ""Sister Ray"" was seemingly used to end each show, a cathartic spree into the outer limits of the band's sonic imagination. Beginning as a slow-burner each time, Reed spits out the debauched lyrics while the band jumpstarts the locomotive engine and lets the train begin its steady roll. Serving as a showcase for Reed's hyper-electric guitar-fuzz rave-ups, the band chugs along behind him, Yule both bashing and tickling notes out of the organ while Moe Tucker beats her kit in time with the engine. On two of the song's three takes, ""Sister Ray"" erupts into the twisted elation of ""Foggy Notion."" It's all such a magnificent, zigzagging mess that there's no wonder the Velvets seemed in such high spirits. By the time the locomotive draws to a stop over four hours after the box set's first track, you're left in a wake of blistering guitar solos and pure rock and roll energy. Robert Quine was one of the lucky few to have experienced the Velvets live and, from the evidence gathered here, it looks like he caught them at their musical zenith. If the name of this box is any hint at all (and let's hope that it is), what we have here is the first in a series of archival releases that will serve to finally shed light on the Velvet Underground's ludicrously mind-boggling live incarnation. With their legendary status already secured, The Quine Tapes serves to ensure that it's never questioned.","In the more than three decades since Lou Reed left the band, the Velvet Underground's secured place in rock ...

Hope That Lines Don't Cross,Mitchell Akiyama,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a034b1335d7bf1697f85/1:1/w_160/557bd24c.jpg,2001-11-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/89-hope-that-lines-dont-cross/,Alien8Substractif,"Remember Ghostbusters? Spengler, Stantz, Venkman and Zeddemore were unlikely heroes for the 1980s. In a period of cultural myopia for the USA, when stockbrokers and CEOs were shattering glass ceilings, these guys ran a pest control business. They were glorified plumbers, cleaning up the shit nobody else would touch. Plus, they broke the rules, crossing their ghost-catching beams when all along they'd been told not to. And their final enemy was a perfect symbol of materialistic excess: the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, a giant blob run amok in New York City. Now, in the wake of our prosperity, as we confront the skeletons in our closets, Americans seem to be remembering the blue collar once again. Of course, the title of Mitchell Akiyama's new album reminds me of the movie. Hope That Lines Don't Cross follows an earlier CDR that Akiyama self-released. His debut album for an honest-to-god record label is also the first for Substractif, a subsidiary of Alien8 Recordings. Akiyama began his musical career as a jazz musician, but it doesn't show much in his music. Instead, he's composed 10 tracks of minimalist electronica, heavy on the glitch-dub influence (think Mille Plateaux artist snd) and fused with drones and field recordings of half-heard conversations. Unfortunately, the worst songs here sound like Jan Jelinek's Loop-finding-jazz-records slowed to about half-speed, with the plips and pops brought to the foreground and none of the rich bass or dynamic transitions that made that album fascinating. Or, you can imagine a limp Pole. The title to ""Palindrone.1"" describes itself, and my annoyance with it, perfectly. Bristles of static and a brief voice can be heard in the background. Out of the void rises a drone, augmented by increasingly crisp cracks and echoes of dubwise momentum. But the rhythm never changes. Rather, it gets decorated with some watery sputtering sounds, and eventually fades out much the same as it began. ""Resists Chance Nicely"" might be having a go at itself, but I don't see the point. At least the immutable beats here are more complex. The choppy syncopation contrasts just passably enough with the keyboard whims that begin to manifest, adding a rumor of warmth. But ""Concentrate on One Leg"" returns to the land of the frigid. The constant 1-2-whump-whump anaesthetizes the entire track; played quietly, the subtle samples are hardly audible, and though it sounds great for a second when blasted, the dull thump of the beats will crush your brain in the grip of monotony. ""Error Than Trial"" marks the halfway point. Finally, excitement: we're treated to a funky boom-bip glitch beat as weird stabs of electro-plasm appear. A power drill drone that had been lurking in the background roars to life, louder and louder until the squabbly synth gossip is entirely overwhelmed. But even here, the structural frame is too simple and predictable, and the surprise only works because of the sterile ground surrounding. Fortunately, the last half of the album improves. ""Named After the Chorus"" actually introduces a melody through the lovely ring of the gamelan, cycling over and over in a short lullaby. ""Thepathofleastresistanceispaved"" finds the essence of dub minimalism in overlapping waves of seductive bass, cryogenic crackles and comfortably numbing drums. And ""The Height of the Matter"" concludes with amazing intensity, its rushing currents of noise probing the same dark abyss that Rapoon explores. Akiyama seems to have encountered none of the poltergeists captured by labelmates Set Fire to Flames on their recent Alien8 debut. The phantom voices hidden in the depths of this recording don't frighten because they can barely be heard. They're drowned out by the clinical tone of his basic rhythms, and they can't challenge the listener when they sound so brittle that they seem about to break. Even the Ghostbusters wouldn't want to investigate. Hopefully, in the future, Akiyama's jazz background will offer insight into the kind of interplay of elements necessary for this kind of animism. As it is, this is ambient for the waiting room of a doctor's office, for stainless steel halls artificially lit, a form of foundation makeup for silence. He may have got the wish in the album title, but obsessive compulsion has resulted in neutrality. Not good. Not bad. Just.","Remember Ghostbusters?

Mandala 2000/Live at Kichijoji Mandala II,Ruins,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2cf13d1975652138955/1:1/w_160/66d5fb5a.gif,2001-11-25 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11815-mandala-2000live-at-kichijoji-mandala-ii/,Tzadik,"Go ahead, turn it down. Like two tigers feasting on raw flesh with the white blades and inherent aggression nature selected for them, this is uncompromising stuff. The pounding of the skins and various shredded tissue may seem unnecessarily grotesque to the uninitiated, but it's no more disgusting than your average visionary art. This is a fierce, relentless exhibition, and something that most people aren't prepared for. Ruins are the brawny brainchild of Japanese drummer Tatsuya Yoshida. When he formed the band sometime in the summer of 1985, it was originally supposed to be a power trio, but after the guitarist didn't show for their first rehearsal, it was bumped down to a bass/drum-only duo. At the time, Yoshida was also performing with YBO2, which featured avant-alternative guitarist K.K. Null. The seeds of the present-day communal atmosphere of Japanese underground musicians began sprouting with this early moonlighting affair, as Null would go on to play with Zeni Geva (among others), and Yoshida would go on to play with just about everyone. From an early point, Ruins established their alliance to the avant-garde tradition. On their earliest recordings, they teamed up with American experimental icon John Zorn, and eventually put out albums on his Tzadik label. Their sound is dense mix of industrial noise, prog theatrics, and free-improvisation. Some critics have used the term ""jazzcore,"" but there really is no describing the duo's sound accurately. They play something of a fusion of punk and progressive rock, with an emphasis on everything at once. Almost all of their music features the kind of angular riffs and meter-changes made famous by maligned prog bands such as Gentle Giant and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but with precisely 0% of the pretension or general pomposity many people associate with that music. Ruins also sing, or something thereabouts, and anyone unaccustomed to total vocal freakishness will probably run for cover after a few seconds of this stuff. After 12 studio albums, 10 recorded collaborations, and several EPs (not to mention seven-inches and compilation appearances), I'm still taken a little aback by Yoshida's jittery caterwauling and current bassist Hisashi Sasaki's warbling falsetto. This kind of approach to vocals probably grew from Yoshida's obsession with French bizarro-proggers Magma, who specialized in music that was a little like Carl Orff's Carmina Burana crossed with early-70s Miles Davis. In a phrase: the Opera of the Apocalypse, and I think that would apply to Ruins as appropriately. Mandala 2000/Live at Kichijoji Mandala II captures the duo in concert, performing tunes mostly from their last couple of albums, and a fair amount of improv. It's actually their first decently recorded live album, and is definitely the next best thing to witnessing their brand of carnage in person. Songs like ""Gharaviss Perrdoh"" and ""Hyderomastgroningem"" get by on sheer super rock. That is, there's still a discernible link to toe-tapping and fist-pumping anthem-and-roll here, though you may have to wade through a few layers of distortion to find it. The former tune veers off the path with some fairly harsh-- even by Ruins standards-- group improvisation, but quickly rediscovers the groove as Sasaki's monster bass drives all its edges into the ground, while never betraying the studied dexterity it takes to pull this music off. ""Vrresto,"" ""Bupphairodazz"" and ""Pallaschtom"" are more convoluted samples of Ruins phenomena, as riffs and beats fly by so fast that it's often difficult to really tell what's going on. Adding to the confusion is the omnipresent punk ethos of always playing with as much intensity and reckless abandon as possible, so you'd be forgiven for thinking sizable chunks of the music were mere walls of noise. Listen closer (though I suggest adjusting the volume beforehand), and you'll begin to see that it isn't just noise, and that these guys must have spent hours rehearsing just to get through a whole tune. Either that, or they're simply not human. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, too. ""Classical Music Medley"" and ""Hardrock Medley"" are fairly self-explanatory: 20 or so famous classical and classic rock themes, respectively, get thrown in the blender and spit out in two minutes or so. They're novelty tunes, to be sure, but I mean, really, by this point in the album you'll be grateful for anything recognizable. Additionally, there are several tunes featuring violinist Katsui Yuji (Rovo, Bondage Fruit); the basic aesthetic remains essentially the same, albeit slightly more colorful. I should also mention that you only get about a second of silence in between each of the 23 songs, so mathematically speaking, you should be prepared for less than a half-minute, cumulatively, to catch your breath. And so we have yet another relentless Ruins album. I shouldn't have to tell you that these guys are an acquired taste for most people. Personally, I think it's the best possible thing that could ever have come out of progressive rock, but others might not even consider this music at all. For newcomers, I would advise starting out with one of the studio albums, such as Burning Stone or Hyderomastgroningem, before diving in here. After that, check out Symphonica, which tones down the chaos but drastically increases the prog factor by adding keyboards and extra singers. And then, when you're ready to settle down to a night of thrills and spills, pop this one in. It's a beast, and I put it to you: go ahead, turn it down, if you must. This is hardcore. This is Ruins.","Go ahead, turn it down. Like two tigers feasting on raw flesh with the white blades and inherent aggression nature ...

Transform,Alva Noto,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06b5e6ef9596931ff46/1:1/w_160/7fd17bea.gif,2001-11-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/143-transform/,Mille Plateaux,"Headphones. You must have headphones. Berlin-based producer Carsten Nicolai, who releases music as Alva.Noto, has assembled an album of tones so pure it would be a shame to sully them with the reflective surfaces of your listening area. There should be as little space as possible between your eardrums and the pulsing diaphragm of the speaker trying (possibly in vain) to translate Transform's pristine sound waves into vibrating pockets of air. If the technology were available, one might consider wiring the bitstream of a CD player directly into the auditory cortex, thereby eliminating the inevitable distortions introduced by irregular vibrations of the eardrum. Alas, such a brilliant invention is unlikely in my lifetime, so let's stick with the headphones. Like Ryoji Ikeda, whose +/- album is a major influence here, Carsten Nicolai is concerned with the fundamentals of electronic sound production. Sine waves, white noise, clicks, pops and beeps-- that's about all there is to the ten untitled tracks of Transform. Synthesizers could make all these sounds when Brian Eno was a wee lad eyeing the acoustic guitar hanging in the shop window. Music this minimal is like good cooking in that the ingredients are simple and the genius is in the arrangement. Transform is like a hot cup of delicious miso soup. Nicolai's keen sense of rhythm is the first thing you'll notice about Transform. Track 4 has a particularly propulsive drive, with a thrust of bass static, stop/start buzzing in the upper register, and something approaching a beat coming from the glitches in the midrange. The bass hook that leads into track 6 has something of a pop quality, with a classic ascending/descending motif (just don't hold your breath for a chorus). Nicolai sticks to clear rhythm structures and arranges his glitches in riffs, and memorable patterns abound. When he's not forcing his battery of microtones to dance the mashed potato, Nicolai delves into icy atmosphere. The tones here are as dry and cold as a drafty apartment with baseboard heat, and not even a hint of reverb colors the individual sounds. The studied aridity of the recording reinforces the need for headphones; hearing even the slightest echo from the back wall would negate what Transform seems to be going for. Track 2 is nothing more than a sine wave in the 400 Hz range that wavers slowly from ear to ear, topped with a cricket-like chorus of static that cuts out occasionally, leaving behind a single lonely beep. Track 9 is one of the few tracks to leave the grid behind, as hesitant, irregular crackles mimic the sound of a frightened animal, and another crystalline drone adds an ominous cast. While Transform is a solid success on its own terms, the record lacks a certain spark that might push it into greatness. There are no moments of wonder, where you pause and listen closer, straining to understand how something so little could affect you so much. It is possible to achieve the sublime with these limited ingredients (see Ikeda, for one), but Transform is merely good.","Headphones. You must have headphones.

Col. Summers Park,Jeff London,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd42eb335119a49ece3a/1:1/w_160/beb6ed34.jpg,2001-11-19 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4836-col-summers-park/,Hush,"Jeff London is a wuss and his voice makes me want to hit him in the face with a wiffle-ball bat. Just something unpleasant enough to communicate my dislike, without the risk of causing serious injury. Come to think of it, maybe that's just the problem with London's album. Col. Summers Park does just enough to make a point, to communicate an emotion, but it never goes far enough in any one direction to make a serious impact. London swings a peacock feather, instead of the Louisville Slugger that any musician should wield if he expects you to give a damn. Maybe it's the whole notion of anti-rock. If you weren't aware, Hush Records prides itself as the world's foremost producer of ""anti-rock."" And just what, you're dying to know, is anti-rock? Damned if I know, but Hush describes it as music ""bereft of power chords and bombast, lacking bravado and hot licks,"" proudly admitting that it is, ""well, weak,"" and promising that, ""Yes, sirree, as long as there is rock, we will celebrate our weakness."" Well, fine. Personally, I don't think the more moronic strains of rock need an antidote, being self-incriminating enough not to require outside assistance. And, well, the rest of rock either works or it doesn't. This whole anti-rock thing, though, just seems like a cheap trick to avoid being tagged as the more pedestrian ""folk,"" or the more direct ""sucks shit."" But, hey, that's neither fair nor accurate. Hush has put out a fair amount of really beautiful, really well put together, um, ""quiet music."" Some of that can even be found on this Jeff London disc. This album's title song is, melodically speaking, anti-original, but still a very pretty track. The doubled vocals on the second verse and the introduction of drums shortly thereafter are a few of the details that London uses to good effect, in order to build the song up from the soft, insistent guitar strumming at the track's outset. Rachel Blumberg, London's vocal adornment and partner on several of these songs, offers fragile harmonies that keep things anti-redundant. ""Strong Winters Cease"" reminds me of the coda to a dinner party I attended two or three summers ago. After being pummeled by an endless supply of red wine, the party-goers retired to the living room furniture for a sit-down session of ""pass around the acoustic guitar and let anybody emboldened enough by the alcohol make a fucking ass of himself."" Like I said, the wine was plentiful. As one poor bastard took the guitar, people shot knowing, nervous glances at each other. And then it began. Tone-deafness and self-assurance make formidable partners, and before you know it, everybody was making the same ""struggling to look normal even though I have a turd in my mouth"" facial expression. ""Strong Winters Cease,"" and particularly London's quavering, meandering lines, remind me very much of that performance. Granted, the melody is decent and the song resolves nicely at the end, but London's voice sounds best (or rather, anti-worst) when he sticks within a tightly circumscribed range. Things dart from insipid to barely-less-so for the next six tracks, with few quality stops. ""Routine Abandonment"" is one of the respites. The distorted bass and piano flourishes are executed well enough to keep things interesting, and to divert attention from London's whiny pipes. Certain aspects of other tracks work beautifully. ""Grenada"" flexes beautiful guitar lines and harmonies between London and Hailey London, while ""Long Island"" has interesting, if overwrought, interplay between a pedal steel guitar, sleighbells, and a Rhodes keyboard. The withering, depressed buzzsaw guitar solo that punctures the quietude of ""Cat on a String"" is also noteworthy. The album's real stand-out track, however, is the charming ""How Love Is."" It's pop magic, sounding something like a Beatles/Motown hybrid, with an amazing boy/girl chorus featuring handclaps, an Elvis Costello-esque melody, and the line, ""That's how love is/ You can't catch in it a net/ And make it your pet for just one day."" I think somewhere along the way, sad-music musicians forgot that the relationship between ""quiet,"" ""pretty"" and ""arresting"" is, at most, correlative-- and not causal. Jeff London can write a tune, or at least, he has the occasional lucky fluke. In any case, there's ample evidence he's got a good feel for pop melody. If he'd pawn his acoustic, stop trying to be so damned coffee-shop, and write some more bouncy sing-alongers, I'd feel better about urging you to check him out.","Jeff London is a wuss and his voice makes me want to hit him in the face with a wiffle-ball ...

Faux Mouvement,Autour de Lucie,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15813d19756521385e1/1:1/w_160/8526b91e.jpg,2001-11-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/376-faux-mouvement/,Nettwerk,"This band once played the Lilith Fair. That probably scared away a lot of you. For those of you remaining, let me just say that Autour de Lucie doesn't really fit the whole Lilith stereotype. That's to say this is not singer/songwriter vitriol spewed at the male-dominated world by some waif with armpit hair, though the band is from France, so you never know about the shaving thing. In fact, everyone involved in Autour de Lucie is male except for Valerie Leulliot, the band's primary writer and breathy singer/guitarist. This is Autour de Lucie's third album and they immediately deserve props for not caving to the pressures of the international record industry and singing in English. These lyrics are all en Francais, and for an English-speaking listener, it shrouds the band in an alluring mystique. For all I know, Leulliot could be singing about sniffing glue and snarfing Cheetos, but that's the luxury of listening to something that's not in your language-- there's one less thing to analyze. Faux Mouvement finds the band moving more fully in un direction electronique, terrain they explored ever so briefly on their last outing, 1999's dark, lush Immobile. Skittering drum machines and synth textures blend nicely with live drumming and string arrangements for a sound that often feels icy, despite enveloping you like a well-made afghan. The richly textured opener ""Je Reviens"" demonstrates this paradox nicely, as a cold string section swells behind Leulliot's sultry voice, which is pushed all the way forward in the mix. ""Je Suis un Balancier"" follows with creeping, filtered beats and organ chords under a partly spoken vocal. It's a bit too long at almost seven minutes, but satisfying for at least half its duration, if not all, depending on your mood. Of course, the band's decision to sequence the two longest songs on the album at the front gives Faux Mouvement an unbalanced feel, and some fine shorter songs drift past unnoticed later in the album as a result. This is compounded by the fact that these songs are all composed of roughly the same elements, and thus, tend to bleed together. Still, moments such as the abstract beats, close-mic'd hi-hats, and rubbery bass groove of ""Sans Commentaire"" show Autour de Lucie as a band very willing to be openly experimental. The main problem with their new will to throw caution to the wind and simply play with sound is that when they do so, they forsake the catchy melodies and simple structures that made their first two records so appealing. Resultantly, ""Vide"" is interesting if you pay close attention, but it's hard to take with you anywhere. Likewise, the flowing orchestrations on ""Chanson de L'Arbre"" are initially compelling, but ultimately remain in the mind like a movie score: full of mood, but no grabbing substance. Overall, a general feeling of ennui sets in as you listen to Faux Mouvement for the second or third time. This is a great album to throw on when you need something to enhance the mood or otherwise fill the air when working on something else (like writing this review). Unfortunately, if you really want to get to know all of these songs, you have to remember which is which by signifiers. For example, ""Lent"" is the song with the muted trumpet in the verse, some kickass beats and some freaky guitar work. God help you if you want to try to remember the melody, though, because it hardly exists. It almost appears as if Autour de Lucie are trying to slowly break with their pop past in favor of the Brian Eno ambient technique of making music that you listen to closely, or walk away from and return to 12 minutes later without having missed much. ""Le Salon"" is the only thing here that really visits the familiar pop territory that they used to reside in, replete with a fuzzy bassline and Farfisa organ amid the little spacy squiggles floating through the verses. But even as the most straightforward track here, it sticks about as well as Teflon. As a mood piece, Faux Mouvement plays very well, and as the band's first developed foray into the electronic world, it stands as a promising piece. With some work on incorporating the fantastic melodies and songs of old into the experimental, moody setting found here, they could really be onto something. For now, though, it's best to stick with their first two and wait for album quatre.","This band once played the Lilith Fair. That probably scared away a lot of you. For those of you remaining ...

He was the first of any of them to talk to me. I fingered the cheap plastic band that circled my wrist, and then wriggled my toes, which were kept warm in hospital-issue socks with gripped undersides. I eyed an overweight woman in her mid-30s. She'd watched me as I slept, and now she was following me around, refusing to let me out of her sight. I know how I got there, for the most part, but patient reader (no pun intended), your imagination will serve you fine. Just know that I woke up with the sad zombies-- these shell-shocked men and women, most of them middle-aged, who drifted through the ward like ghosts, their minds lost in the past, or perhaps an alternate present. All I know is, they were neither here nor there. But George, the muscular black guy with the afro and dated flannel shirt, was closer to here than there. And he wanted to know if I was okay. It took the strength of a scream just to whisper, ""Yes."" Of course, I wasn't, but I was pretty sure I was better off than anyone else there. Not better, mind you, but better off. That is, my muscles weren't made rigid by anti-schizophrenic drugs. I wasn't drooling. And whenever I spoke, I did so with another person. It might seem like a depressing time. Instead, it was revelatory, even uplifting. The same could be said for listening to Spiritualized's latest, Let It Come Down. With all of Jason Pierce's tormented vocals, with his talk of addiction and recovery, of fractured love, of the burden of religion on the soul; with all this, you'd expect him to be confined to a straitjacket. But rather, he manages to make it all sound glorious, as if these rock-bottom moments are equally responsible for the beauty of living-- or of not dying. Admittedly, some of that glorious feeling comes from the choir, or the brass band, or the orchestra-- which, all told, amounts to about 100 contributors to Pierce's vision. Meanwhile, Pierce has ditched nearly the entire lineup from 1997's ambitious Ladies and Gentleman, We are Floating in Space, but surprisingly enough, the sound here isn't drastically different, just slightly more lush and refined. The caterwauling opener, ""On Fire,"" exhibits this point well enough. A rapid, twinkling piano starts the track off, followed by buzzing guitars and then Pierce's voice, which tears through the carpe diem lyrics with ample bile: ""Let's see how high we can fly before the sun melts the wax on our wings/ Let's see how fast we can go before our eyes can't follow the road."" But he's soon accompanied by a choir and blasting horns, which propel the sound to almost overwhelming heights. The following number, ""Do It All Over Again,"" is the opposite-- a simple, uncluttered song. Horns are again used here, as are faint background voices, but sparingly; the song is mostly comprised of a crisp acoustic guitar, rumbling drums, and Pierce's more relaxed vocals. ""I love you like I love the sun in the morning,"" he sings. ""But I don't think a few words of mine are going to make you change your mind/ And I'm going to spend the day in bed and I'm planning on sleeping my life away."" Somehow, these modest elements combine for one of his finest moments yet. The rest of the album lands somewhere between these two tracks. ""Don't Just Do Something"" takes the slow-building gospel route, while ""The Twelve Steps"" starts with heavy riffs and raucous horns before halting to a bluesy, siren-laden interlude reminiscent of Ladies and Gentleman's 17-minute closer ""Cop Shoot Cop"" (which, sadly, doesn't have a counterpart here). ""The Straight and the Narrow,"" a slow, simple ballad about a failure to beat addiction-- ""I don't fall off the wagon, you know/ I take a dive and go as deep as I can go/ Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time""-- is yet another epiphany. But so, too, is the 10-minute epic, ""Won't Get to Heaven (The State I'm In),"" which overflows with strings and choir voices, then shifts at the halfway mark into a funk groove-- all without losing a step. Granted, a few tracks here require perhaps too much patience, or never peak as one might expect, or are overburdened with sound. But even these lesser tracks contain the simple, yet stunning affirmations that make Pierce so engaging. And these moments are revelatory not because of what they say about him, but because they have the power to trigger similar affirmations of our own: yes, they rolled me into the ward in a wheelchair, even though my legs weren't the problem. But I walked out the next day.","George wanted to know if I was okay. He was the first of any of them to talk to me ...

Seasonally Affective: 1996-2000,Piano Magic,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0689d034d5c69bf26ea/1:1/w_160/a67ce4e2.gif,2001-11-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6282-seasonally-affective-1996-2000/,Rocket Girl,"Even if we weren't around when they were made, certain cinematic images-- maybe even just fragments or reflections of the original-- are ingrained into our collective mind. They're all parts of this romantic obsession with cinema: flickering black and white projections, dark afternoon theaters, and that instant before a film ends where the camera captures someone's face and then irises in before the credits roll. Piano Magic has inadvertently been making soundtracks for these reflected fragments since the mid-90s. Then again, it's too easy a mistake to just stop with that evocative, imagined feel of Saturday matinee nostalgia. Because there's also a definite chill to their works, created by a lyrical and musical backdrop often filled with ghoulish living-doll voices and a David Lynch-goes-Through the Looking Glass sonic surrealism. Still, that's missing the band's often Kraut-inspired, layered electronic fuzz, the Baroque-type elegies of WWI, and their recent instrumental work that falls somewhere into GYBE! terrain. Piano Magic tend to exist in this state of fluctuation. And it's not just the music. Since the very beginning, Glen Johnson (the only member of the band with any real sense of stasis) has had a revolving-door policy concerning band members. The result is a band that's cycled through well over 30 members in just over five years' time. And they've recorded one-offs, singles, EPs and albums for almost as many labels as they've had members, which makes this compilation a welcome entry into the band's catalog (unless you're one of those fetishists who plopped down the cash for the original super-limited singles). Because not only is a full list of band members included on the inside tray, but this compilation collects every a-side, b-side and compilation appearance between 1996 and 2000. If it wasn't obvious before now, Seasonally Affective makes it painfully so: Piano Magic and Glen Johnson are at their best when laying down tracks for those little slabs of wax we call singles. While much of their full-lengths have been spotty with moments of beautiful clarity, the chronologically collected works here are brief, sequenced snapshots of the band in shifting phases. The result is an often jarring-- the sound may change drastically from one single to the next-- amassment of repeatedly beautiful material. Since there's so much material collected herein, it would be too daunting to cover everything, so I'll just hit some of the high and low points. The first track on the compilation, ""Wrong French,"" is the essence of what can make Piano Magic so great. Beginning with drizzled rain atop the creeping hum of organ in the distance, it suddenly erupts with crashing thunder before an eerie girl's voice begins speaking: ""And there were those films made in the 70s where dolls ran through fields, late at night, after men."" Raechel Leigh's voice and the purring organ build a haunting frame for the song. The voice, in particular, is, although not sinister, very creepy-- the nightmare voice of a doll brought to life. Speaking in terse, broken phrases like the string has just been pulled on its back: ""His shirt is my dress,"" or, ""It's breaking the jail of ribs,"" or the repeated anguish of, ""And he said it won't hurt."" Elsewhere, there's ""Wintersport/Cross Country,"" a melancholy-tinged track filled with electronic gurgles and shimmering keys while Hazel Burfitt's buoyant vocals name-check Charlie Brown, Snoopy (""falls dead in the snow"") and Lucille Ball. After the vocals end, we find Johnson and crew really feeling their way in the studio, layering clocks tick-tocking away over atmospheric synth, chirping birds, and a keyboard click-clacking into gallop mode for a hallucinatory four-minute stretch. Two tracks from the seven-inch ""For Engineers"" find Piano Magic in the studio trenches yet again, piecing together intricate layers of lo-fi noise and blending the sounds of static percussion, the droned murmurs of synthesizer and the banging of cans into a continually looping mix. ""The Fun of the Century"" is a beautiful acoustic dirge, with Jen Adam taking over vocal duties and crooning out precious lines like, ""Could it be that you broke me into a sheet of rain swept sideways?"" Conversely, the disc ends with ""Music for Rolex"" which finds Johnson playing it solo and delving into the minutiae of studio sound worlds. The result is at odds with much of Piano Magic's downcast output, a bubbly keyboard-laden adventure with intermittent bursts of static hiss and percussion that bounces along in measured, marching time. Appearing on the second disc, the rare ""Music for Annahbird"" single is presented in its entirety, three gorgeous instrumental tracks that are perfect representations of what make Johnson a studio whiz kid. The title track is loaded with synth-strings over burbling electro-loops, while ""Music for Wasps"" is all ambience filled with cricket-buzz, swamped-down murky electronics, and a distant scraping fuzz. The up-until-now impossibly rare ""Amongst the Books, An Angel"" is a glorious gentle track that lurches into a full-steam rocker, finding Johnson and Leigh swapping vocals. Beginning very calmly with just Johnson singing, the song soon swirls into driving guitar and 4AD-ish howling vocals. Of the two discs here, the second is the weaker, containing some subpar material amongst an overall great collection. Many of the complaints about Piano Magic in recent memory have been attributed to Johnson's too precious and somber lyric and vocal style. And although I don't find his voice difficult to endure, some of his lyrics are either horribly missed attempts at serious poetry or hilarious stabs at surrealism (""The Canadian Brought Us Snow""): ""Sleeping beside/ Treat us like eggs/ Box-jellyfish light/ Tinsel Legs."" A couple of things become apparent after listening to the collection several times. Primarily, the lyrics that Johnson pens are best interpreted by other singers. Secondly, and somewhat related to Johnson's taking over primary vocal duties, there's a distinct difference between the weightiness of early Piano Magic and the material rounding out the second disc. While an air of sadness has always been present in almost everything issued under the Piano Magic name, the earlier work was also saturated with a feel of playful energy and revitalization-- something that seems to be entirely absent from much of the slit-your-wrists depression of later tracks like ""Sketch for Joanne"" and ""The Biggest Lie."" Although that's not to say Seasonally Affective isn't worth your time. For anyone at all interested in the band, this compilation successfully paints Piano Magic as one of the better singles bands of the last few years, a group that's consistently rotating members and constantly on the path to reinvention.","Even if we weren't around when they were made, certain cinematic images-- maybe even just fragments or reflections of ...

Get Ready,New Order,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3df13d197565213be19/1:1/w_160/d362d82e.jpg,2001-11-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5767-get-ready/,Reprise,"It's been a long time since we've heard from New Order, hasn't it? A full eight years have elapsed since Republic dropped in 1993, and, listening back, the band's six albums hold up pretty well to modern ears. The band's members haven't exactly been slacking off, either, all remaining visible in the interim with various projects, including Electronic, the Other Two, and Monaco. Get Ready, the band's seventh album, finds them as able as ever, playing as though they'd never been gone, and offering their most organic album in ages. More so than on Republic, Get Ready's ten songs emphasize the songwriterly aspects of the band's sound-- the ones that made theirs some of the most transcendent dance music of the last two decades. The surprising thing about much of this album, though, is how much it rocks. Bernard Sumner's guitar is prominent and gritty, thrashing through songs like ""Crystal"" (the opening track and first single) with a driving, almost garage-y tone. Drummer/programmer Stephen Morris sticks to the traps more often than usual, always complementing his programmed beats with live playing. ""Crystal"" is a fantastic song, possibly one of New Order's best singles. Unfortunately, between an extended intro and repetitive, over-long outro, the album version loses some of the punch that the single edit offers. Nonetheless, it's hard to deny Peter Hook's amazing bass leads and the song's hook-laden chorus. New Order keep the tempo high for most of the album, and strike gold more often than not, especially on the excellent ""Primitive Notion."" Gillian Gilbert's textured synth patches wash over the song in waves, while Morris' drumming and programming propel it with busy, frantic rhythms. Sumner's voice, which is sounding decidedly less strained these days, ably carries a deft melody, while his guitar playing subtly fills in the rhythmic gaps left by Hook's melodic basslines. The aptly titled ""Slow Jam"" follows, pulling back the reigns a little and leaving the programmed beats at home for a full-on anthem, replete with multi-tracked vocals and a slow, soaring melody. The band's new focus on songwriting occasionally reveals their limitations in unflattering ways, though, such as the cringe-worthy opening lyrics of ""Rock the Shack,"" which features backing vocals from Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie and Andrew Innes. ""I've been accused of everything/ From Timbuktu to old Berlin/ I need some armor for my flesh/ I need to stop and take a rest,"" sings Sumner over a torrent of dirty guitar reminiscent of the most straight-forward moments on Primal Scream's Exterminator. Gillespie's backing vocals actually detract somewhat from the song, which is otherwise an energizing rave-up. Surprisingly better is the cameo from ex-Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan on ""Turn My Way."" He turns in backing vocals near the end of the song, though it's easy to miss unless you're really paying attention. Shockingly, Corgan restrains his nasal delivery to the point where he almost sounds like Sumner. With the possible exception of Innes, though, the most well-utilized guest is vocalist Dawn Zee, whose backing parts on ""Crystal"" and the ultra-danceable ""Someone Like You"" offer needed color to the sound. ""Someone Like You,"" with its wordless vocal hooks and relentless beat, makes a good candidate for a second single, capable of moving even the most sedentary posteriors. The album closes with the string-laden ballad ""Run Wild,"" a surprisingly tender and straight-forward acoustic love song graced by a simple harmonica part and lyrics that display an honest devotion to a lover. Gilbert's keyboard mixes brilliantly with the string arrangement for a stirring bridge that leads into the uncharacteristically joyful refrain of ""good times around the corner,"" which hints at an optimism for the future that has rarely surfaced in New Order's songs. Sumner caps it off with the simple sentiment, ""I'm gonna live 'til I die/ I'm gonna live to get high."" All told, Get Ready is a pretty solid effort from a veteran band that really has nothing left to prove. They've managed to bring together a consistently rewarding set of songs and added yet another great album to their already impressive canon. Unfortunately, the songwriting at times reveals scattered holes, and the songs can draw on for too long. But if nothing else, Get Ready proves that New Order are still capable of putting out an enjoyable album. Let's just hope they don't stay away for eight more years before they give us the next one.","It's been a long time since we've heard from New Order, hasn't it? A full eight years ...

Pity the Fool: Experiments in Therapy Behind the Mask of Music While Handing Out Dummy Smacks,Mr. Len,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ed5e6ef9596932393d/1:1/w_160/15e61243.jpg,2001-11-18 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5473-pity-the-fool-experiments-in-therapy-behind-the-mask-of-music-while-handing-out-dummy-smacks/,Matador,"For more than six years, DJ Mr. Len made up one-third of the acclaimed underground hip-hop trio Company Flow. Since CoFlow underwent their ""amicable split"" last year, Mr. Len has been on his own. Suffice it to say, he's doing just fine. And his first solo album, Pity the Fool, is the proof. When it comes to MCs, Len uses many of them. By the time you've reached the end of Pity the Fool's 16 tracks, you've heard nearly 20 different individuals-- from Steady Roc, to the Arsonist's Q-Unique, to Atlanta up-and-comers Massinfluence. This gives the disc diversity not just in vocal delivery, but also in attitude and content. You've got the ever-amusing Chubb Rock ""changing colors like iMacs"" and puffing his skills on ""Dummy Smacks""; Jean Grae vamping about a Columbine-style teen rampage on the nine-minute epic ""Taco Day""; Lord Sear, pleading with his rotund ""big-chocolate-shake-drinkin', no Ultra-Slimfast usin'"" love-interest to never change on ""Girl (Got to Give It to Me)."" Maybe it's Mr. Len's effect on his collaborators, but every one of them sounds relaxed and confident, like there's nothing better or easier than rapping over a Len track. If the MCs are diverse, the beats are Tiger Woods. The whole thing sounds like a well-planned mix tape: although no two tracks are the same, you can tell they're the product of the same imagination. Two ends of the spectrum are ""Get Loose"" and ""Force Fed."" ""Get Loose,"" featuring the admirable flow of Massinfluence, is built around the kind of dirty super-wah'd bassline that could have come straight off of Miles' On the Corner. The Pantera-like heavy metal of ""Force Fed,"" meanwhile, replaces the funk with confrontation and aggression, courtesy of Agents of Man and Amplifire. One of the album's standouts, ""Dummy Smacks,"" builds around an upbeat, funky horn section, but separates Chubb Rock's from Mr. Live's verses with five different ten-second interludes, including a Gregorian drone, a dark electronic sample and some soulful blues-fella setting up a Chubb verse by expressing, ""There's something I've wanted to say for a long, long time."" The interludes cut up the beat nicely, keeping the horns sounding persistent and fresh. Len is clearly in touch with his ass, and makes it known with his mastery of beat-dynamics, modulating them by adding choruses, bridges, or just letting a bassline drop out of the mix, to leave only a breakbeat. ""Get Loose"" is a prime example-- its orchestration is steady throughout, but after a few minutes, the mix suddenly opens up like it went from mono to stereo. I'm constantly baffled by what constitutes hip-hop's ""underground."" Apparently, the term has nothing to do with obscurity, novelty or musical subversion, because Pity the Fool is ""underground,"" and it's none of the above. Neither is it a disc rife with musical surprises, abstract concepts or ideological enlightenment. It's simply bold, street-level hip-hop with plenty of verve and attitude-- exactly what you wish they'd play on the radio.","For more than six years, DJ Mr. Len made up one-third of the acclaimed underground hip-hop trio Company Flow.

Stories Part Five,Stilluppsteypa,by: Christopher F.

So far, it's proven to be a pretty mild case-- I only notice the ringing during near-silence-- but I decided it would be a good idea to take some precautions to avoid further damage. I bought several pairs of ear plugs (at the ridiculous price of $15/pair) that claim to ""evenly distribute the dampening of sound across the frequency spectrum."" I even schedule silence breaks to give my throbbing eardrums a proper rest. One good thing has come out of this, though: the police have stopped coming to my house about noise complaints. I've been anticipating the latest full-length from the Iceland born-and-bred trio Stilluppsteypa since last year's subtly melodic EP, Not a Laughing Matter, but Rather a Matter of Laughs. When I received Stories Part Five-- recently released on Mille Plateaux's Ritornell imprint-- I experienced quite a scare: I feared my condition had dramatically worsened. The tremolo clicks and phase drones of the opening track, ""Nice Things to File Away FOREVER!,"" caught me off-guard. While not quite as discomforting as my aural ailment, the song's electronics are sublimated to the point that the sound coming from the speakers approaches ubiquity (not unlike tinnitus). ""Nice Things"" approaches ten minutes as collapsing raygun pulses and discordant static buzz at high pitches, yet synthesis is never blatant. As the record drones on, a pattern emerges: minimalist glitch tendencies with glimpses of beat-keeping allow the synth's atmospheric delay lines to seep through to the fore. Stilluppsteypa avoid the contemporary construct of ""intelligence"" in electronic music by keeping their organic explorations to the role of sound itself. Melody feels incidental, but hardly contrived; percussion is sparse and precise, but strangely warm, even in its digital synthesis. Static hums are prevalent, but they function as integral rather than ornamental. And though it resembles a rusted metal shed, there's a purveyed ambiance here that's as intriguing as it is unsettling. It's often headache-inducing, too, if listened to for extended periods of time. Steady rhythmic patterns are only present on half of these twelve tracks, but when they are, they permeate unchanged. Of course, the patterns used are anything but conventional. ""Love Brother (of the Parent's House)"" pulses and clicks in a bumbling 9/8 time, and the brief set closer, ""We Sure Could Do With Some Help,"" is something like an odd samba, which is a bizarre considering that the rest of the album is almost completely undanceable. ""All Drummers Shiver"" locks into a filtered, high-speed gallop-- accompanied by swells of drone and hiss-- which fades into the dirty squeaks of ""Some Help."" With Stories Part Five, Stilluppsteypa have created an organic aural space from the inorganic. They play the studio like an instrument, trading in notes and structure for circularity, clicks, and drones that surge with a deranged sense of life. In fact, I was listening to the album outside while taking a noonday stroll and was overcome with a strange sense of deconstruction in the natural environment. And this would be Stilluppsteypa's gimmick if all groups had to have one: they seem to invert the natural and the inorganic.","I'm starting to face the fact that I have tinnitus.

We Are A&C,Arling and Cameron,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0fbb1335d7bf169814a/1:1/w_160/4bfb562f.jpg,2001-11-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/285-we-are-ac/,Emperor Norton,"The only thing that could prevent you from exposure to music from Arling and Cameron's third album, We Are A&C;, would be packing your bags and moving to the moon. Trust me. Even if you never step into a record shop, you will fall victim to the duo's precisely organized obnoxiousness. No boutique, no mall, no gas station pump, no sports arena, no roadhouse will be unmolested by the dismal facile jollity that Arling and Cameron concoct. Allow me to illustrate this with an indisputable fact, which has been verified by several U.N. agencies as well as ASCAP. The first broadcast on post-Taliban Afghan radio was a Pashtun-language ad for Old Navy performance fleeces, backed by an Arling and Cameron song. D'oh! After six years of no music, no television and no relief from militia-enforced beard itch, most Afghanis naturally welcomed such a spritely, happy ditty. But the people of the free world have a solemn duty to tell our recently liberated brothers and citizens that music can be more than just a mind-erasing jingle. Is it going too far to state that Arling and Cameron are terrorists, hell-bent on the banalization of music? Probably. But just in case the Dutch duo plan to wreak hideous destruction, I'm duty-bound to advise you all in the severest terms that if you suspect you or those you care for are being exposed to Arling and Cameron: Cover your ears. Leave the establishment that is host to these pernicious melodies. Inform your local F.B.I. office without delay. Now that I've outlined the procedures, I should probably run down what you're likely to encounter. I will illustrate what you're to be alert for with reference to tracks from their latest and most heinous collection, We Are A&C;. Arling and Cameron take Kraftwerk's Autobahn into lushly harmonized surf-pop on ""5th Dimension."" Amid all the blips, beeps, and swirls, the pair blithely chant, ""The man machine is on a roll/ Getting closer to our goal/ Total freedom of the soul."" ""B.B. Electro"" blasts its horns, ready for a fun-car commercial. When another GM-affiliated manufacturer releases its latest VW Beetle lookalike, there is a 99.5% certainty that ""B.B. Electro"" will be used as its signature tune. On ""Up,"" a nameless diva shouts for you to ""get it up"" over Duane Eddy-style twang guitar. ""Up"" has been mechanized for maximum brain-suck during afternoon rummages through the sale racks at Urban Outfitters. The robotically generated, faux-trip-hop ""Walk on the Wild Side"" rip-off, ""We Are A&C;"" blatantly declares that Arling and Cameron are clones. With lines such as, ""Two fruits from a musical tree/ We are A&C;,"" these guys leave me in little doubt that they're determined to become the Siegfried and Roy of kitsch dance-pop. The cod-reggae electro fusion ""Coconut Conga"" is infectious, like smallpox, while the bouncy Pizzicato Five-goes-lightly-jungle ""Can You Pah-Pah?"" will arouse the passion of a thousand post-irony hipsters who will moan into their Campari and sodas that this dreck hasn't yet been issued on 8-track. ""Born in June"" is a tender, hanky-waving diva ballad that even Diane Warren wouldn't have had a hand in. Yup, it's that shit. The professional, Bacharach-y ""Sunday"" could be the basis for a standout High Llamas song if Arling and Cameron had bothered to add any lyrics beyond ""ba-ba-ba-barabaa"" and some really arse whistling. Closing with 60 seconds of campy, polka-dotted Le Tigre-isms on ""Don't You Fuck,"" Arling and Cameron attempt to prove that, though they're terribly good at horsing around, they're not to be messed with. At their least offensive, Arling and Cameron are sickeningly self-congratulatory. If, like V/VM or Stock, Hausen and Walkman, the pair's smash-and-grab schtick had any bollocks, I'd be enthusiastic. I'd be mildly turned on if they had Pizzicato Five's panache or Bertrand Burgalat's harmonic invention. But We Are A&C; is feckless junk. Handsomely and repeatedly rewarded for being the burglars of pop culture, Arling and Cameron are touting flimsily fashioned sweat-shop counterfeits of far more stylish songs. In other words, We Are A&C; is perfect for in-store play at Old Navy. Consider yourselves forewarned.","The only thing that could prevent you from exposure to music from Arling and Cameron's third album, We Are ...

Life Is Full of Possibilities,Dntel,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e15e6ef95969322a84/1:1/w_160/ee81636e.jpg,2001-11-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2397-life-is-full-of-possibilities/,Plug Research,"The title of Dntel's third album is really ringing true these days. Who'd have thought that our lives would bear witness to bioterrorism and mass destruction? Even the album cover tacitly cautions against optimism. Yes, life might bring you a million dollar check one day, but as symbolized by the ambulance on Life Is Full of Possibilities' artwork, the envelope could be smeared with anthrax spores. Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello couldn't have known of present hazards when he put together this uniformly superb album; what he did know was that it was time to progress as an artist. Dntel's previous albums-- released on the maverick Californian extreme IDM label, Phthalo-- showcased Tamborello's mastery of the \xB5-Ziq form. Both Early Works for Me If It Works for You and Something Always Goes Wrong are heavily indebted to Mike Paradinas' askance appreciation of melody and spastic beat programming. Tamborello's transition from slinging ""Eno-core"" bass bricks in his first band (the Los Angeles-based ambient pop band Strictly Ballroom) to creating exemplary IDM appeared effortless. And though Something Always Goes Wrong didn't demonstrate much desire to explore uncharted sonic realms, it remained an engaging and rewarding listen. But with Life Is Full of Possibilities, Tamborello separates himself from the tired, poor and huddled masses of bedroom programmers. Enlisting members of the West Coast indie elite, the album is a matchless combination of scratchy indie rock and post-Oval electronics. What impresses most about the record, beyond the strength of the songs, is Tamborello's willingness to treat his vocalists as he would a synth tone. Most musicians are content to let their guests contribute a couple of lines and leave it at that-- at most, they'll tack on a cheeseball vocoder effect. Tamborello takes it a step further, cutting up and contorting members of Beachwood Sparks, That Dog, and Death Cab for Cutie. Tamborello crinkles and manipulates vocalist Chris Gunst, the frontman for both Strictly Ballroom and Beachwood Sparks. But this is more than a bassist's revenge on his former band's lead singer. As Gunst sings the first lines to ""Umbrella,"" Tamborello inserts micropauses into the phonemes Gunst utters. When Gunst's nostrum, ""You can turn the city upside down if you want to/ But it won't keep you dry,"" appears for a second time, Tamborello clothes it with a delicate vacuum cleaner sound. On its third appearance, Gunst's voice appears au natural; instead, it's the accompaniment-- a church organ and a swarm of ambience swirls-- that Tamborello alters before a relatively conventional drum machine beat kicks ""Umbrella"" through the classic-opening-track goal posts. As superb as ""Umbrella"" is, it's not a patch on ""Anywhere Anyone,"" a track which features L.A. performance poet and singer/songwriter Mia Doi Todd, who provided the recent Dublab compilation, Freeways, with its best moment: ""Digital Version 2.1."" In Tamborello, Todd has found her musical soulmate. As she plaintively sings, ""How can you love me if you don't love yourself,"" Tamborello's accompaniment swoons and swoops in its dense coverings, until a tinny xylophone chimes through with the most delicate of melodies and accompaniments. It's similar in effect to the way Björk uses harp lines amid the fuzz and static of Vespertine's glitchier moments. The drifting aleatoric ambience of ""Pillowcase"" reminds me of David Kristian's Roomtone sonic sculptures. Sounds waft by or linger barely long enough to register as rhythmic or melodic phrases. ""Fear of Corners,"" in its crackled way, vies with Aaliyah and Timbaland's ""Try Again"" for most rhythmically obtuse but still mad funky programming. Like ""Try Again,"" ""Fear of Corners"" is fearful of its inherent groove, and muffles it with smothering ambience. Nonetheless, the insuppressible and awkward beats persist with an Autechre-ish resilience. Tamborello's partner in the electro-pop act Figurine, Meredith Figurine, takes vocal duties on ""Suddenly is Sooner Than You Think."" Figurine tries her utmost to match Mia Doi Todd's heartfelt bleakness; instead, she has to settle for matching Dani Siciliano, the serene vocalist of Herbert's masterful Bodily Functions album. This is hardly a major concession, especially given that Tamborello's setting for the song appears to confirm to Matthew Herbert's Personal Contract for the Composition of Music manifesto. The only thing you might miss on this track is a fat beat, but the filigree lyrics and processed accordions would sound really crap with a two-step monster pattern humping away at them. Tamborello, like Herbert, has nobly allowed good taste to dictate his approach, rather than the prospect of a club hit. The title track begins as another David Kristian-style sound sculpture before transforming into ringing bells conversing with abstract noises that bubble up from the impenetrable deep. As such, Tamborello succinctly and accurately describes life's possibilities becoming actualities. ""Why I'm So Unhappy"" features former That Dog bassist, Rachel Haden. Haden collaborated with the For Carnation's Brain McMahan (also the ex-frontman of Slint) on the song's lyrics. But despite the track's pedigree, I'm distracted from the lyrics by the beauty of Haden's voice and how Tamborello frames it: in drifting strings and Björkish ambiance. Towards the end of the song, Tamborello forces every element-- Haden's voice, the sparse percussion, and the guitar-- through broken distortion. However excellent ""Why I'm So Unhappy"" is, it's eclipsed in brilliance by ""(This is) The Dream of Evan and Chan."" Death Cab for Cutie's Benjamin Gibbard guests and compliments Tamborello's most melodic, Eno-esque distortions with his wistful lyrics of nostalgia (""He then played every song from 1993/ The crowd applauded/ He curtsied bashfully). Tamborello brings in the sturdy beats that were such a staple of Something Always Goes Wrong, until Gibbard repeats, ""Until the telephone started ringing, ringing, ringing off."" At this point, the song slows and stills in preparation for the closing instrumental ""Last Songs."" Life Is Full of Possibilities confirms that, while possibilities exist in a quantum state of probability, it takes a special person to convert them into certainties. I've only become this ecstatic about one other album this year (Herbert's Bodily Functions), and Life Is Full of Possibilities exceeds even that landmark album. Possibly, it'll have an similar effect on you.","The title of Dntel's third album is really ringing true these days. Who'd have\n\ thought that our ...

Now It's Overhead,Now It's Overhead,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43a69fc7814a47cd825/1:1/w_160/05df671c.jpg,2001-11-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5852-now-its-overhead/,Saddle Creek,"Alright, first off, Now It's Overhead do not sound like the Cure. They don't sound like Depeche Mode, they don't sound like Spiritualized, and they sure as hell don't sound like My Blood Valentine. There can only be three reasons for critics to make such comparisons in their reviews: I'm guessing #3, primarily because the same comparisons are made in the band's promotional material. Likewise, about half of the web's reviews of this self-titled debut begin with the fact that Now It's Overhead is the first non-Nebraskan act signed to Saddle Creek. At least this promo factoid points us in the right direction, because Athens, Georgia is home to both Now It's Overhead and most of the Elephant 6 collective. They share a unique blend of psychedelic pop and indie rock, far from the darkwave and shoegazer tendencies you'd imagine from all those reviews. Like the individual Elephant 6 groups, the Now It's Overhead project arises from the vision of a singular songwriter. In this case, the iconic bandleader is Andy LeMaster, who wrote most of the songs and played a lot of the instruments. The band is rounded out by Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor, more commonly known as the lovely duo Azure Ray. They provide gentle backing harmonies to LeMaster's lead and play an assortment of keyboards that mix nicely with Clay Leverett's versatile drumming. LeMaster is one-third owner of Athens' Chase Park Transduction studio, and his recording experience is evident in the unique production work throughout, a mysterious aura both high in fidelity and abstract in definition. But despite all they have going for them, I just don't like a lot of these songs. Take the first, ""Blackout Curtain,"" for example. It starts promisingly enough, with the soft patter of percussion and the faintest hint of Azure Ray-style sighing in the background. Then guest vocalist Melissa Etheridge steps in. Except it's not her; it's just Andy LeMaster's twangy whine. Don't get me wrong-- I don't have anything against southern accents. It's just that his voice in particular pierces with its almost unbearably desperate pitch. Worse, after the verse builds into a hopeful mix of keyboard and acoustic guitar, the chorus goes all gospel. The instruments drop out in one of those calculated radio-hit moments and the voices rise in harmony: ""Don't ever go away from here, and I will never go away."" If there's any soul at all here, it's streaming on down from Billy Joel's ""River of Dreams."" Likewise, the second track lights up like an ELO epic, with the same ""ah-ah-ah"" electronic pulse. The lyrics might stab at your heart, though: ""Your goddamn uncle changed you some/ When you were five, more than once."" LeMaster narrates the runaway well, very Teena Brandon-esque; it's hard to mock a story about abuse. But this song is called ""Who's Jon,"" you see, and LeMaster short circuits everything with the kind of pap sentiment that Boys Don't Cry had the sense to avoid: ""Who's Jon anyway? What does it mean, what did you expect me to say?"" If only Number Five could appear and start breakdancing. He'd have more personality than this Jon D'oh. ""Hold Your Spin"" starts off nice with whispering keyboards that give way to a relentless, militaristic thump and LeMaster's distorted vocals. The song shifts suddenly to a bouncy Ben Folds-style bridge, accented by strange claps radiating from different spots in the speaker. But every incidence of pop decency seems spoiled by the goofy choruses: ""Were you born sideways? Did you have to rotate?"" In some ideal world, this music would be the catchy chatter on the radio. But I've realized that this is the same pop inanity I'd make fun of if it were all over the airwaves. Sure, ""6th Grade Roller"" is a great driving song, with its danceable beat, maracas and analog synth, but do you really need to hear, ""Fly around a ring/ I fly around a ring,"" repeated ad nauseum? It's been trapped in my head all day. The later songs lose the pop luster and gain lyrical sensitivity. ""Wonderful Scar"" links a childhood accident with growing up, and the simple electric guitar chords and cymbal crashes make it a touching vignette. LeMaster's twang softens as the album moves on, and his composition skills become evident. The sparse drums and piano on ""With a Subtle Look"" illustrate a painful absence as he sings, ""We started off across the room, locking eyes and subtle clues/ Connection then devotion grew, closer than our mothers knew... Now all the words we saved return to curse your name."" Voices spiral eerily in the background, a disembodied drone used again in the splintered percussion and humming ambience of the melancholy album closer, ""A Skeleton on Display."" Now It's Overhead is a very personal album. If you enjoy Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel or Elf Power, add a point or two to this rating. You might enjoy the combination of surreal production and unconventional rock, as well as LeMaster's ability to write songs that delve between the black-and-white into emotional complexity. But to compare: if Mercury Rev's Deserter's Songs illustrates its tale of relationships through a window into pastoral Americana, Now It's Overhead tells a fragmented tale of a boy's coming-of-age framed through some superficial tricks from popular radio. The moodiness is a pill that's sweetened to the point where I gag. So I can't help but warn: you might want to duck this one.","Alright, first off, Now It's Overhead do not sound like the Cure.

Strata Frames,Electric Birds,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2e13d197565213b26c/1:1/w_160/8d333313.gif,2001-11-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2725-strata-frames/,U-Cover,"One of the best things about discovering a new artist early in his career is the opportunity to follow the arc of his growth as it happens. When you explore the back catalog of an artist well past his prime, you're acting as an archeologist, sifting through the dusty fossils trying to figure out for yourself how the anklebone connects to the legbone. With an active and dynamic musician working through musical problems in the present day, each new release is unknowable to some degree, because there's no way to determine what will happen next. That's an exciting feeling. Mike Martinez of Electric Birds debuted in 2000 with a surprising self-titled album of varied, engrossing, and deeply emotional electronic music. Panorama followed in early 2001, an ultimately murky and disappointing affair after the superb execution of the debut, as it leaned too heavily on uninspired loops and lacked dynamics. Still, Martinez' talent was evident even on that mediocre effort, and his second release of 2001, Strata Frames, finds him returning to form as he refines his approach. Like Panorama, Strata Frames finds Electric Birds forgoing the variety of the debut in favor of steady, meticulous dissection of a handful of moods and textures. Martinez seems to be concentrating primarily on drones and ambient glitch with hints of dub and house rhythms. The tone once again is muted, with Martinez carefully threading veins of noise and static though the bubbly warmth of his synth programming. Even more than previous records, Strata Frames resembles the widescreen aquatic approach of Japan's wonderful Neina: complex ambient music with a slightly prickly edge. ""Strata 2"" gives instant notice that these dreamy tracks will be laced with dissonance. Buzzing static appears first, followed by a deep blue wave of drone that rises and falls like a time-lapse photograph of the tide. Bell tones chime through the middle section of the track, further extending the seaside metaphor. The visual imagery that both ""Strata 2"" and the darker ""Strata 5"" conjure doubles the listening pleasure. When beats appear on Strata Frames, they're of the suggestive, holographic variety. Kit Clayton is thanked on the album sleeve, and his influence is readily apparent in the strokes of digital dub painted onto ""Frames"" (where heavily equalized chords throb atop a gentle house beat) and the relatively harsh reverberating clicks of ""Sodona."" But these tracks, while engaging enough, are not what make Electric Birds special. Martinez' greatest talent is in constructing wistful, reflective moods from a palate of lush sounds. ""Pitch Patterns"" is my favorite here, the rare bit of electronic music that can get by on sound construction alone. The soft cloud of drone that shifts between two chords isn't doing anything a second-week piano student couldn't muster, but the timbre of the lead sound is so incredibly rich and evocative it carries the track on its own. It's the kind of patch anyone who has tinkered with a modular synth dreams of creating. A repeating percussion melody and downcast, barely audible drum programming complete this elegant piece. Not all of Strata Frames is up to the standard of ""Pitch Patterns,"" but it's enough to have me anticipating the next Electric Birds release.","One of the best things about discovering a new artist early in his career is the opportunity to follow the ...

The Golden Age,Bobby Conn,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11c9d034d5c69bf28ae/1:1/w_160/3ecdceb4.jpg,2001-11-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1579-the-golden-age/,Thrill Jockey,"Bobby Conn needs new friends. Sure, they're a talented bunch (John McEntire, for example), but friends are supposed to look out for your best interests; hence the common wisdom of ""friends don't let friends (drive drunk/vote Republican/go to Michigan State)."" Bobby Conn's friends apparently never got the message. They would probably never keep him from driving drunk, voting Republican or attending Michigan State. I say this because no one stopped Bobby. At any point, one of them could have said, ""Bobby, this The Golden Age thing. Man, I just think it's a bad idea. Are you sure you want to do this?"" But none did. They should all be ashamed, like you'd expect the friends who let friends drive Chevy trucks to be ashamed. I can imagine the scene, somewhere in Chicago; Bobby spends eight minutes jamming on the Virginia Slims motto, ""You've come a long way, baby."" Drummer Colby Stark hears it all. He knows the right thing to do. But Colby is afraid of Bobby, maybe because Bobby is more popular than him, or has a hot temper when he's making shitty music. So Colby relents, and appeases his self-absorbed collaborator: ""That sounds really tight, Bobby. Really deep."" The first time I heard that track I actually flicked-off my CD player. I send that middle-finger directly to you, Colby Stark. You should have known better. Wake up and start taking care of your friends. And whoever pianist Nick Sula is, he heard the following line, from the ""tongue-in-cheek"" (read: disgusting) folk ballad ""Whore,"" and kept his mouth shut: ""I'll be working on your street/ Missing half my teeth/ Give another gummy blowjob/ Get myself something good to eat."" You had your chance, Nick, and you failed. Now go to confession. The reasons for never buying this album extend far beyond the irritating lyrics. Bobby Conn's vocal theatrics will make you ill. They reminded me of Meat Loaf crossbred with Rob Halford. His falsetto is one of the worst I've ever heard. Furthermore, it seems that Bobby Conn also lacks songwriting ability. Songs meander with forgettable melodies and all kinds of twists and turns that bear no relationship to one another, other than that they're all copped from 70s glam rock, prog rock and funk. On the P-Funk-cum-Robbie Williams tune ""No Revolution,"" for example, Bobby breathes some Bootsy Collins into a chunky left-hand bassline. It sounds alright for a minute, until the trite, happy-time chorus takes over, declaring that, ""There will be no revolution here,"" which, coincidentally, was exactly what I was thinking for the larger part of The Golden Age. None of this even touches on the demeanor of the album's purveyor. Bobby Conn's errors might be forgivable if they were innocent and humble. But they're clearly not-- I've read a few interviews with the guy, and suffice it to say, Bobby Conn is fond of Bobby Conn. It's almost as if thinks he's playing a trick on rock and roll, offering some kind of witty, sarcastic commentary on the genre. Or maybe he's being serious. Who knows? Furthermore, who cares? Whatever Bobby Conn was aiming for with The Golden Age came out amateurish and obnoxious. With that, we can add one more proverb to the list: friends don't let friends listen to Bobby Conn.","Bobby Conn needs new friends.

BBC Sessions +,Faust,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6913d197565213b52d/1:1/w_160/2af92dac.gif,2001-11-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3018-bbc-sessions/,RecommendedReR,"""They were crazy; we were all crazy-- we had a code of honor that said: no compromises; we could do absolutely what we feel like with no respect for anybody and no consideration of any consequences no matter what."" -- Jean-Hervé Peron, May 2000 This was the Faust way; a band whose members may never have considered what kind of influence they would have on the future of rock and shock and everything in decent civilization. And anyone who hears them either understands Peron's code or goes home disappointed (or frustratingly off-put) with the music. For me, one of the great things about many of the classic Krautrock bands is their familial ethics, wherein the individual only exists in relation to the whole, and the end result is always more than the sum of the parts. Faust was communal like that, and Faust was classic. Interestingly, thirty years of rumination on what possible inspiration (besides the drugs, of course) might have pushed Faust to make such wonderful noise has left very little concrete information. We know that they were six strong, then five, and that they had something of a guardian angel watching over them and providing them with the bare necessities-- food, money, manufactured importance to their record company-- in Uwe Nettlebeck. We know that they worked and lived in a small, abandoned schoolhouse in Wümme for a time, and that most of what came out of that schoolhouse gave the alternative education to innocent and willing students everywhere. One thing we don't know is exactly how it all came to pass in Wümme. Jean-Hervé Peron and the rest of the remaining members (including Nettlebeck and engineer Kurt Graupner) have all given interviews detailing what went down in during those sessions, and relatively insignificant details have come out over time: most of the music was recorded on eight-track; the group would often spend days in one room recording without a producer to tell them if they were on to something; they often built pieces up like parts of chain because they'd recorded so many disparate elements at different times. When I read these things, they seem like mostly technical revelations, but nothing ever tells me about the impetus of the music. Where did it come from? So, Julian Cope calls Faust the most ""mythical"" of the original Krautrock bands, and I suppose it makes sense. The only thing we have from them that's anything like informative is the music. They left their humble schoolhouse in 1973 for the Manor (courtesy of omni-label Virgin), and made an album that was predictably wonderful, but more refined-- and possibly more civilized-- than their earlier works. Faust left behind most of their wildest dreams in Wümme. So that it turns out we have a tad more to digest than we thought-- with the release of BBC Sessions +-- is good news. It's almost great. BBC Sessions + collects any remaining material not issued on the first three proper Faust studio albums or their compilation, 71 Minutes of Faust, and adds some music in alternate mixes that appeared elsewhere. The disc had previously only been available as part of the absolutely essential Wümme Years box set, but has now been issued separately, I guess for anyone who has all the remastered original albums and yet didn't buy the box. No guilt trip here though, because this album works well on its own, even if you still have no excuse for not owning all the proper albums. There, I've said my piece. As it happens, there's only one track here that had anything to with a BBC session, and even that is dubious. ""BBC 1.3.73,"" containing ""The Lurcher,"" ""Kraut Rock"" and ""Do So,"" was put together by the band for broadcast on a BBC radio show. It's not a live Faust performance, and in fact, it contains two-thirds previously released material, albeit with alternate mixes. ""The Lurcher"" is an atypically appropriately titled funk-rock tune, featuring Peron's maxi-bass and some very nice sax work. With its mid-tempo swamp groove and echo effects, it almost manages to sound like space-jazz contemporaries such as Donald Byrd or Headhunters-era Herbie Hancock. Of course, Faust always had too many rough edges to ever really sound like anyone else, and this bit of new information fits into the canon as easily as ein, zwei, drei. ""Kraut Rock,"" to my ears, is the same as the first song on Faust IV, though it's mixed slightly differently, perhaps a bit less claustrophobic. The liner notes list no information to dispute this, but I've never read anything from the members of Faust about doing this. It's interesting to note that this version of the song actually appeared before IV's, because the BBC tape aired several months before Faust finished that album. ""Do So"" is an elongated version of the ""Stretch Out Time"" section of The Faust Tapes. This version is a little slower, emphasizing guitar and groove more than the original, and it doesn't feature the sax doubling the melody in the chorus. A curio? For completists? Well, we're not done yet. ""Party 9"" is the end of ""Munic/Yesterday"" from 71 Minutes until it turns into a completely different tune midway through (similar to ""Giggy Smile"" from IV). ""(360)"" is a disorienting piece of German radio broadcast spliced with what sounds like a game of ping-pong and a dog barking in the background. Then, some boogie-woogie piano comes in, and kids begin shouting, ""Happy birthday to you!"" in broken English. After that, ""Party 10"" enters without a break, as a fanfare of sped-up trumpet enters along with something like a wet kazoo. The previously unreleased ""Party 1"" is a fantastic example of the kind of exotic ethnomusicology experiment Faust could come up with on a moment's notice. It begins as a Latin-funk solo drum extravaganza, interspersed with electro-distortions and kinetic tom fills. But just as you make room for an ad-hoc dance-floor in the living room, it stops, leading to ""We Are the Hallo Men."" This tune originally appeared on a 1986 release, Munich and Elsewhere, which was later compiled on 71 Minutes. ""Hallo Men,"" however, was left off 71 Minutes due to space considerations, so its tripped-out gutbucket funk was prematurely hidden from the ears of 21st Century fans. Phased mellotron and stream-of-consciousness proclamations give it that extra jais ne se quoi of all the best Faust music. The album closes with ""So Far"" and ""Meer,"" both alternate takes of tracks from So Far and 71 Minutes, respectively. As a whole, this album makes absolutely no sense, pulling elements from several great Faust releases, but seemingly randomly as if the whole thing is just an excuse to cull everything that didn't fit anywhere else. And who knows, maybe that's what it is, but I prefer to think of it as the most recent in a line of efforts to bring out every known ""fact"" about this band to the fore. When everything was over (before it got started again in the early 90s with the reunion albums), I imagine Faust's first fans were either still reeling from the dazzling display of inspired madness of the classic albums, or busy starting their own riots with punk and new wave. Of course, I would strongly urge anyone who hasn't heard the proper albums to check those out well before delving into BBC Sessions +.","""They were crazy; we were all crazy-- we had a code of honor that said: no\n\ compromises; we could ...

Pleasure of Ruins,Saturnine,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35c5e6ef95969320623/1:1/w_160/d93702f3.gif,2001-11-14 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7005-pleasure-of-ruins/,Motorcoat,"""The first thing to do is to kill all the lawyers."" -- Shakespeare, King Henry VI*, part 2, act IV, scene II* ""Do like Shakespeare said, all them pecker-heads oughta be dead."" -- Mojo Nixon, ""No Dishes No More"" Maybe the above suggestions are a little drastic, but after hearing this fifth LP from New York City's Saturnine, I think it's time we consider at least preventing lawyers from forming rock bands. Well, except for the Wrens and Pearls Before Swine. But that's it. No one else. And certainly not Saturnine, a pack of indie rock holdouts from the class of '94 whose core members-- bassist Mike Donofrio and guitarist/vocalist Matt Gallaway-- formed the band while in law school at NYU. Sadly, the most interesting thing about Pleasure of Ruins is the album artwork, or rather, lack thereof. It's completely covered in text. Front, back, inside, even the CD itself is blanketed in a winding, labyrinthine, footnote-and-digression-happy chronicle of the band's history. It's the stuff of a Borges short story. Two telling snippets from the lengthy tale: ""Now we're waiting for the early mid-nineties to roar back with the vengeance of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the 1992 Stanley Cup quarterfinals,"" and, ""Now that we have jobs and careers, we don't really care about the latest trends in indie rock."" Dealing with the first quote, plenty of bands sound stuck in the early mid-nineties, but few sound so completely taken by Gin Blossoms jangle that they feel the need to erect a immovable monument to it smack in the middle of the ever-flowing river of time. This is music in the preservationist vein. And what makes Pleasure of Ruins almost ridiculous is that the time period it seeks to forever dwell in has basically just ended. I mean, isn't it a little early for this kind of nostalgia? It's not like the album is completely unlistenable or anything. In fact, Pleasure of Ruins is completely inoffensive indie rock. The band is fairly tight, sounding equal parts early Cure and early R.E.M. And Matt Gallaway's voice plays it up, emulating a less haggard Michael Stipe. At times, the band even steps away from complete and utter blandness with, well, something slightly less bland. Take the opening track, ""When We Were Anchors for the Sun,"" for example. It's a nice-enough piece of jangle-pop with passable, if unmemorable lyrics (sample: ""We've made a circle in the sand/ We have no hunger and I think we have no thirst to buy the land""), and its only cringe-inducing moment comes with ""The History of Cleveland,"" which ponders the question, ""Whatever happened to a band like Hüsker Dü?/ They should have been made superstars/ I doubt they made much money."" Hmm. Indeed. But what makes this album below average is hinted at in the second of the above quotes. I'm glad the boys in Saturnine have ""real jobs"" and don't have the time or inclination to keep up with trends, but apparently, they don't have time to try anything new or particularly interesting, either. Maybe they're just a little too comfortable, I don't know, but the band seems to approach Pleasure of Ruins as if there's nothing at stake, and therefore, takes few risks. And, as any music fan knows, no risks means no fun. Sure, sometimes it's nice to sit back and listen to music that expects nothing from you. But when it's also passionless, and draws its inspiration from Del Amitri, it's not something you want to go around spending your money on. Save it for law school.","*""The first thing to do is to kill all the lawyers.""

The Photo Album,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8db13d1975652139761/1:1/w_160/a71c27a0.jpg,2001-11-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2230-the-photo-album/,Barsuk,"I've always enjoyed looking at photo albums. Whether I know the people in them or not is pretty irrelevant. There's something about the medium of photography that just strikes me. Maybe it's just the possibility of stumbling across an accidental work of art-- that one shot where all the visual elements are balanced perfectly and someone exposes perhaps more of their personality than they intended. People can't really hide from a camera; it catches everything, be it a touch of nervousness in the smiles of a newlywed couple or the momentary pain of exertion on an athlete's face. It seems as though Ben Gibbard, on his latest outing with Death Cab for Cutie, the band's third album in just three years, has attempted to capture in his lyrics the verbal equivalent of amateur photography. That's not to say there's anything amateur about the poetry in his lyrics-- quite the contrary, in fact-- but he captures those same little secondary emotions of the moment that cameras capture so well. Add to this the fact that every song here contains at least one vividly rendered image in its lyrics, and The Photo Album, rotten pun aside, seems a fairly appropriate title. The album opens quietly with the brief, sleepy ""Steadier Footing,"" a glimpse at a relationship that seems fated not to be. The organs, loosely strummed guitar and softly struck floor toms conjure a dead-on after-party atmosphere-- quiet, empty, a little smoky. From there, the band heads into ""A Movie Script Ending,"" which feels the most like a logical extension of their work on last year's We Have the Facts and Are Voting Yes of any song here. The spacious drumming, intertwining guitar arpeggios and Gibbard's impassioned tenor pour forth a thick syrup of melody in the verses and chorus, before an unfortunately awkward bridge disrupts the flow of the song. Such moments haunt the remainder of the album, as well, though they're generally not too distracting. ""We Laugh Indoors"" suffers a bit from too-long instrumental passages centering on wandering, loosely connected guitar phrases, but drummer Michael Schorr keeps things moving with his insistent backbeat, and the band finds their way before long. Still, form-wise, the song is oddly constructed and fairly easy to tune out. ""Information Travels Faster"" kicks off with one of Gibbard's best opening lines. ""I intentionally wrote it out to be an illegible mess/ You wanted me to write you letters, but I'd rather lose your address,"" he sings, as the band provides a steady backing for him and his atmospheric piano playing. The most gripping song musically, though, is also one of the most lyrically puzzling songs Gibbard has ever penned. I'm curious if Gibbard simply had an especially bad experience in Los Angeles or something, because ""Why You'd Want to Live Here"" is intensely bitter. Lines like, ""I can't see why you'd want to live here,"" ""It's a lovely summer's day and I can almost see a skyline through a thickening shroud of egos/ Is this the city of angels or demons,"" and, ""You can't swim in a town this shallow,"" make me wonder if he even tried to find something he liked about the city before he wrote the song. But while the unrelentingly negative lyrics may be hard to digest, the music certainly isn't. It's like swallowing arsenic with candy-- the sweet melody and passionate delivery cause the song to jump out of the pack as one of the few actually capable of lodging in your brain. Similarly malicious is ""Styrofoam Plates,"" though the vitriol expressed toward the narrator's departed father is a little more understandable when you consider the full story laid out in the song's lyrics. ""It's no stretch to say you were not quite a father/ But a donor of seeds/ To a poor single mother/ Who would raise us alone/ We never saw the money/ That went down your throat through the hole in your belly,"" is a spiteful mouthful to be sure, and it seems quite plausible that Gibbard is writing autobiographically, though I won't purport to know his family history. One thing you may have noticed by now is that Gibbard has a tendency to sing in full, grammatically correct sentences. This marks him as a unique lyricist to be sure, but the downside is that it sometimes forces him to jam a bunch of syllables that don't flow very well into a melodic phrase. This makes for more than a few moments where you wonder if he wouldn't be better off resorting to a more succinct form. Thankfully, though, he has enough facility with his style that it doesn't hurt the music too much-- witness the pop excellence of ""I Was a Kaleidoscope,"" a song that serves as a good reminder of why Death Cab were relentlessly compared to Built to Spill in the early stages of their career. Chris Walla's guitar hook shares the foreground nicely with Gibbard, who offers lines like, ""My teeth chattered rhythms/ They were grouped in twos and threes/ Like a Morse code message from me to me."" John Vanderslice and Sean Nelson offer backing vocals to fill out the sound. The Photo Album comes to a curious close as ""Debate Exposes Doubt"" collapses into quiet but dissonant piano and guitar figures, eventually petering out completely. Overall, it reads like a look through some stranger's photo album-- there are a lot incredible images contained within it, but there are also a few embarrassing shots and the occasional moment in time that isn't framed quite right. Still, the good outweighs the bad by a fair shot and it's more than enough to wonder what kind of images the band has yet to treat us to.","I've always enjoyed looking at photo albums.

Tomahawk,Tomahawk,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d513d19756521394ef/1:1/w_160/2b76f854.jpg,2001-11-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8098-tomahawk/,Ipecac,"My friend Danielle insists that Mike Patton is a ""greasy-ass son-of-a-bitch."" I've never really given much thought to his sleaziness, but my impression of Patton has always been of this convulsive, hyperactive kid who never stands still, always screaming and jumping around. This has been especially true in his recent musical output, as Patton has schemed with an ever-increasing number of co-conspirators, including Merzbow, John Zorn, Kid606, Dan the Automator, Melt-Banana, Bob Ostertag, and Sepultura-- not to mention his record label, Ipecac, or his spastic vocal work with Faith No More, Mr. Bungle and Fantômas. So, Mike Patton's post-Faith No More days have been quite demanding. And now, as if he didn't have enough on his plate, he's put together the semi-supergroup Tomahawk. Tomahawk finds Patton joining forces with three lesser-known guys from three well-known bands-- Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison, Melvins bassist Kevin Rutmanis, and Helmet drummer John Stanier-- for a project that attempts to continue his recent genre-defying leanings. Mr. Bungle is often typified by the band's ability to leap musical borders in a single bound, seamlessly blending genres like heavy metal, polka and surf guitar. Tomahawk, while much less prone to these rapid, schizophrenic musical shifts, is still dipping its fingers into a number of different territories, with a tremendous bent towards Patton's style of heavy metal and a twisted, barely recognizable brand of country. I suppose the fact that Tomahawk convened in Nashville to record the album may have something to do with their oblique take on country music. It doesn't much matter who Patton's playing with here because, like almost any project in which he's involved, the showcase in Tomahawk is on Patton's vocals and lyrics. At times, he'll whisper in a low-key croon; other times, he'll turn into the monster under your bed, howling out these outlandish visions at the top of his lungs. Lyrically, he's still penning the same ghoulish, b-horror-movie tales about murderous hitchhikers, gruesome deaths, and coming-of-age sexual deviance, but the carnival dementia emblematic of much of the Bungle work is laid aside here in favor of a warped rural landscape. A country noir, perhaps? No matter what Patton is singing, I just can't shake the feeling that all these scenes are taking place in the dead of night-- on deserted highways or in abandoned mobile homes out in the middle of the woods-- with sinister-looking shadows creeping all around. And this is one of the things that makes Mike Patton one of the greatest male vocalists around today. He's got a voice with the uncanny ability to drop you right into the song, whether it's defying gravity on one of his nightmare carnival rides, or sitting across the seat from a demented hitchhiker, gun to your temple. There's a handful of incredible tracks here, like ""Flashback,"" in which Patton weaves a yarn about dysfunctional childhood memories recalled through hypnosis: ""Did they make you wear a dress/ Did they?/ Did they laugh and make you watch/ Did they?"" or ""Bend over and we'll hush the squealing/ Put on the mask and dance for Daddy."" Of course, this is pretty disturbing territory for most lyricists, but it's everyday stomping ground for the guy who wrote ""Love Is a Fist."" Elsewhere, we've got the ode to car-jacking, ""101 North,"" that finds Patton growling in a deep, gruff voice, and ""POP 1,"" in which he repeatedly screams the refrain, ""This beat could win me a Grammy,"" over a spattering of Stanier's drum fills. A rage-filled scream festival, ""Sir Yes Sir"" is spastic hardcore that finds Tomahawk blaring full-speed a la John Zorn's Naked City over layered screaming of the title phrase. The band's perverse style of country music is especially noticeable on tracks like ""Cul de Sac"" and ""Laredo."" The former is a brief lo-fi number-- mainly acoustic guitar and Patton's voice buried under hissing, scratchy production. The result is an exquisite track that stands out from everything else here. With lines like, ""Sunbathing on the shores of a nightmare/ I wish you were here,"" this is as close as Patton gets to a straight-up love song. Unfortunately, Patton's trademark voice and nefarious lyrics are the best things Tomahawk has going. With the exception of Denison's guitar work and some fine electronics manipulation, the rest of the band is just backup for Patton's madman ravings and crazed vocalizing. The problem is that, given his recent musical output, it's easy to raise the bar for anything with Patton's name associated with it. You might make the mistake of venturing into Tomahawk expecting some new genre-hopping adventure similar to Mr. Bungle's California. But, for maybe the first time, what Patton and his new cronies have released here is really just more of the same. Part Jesus Lizard, part Helmet and Melvins, part California-era Bungle, and part Angel Dust-era Faith No More, Tomahawk is about as straightforward as Mike Patton has played it in recent memory. Not a rehash by any means, but definitely breaking no new ground. Maybe that crazed hyperactive kid got tired on the musical playground and decided to take a rest. In Patton's case, I guess that means some more evil, bone-crushing rock 'n' roll, which ain't such a bad thing now, is it?","My friend Danielle insists that Mike Patton is a ""greasy-ass son-of-a-bitch.""\n\ I've never really given much thought to ...

"10,000 Light Years",Zeni Geva,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab3dc0084474cd0c1329/1:1/w_160/111b8408.jpg,2001-11-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8941-10000-light-years/,Neurot,"K.K. Null is a living legend in Japan, and approaching that status elsewhere. He started out playing punk noise in the early 80s (akin to early Boredoms), but found his first run of fame with the alt-prog trio YBO2, a group that also gave an early limelight to Ruins leader Tatsuya Yoshida and SSE labelhead Kitamura Masashi. However, as a guitarist, vocalist and electronic musician, Null very quickly learned to multitask, often playing in two or three projects simultaneously. In addition to dozens of solo recordings (working with Western luminaries such as Steve Albini, Jim O'Rourke, John Zorn and Fred Frith, and Japanese artists such as Merzbow, Otomo Yoshihide and Seiichi Yamamoto), he's been associated with almost as many bands as a member (the aforementioned YBO2, Zeni Geva, A.N.P., the Hanatarash, Terminal Hz) or producer (Melt Banana, Lewd). Now he's the head of his own label, Nux, and to cover that important indie credibility issue he's also toured in support of Sonic Youth. Similar to his former bandmate, Yoshida, Null works so frequently and with so many people, you might wonder if he hasn't occasionally spread himself a little thin. Also like Yoshida, he tends to compartmentalize his projects; that is, he works with O'Rourke, Frith or Merzbow to record live guitar improvisations, goes it alone for his electronic releases, or plays with his rock trio Zeni Geva when he wants to get a little heavy. This might explain why his releases maintain such a consistent level of interest and creativity-- when focusing on one thing at a time, but over several brainstorming sessions each year, Null's discography has come out looking as far-reaching and convoluted as, well, those of O'Rourke, Zorn and Albini. Zeni Geva has been active since 1987 from Tokyo (though he toured with American thrash and grindcore bands such as the Melvins and Pain Teens very early in their careers), and is Null's answer to grindcore and the eternally heavy. Although a pessimistic, intensely dark mood pervades just about all the band's music, they balance it with super-rock along the lines of mid-70s King Crimson and a love of extremities. Think prog as S&M; accessory, and you're in the ballpark. 10,000 Light Years, the band's 12th album, begins with the title track, and the group's modus operandi of all things loud, tricky and black doesn't appear to have changed much. The music isn't less complex than like-minded American bands like Don Caballero or Boud Deun, but it's infinitely more monstrous-- mostly due to Null's overdrive guitar and Steve Albini's ever-raucous mix tendencies. This tune leads to ""Implosion,"" featuring Null's horror-house, death-metal vocal stylings. Most people might dismiss this stuff as overly complicated Pantera-lite, especially if they aren't familiar with Null's more experimental work. Truthfully, I don't see a big difference between this and your workaday death metal act, but perhaps it's all part of the concept. ""Interzona 2"" (a revision of ""Interzona,"" from their Freedom Bondage album) makes some of the album's most effective use of dynamics, and not coincidentally makes the best case for this music being more than death metal. The riffs are all still there, and while the overall feeling of claustrophobic doom prevails, after close to 15 years of making records, the band knows how to channel their power. ""Last Nanosecond"" travels along similar routes, but adds a tad more dexterity to the mix, with ostinato basslines and muted guitar figures helping to bring the distant, inevitable frenzy to a boil. New drummer Masataka Fujikake gets heavy props here (and throughout the album) for being precise where a thud would've sufficed. And though thrash drum kingpins like Dave Lombardo and Mick Harris may be the archetypes for this style, he has the drill down. There are four more songs on this album. I'd love to tell you how they complimented the heavy metallic discourse already presented, but that would be misleading. See, my only complaint with albums like this is that they can tend to be a tad monolithic. Yes, all of the tunes rock and most of them even manage to keep the technical musician inside of me happy, listening to the manic, elephant-footed drumming and Null's riffs from hell. But these tracks all sound a little similar to my ears. While that works for some of his projects (the excellent New Kind of Water with O'Rourke being a prime example), it gets pretty mind-numbing here. Null has a history of changing directions and playing music you wouldn't have expected him to play, but for now, only those about to rock need apply.","K.K.

Ringworm Interiors,Circus Devils,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5dbea9e61561daa522b/1:1/w_160/a0e79364.jpg,2001-11-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1479-ringworm-interiors/,Rockathon,"As of June 29th, 2001, there were approximately 816,119 words in the English language. Assuming that, by that particular date, Robert Pollard had written about 6,000 songs, each one using approximately 10 words that didn't appear in other songs, that means that almost one tenth of all the words in the English language have appeared somewhere in a Bob Pollard song. Considering that a lot of musicians can't seem to get past the same two or three, this is a pretty big accomplishment. Not only does Pollard use a whole lot of words; he usually manages to use them in a way that most songwriters would never even think of. Some of the catchiest songs Pollard ever wrote are called ""Game of Pricks"" and ""Tractor Rape Chain""-- unquestionably the only times any of those words have been used in those particular orders. Sure, there have been a few moments of unabashed silliness (""Kicker of Elves""), and a few lapses into awful cliché (""Hold On Hope,"") but generally speaking, Pollard has managed to retain a uniquely skewed lyrical vision. Sadly, the same can't always be said about his music. At his best, Pollard seems to be driven by an almost inhumanly sincere passion to create great, timeless rock songs. When that sincerity shines through, the results are just fucking amazing. When it's corrupted even in the slightest by a wish to appeal to a specific audience, or to consciously stray from what Pollard is so very good at, the results generally suffer. Which brings us to Ringworm Interiors, the fifteenth album in Pollard's ""Fading Captain"" series, and Pollard's only album thus far with brothers Tim and Todd Tobias backing him. While Pollard sings on the album, co-writes its songs, and no doubt came up with the name of the band and the album, Todd Tobias seems to be the prominent musician here, playing most of the album's instruments and co-producing with John Shough. Unfortunately, it seems that the collaboration between Bob and Todd isn't nearly as fruitful as the Bob and Tobe collaborations that were released this year as Airport 5, or for that matter, the vast majority of Bob's work with Guided by Voices and as a solo artist. Todd Tobias is credited with ""instrumentation and noises"" on Ringworm Interiors, and that description certainly seems fitting. Aside from the usual setup of guitar, bass, and drums, the album is home to lots of strange, squeaky, and crunchy noises. Unfortunately, the urge to fuck around with effects pedals and tape delay never quite meshes with the hints of brilliant songwriting that appear throughout the record, resulting in an album with a few wonderful moments, but a general feeling of disarray. Songs like ""You First"" bring to mind Pollard's recent work with the Soft Rock Renegades. Wistful, pretty, and melancholy, Pollard lets loose a truly affecting melody with a wonderfully natural delivery. It's been said over and over again that he makes it look easy-- and even after years and years of songwriting, tracks like ""You First"" indicate that he's far from reaching a brick wall. ""Apparent the Red Angus"" takes this reflective whimsy a step further, opening with a brief vocal melody that's in many ways more similar to Stephen Sondheim than Pete Townshend. The song quickly develops into a more rocked out, multi-part epic of sorts before returning to its original melody for a brief, shining moment. Beautiful stuff, and definitely one of the best Pollard songs in recent memory. Elsewhere, Ringworm Interiors simply falls short. ""Feel Try Fury"" never really delivers on its arena rock promises, and the ""experimental"" snippets of dense fuzz and backwards guitar that are scattered all over the album accomplish absolutely nothing, other than distracting the listener from the fact that there are sometimes some really great songs underneath the layers of aimless experimentation. As has always been the case, Pollard remains at his best when there's no discernable, conscious effort to do anything other than write great songs. On Ringworm Interiors, there's ample proof that the songs are still in him. And considering that there are over 600,000 words that have yet to see inclusion in a Bob Pollard song, there's plenty of room to hope he'll find a better way to let them out.","As of June 29th, 2001, there were approximately 816,119 words in the English\n\ language.

Scary World Theory,Lali Puna,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7c13d197565213b32e/1:1/w_160/dee9e38a.jpg,2001-11-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4646-scary-world-theory/,Morr,"Radiohead's Colin Greenwood will be very happy. The Munich-based experimental pop band Lali Puna follow up Radiohead's favorite album, Tridecoder, with Scary World Theory. Greenwood has gone through at least four copies of Tridecoder. How many copies of Scary World Theory will he get through? Or will he spend his millions on keeping its restrained brilliance off the streets? After the dissolution of her previous band, L.B. Page, Lali Puna lynchpin Valérie Trebeljahr spent a lot of time avoiding human contact and fostering a profound connection with her four-track tape deck. Trebeljahr shared the results of her seclusion with the Notwist's Markus Acher, and soon, her Snooze EP was released to small but critical acclaim. Having contributed to the ""Hausmusik Reienhaus"" series and the Belgian K-raa-k label, Trebeljahr and Acher handpicked the crop of the German leftfield scene for additional bandmates. They came up with percussionist Christoph Brandner of the Notwist-affiliated Tied and Tickled Trio, and Florian Zimmer keyboardist of Iso 68 and Fred is Dead. Shortly after the release of Tridecoder, super-genius producer and Lone Swordsman Andrew Weatherall admitted that he listened to Lali Puna on a ceaseless loop and, as Scary World Theory undeniably points out, there was a very good reason for that. Valérie Trebeljahr's blank vocal style has diverted attention from the style of music Two Lone Swordsmen are so deeply immersed in. Journalists have distracted themselves by attempting to morph Trebeljahr into Laetitia Sadier and remain oblivious to the reason that Weatherall loves this band so much: Lali Puna's music is a flawless adaptation of the glitch electro funk of Two Lone Swordmen's Tiny Reminders. To hammer this point home, any meaningful distinction between the two bands broke down when Lali Puna ""remixed"" Two Lone Swordsmen's ""It's Not the Worst I've Ever Looked... Just the Most I've Ever Cared"" for the Swordsmen's Further Reminders remix LP. Scary World Theory handsomely discounts any accusations of plagiarism but isn't so deft at avoiding the lesser charge of imitation. The album starts with Sly Stone's fuzzy beat box limping out a rhythm before Trebeljahr's emotionless vocals utter the lyrics to ""Nin-com-pop"": ""There was no reason to complain/ It's all been candy cream/ Neatly, smooth and clean forever."" After each verse, a sparse guitar figure slinks in pursuit of prey while itself being stalked by an equally emaciated synth figure. Untroubled by these, Trebeljahr continues blankly on: ""Yet things happened just that way/ Realize your fate/ Shut it down, increase the pressure."" Out of the crackles of an Ovalprocessed piano, Trebeljahr chants slogans on two-thirds of ""Middle Curse."" From a distance, she hectors listeners to quit their jobs, not to cross their fingers, to slam their doors and not look back. The bass twirls about the whiplashing snares, the snuffed hi-hats giving the impression that the Neptunes had a hand in the production. Arthur Baker's signature NYC art-disco-punk handclap solo opens ""Bi-Pet"" as Trebeljahr warms up her Laurie Anderson-on-Haldol vocals. ""Born/ Bought/ Discouraged/ All the things we do are pin-up sweet/ In between we're recorders/ In between we try."" After several passes over these disconsolate lyrics, Trebeljahr allows the machines to parade their skeletal elegance, only to be called away from the catwalk just as a definite groove gets going. The Cure-meets-Tortoise instrumental ""Contratempo"" acts as a spry bridge between the passive resignation of ""Bi-Pet"" and the Spartan sumptuousness of the title track. In a dimension less occupied with Britney and Harry Potter, Scary World Theory has won an Ivor Novello award and has been featured in a Baz Luhrmann revisionist musical melodrama. All the passion Trebeljahr has pent up during her previous performances she now releases in an intense Kahimi Karie hush: ""I've never said you'll have to be afraid/ Of the cookie monster/ Beside your bed."" The band compliment Trebeljahr's enthusiasm by filling out the sound space with warbling organs and staccato guitar lines familiar to anyone who's fallen in love with the Notwist's Shrink. ""50 Faces Of"" shows off the band's competence at leftfield dance music only to be out slammed by ""Lowdown,"" a jaw-dropping adaptation of New Order's ""Dream Attack."" ""Don't Think"" returns Trebeljahr to the Ovalprocess lab and to the blank vocal delivery that mimics the desperation of the lyrics, ""Can't think/ As I'm answering your questions/ But you won't listen anyway/ I could be mute."" ""Come On Home"" closes the album in a menacing electro swirl similar to Andrea Parker's Dark Ages EP. Things get truly disturbing as Trebeljahr sings, ""The man on the plasticbag looks like terror/ He's staring at me/ I can't see why/ His face seems spoiled."" What Isaac Babel said about writing could easily be applied to the sinewy austerity of Scary World Theory: ""Your language becomes clear and strong not when you can no longer add but when you can no longer take away."" Unless he's overcome with jealousy, Colin Greenwood is going to be mightily overjoyed with this release.","Radiohead's Colin Greenwood will be very happy.

Three Henries,Pillow,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06f9d034d5c69bf26fb/1:1/w_160/ac0712e1.gif,2001-11-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6289-three-henries/,Häpna,"Chicago has become something of a target of late. Critics everywhere stand poised and alert, eager to be the one that drives the first nails into the coffin of a once-great music scene. They say they've grown tired of this ""post-rock"" nonsense-- the hybrid of Louisville-style rock, Chicago/AACM-style jazz, unusual instrumentation, and heavy experimental leanings that the city has prided itself on for the past ten years. The term itself a confused and failed attempt to ground a genre whose only constant is change. They claim that Chicago has gone stagnant, and grown too comfortable and reliant on the same formula of lazy-but-upbeat songs, pointing to a market overstuffed with TNT rip-offs where once there had been such variety. And all this was before Jim O'Rourke-- once a lynchpin of Windy City musical circles-- went east, accepted a full-fledged membership in Sonic Youth, and started ranting to glossy-paged hipster music magazines abut the death of creative music in Chicago. The fact is, if post-rock was all Chicago has to offer, I'd be right in line with the other naysayers. After Scott Herren's dead-on imitation of the genre (under the name Savath and Savalas), it's hard to argue that the sound hasn't grown a bit stale. But the city by the lake is one whose music is as diverse as is its people. Contrary to popular belief, there is far more to the Chicago sound than Tortoise imposters and math-rock. Even so, the critics wait, saliva hanging from their loosed jowls, and Diamond Jim dons his finest bunny suit for photo shoots on Brooklyn rooftops. Yet, despite its many detractors, the Chicago scene is holding its own, preparing for an attack against supposed monotony, and allowing new leaders to step into the limelight, to grow and develop at their own pace. In Chicago's war against boring music, Fred Lonberg-Holm stands on the front lines, armed with nothing but a bow, an ordinary cello and a bag of tricks to put the best of clowns to shame. Every bit as likely to contribute lush accompaniment for Freakwater as he is to play squealing noise (Lonberg-Holm did time in Weasel Walter's constantly evolving free-jazz/metal/noise/performance ensemble the Flying Luttenbachers) or to stretch the limits of avant-improvisation (take, for example, a duet this summer wherein Lonberg-Holm jammed action figures in between his strings and struck them with a modified electric toothbrush, while Michael Zerang placed cymbals atop a snare and bashed them with a vibrating dildo), there's no accusing Lonberg-Holm of solidarity. This is a man who's played with everyone. On Three Henries, ""everyone"" is narrowed down to Ben Vida and Liz Payne-- one-half of the sleepy post-rock/jazz group Town and Country-- and reedist and fellow-former-Luttenbacher Michael Corrigan. It's an interesting grouping; two artists from one of the quietest groups in town making music with two compatriots of Weasel Walter. Yet, it works; the musicians are well aware of their diverse musical lineage, and, like an interracial couple who make public their love despite the screams and objections of their inherently racist families, Pillow stands unafraid to flaunt them. It's this very willingness to experiment that leads me to maintain that Chicago is still a more alive and exciting place to make music than most. For those whose exposure to Chicago music ends with the closing notes of Standards, the sounds contained on Three Henries might be surprising. The album begins with what sounds like a distant alarm clock (I can only assume this is the dry ice and tubes Corrigan is credited with playing, though really, who knows?) and a random pluck of a guitar. Corrigan jumps in with sparse toots arranged in Spiritual-era Art Ensemble style, while Lonberg-Holm alternates between long strokes and seemingly random plucks. Ben Vida's guitar lays a background-- his playing reminiscent of the slow-building style of Brise-Glace, the musical equivalent of treading water-- while Liz Payne's bass lingers in the corner, barely audible. As the movement progresses, these dynamics shift, one overtaking the other, dynamics shifting like mad, every instrument battling all the others for the listener's ear. Surprising to some, yes. But for those of us every bit as familiar with Jeff Parker and Co.'s frequent jazz outings, this is nothing too unusual. The eight improvisations recorded here, all untitled, juggle each player's idiosyncrasies well. It is at times slow-moving and dreamy like a Town and Country record, and at others unforgivingly discordant and jarring like so much of Lonberg-Holm's other work. Vida plays guitar and accordion. Lonberg-Holm switches off, at points, to something called the nyckelharpa. Slow moving, yet interlocking with undeniable precision, Pillow comes off as a Chicago-based tribute to John Zorn's Naked City. It's an intriguing prospect, and one that's hit or miss. For every moment that excites, there's one that lulls. This is the nature of the improvisation-- some parts will naturally be more interesting than others-- but Three Henries is improvisation properly executed; the slow parts serving only make us appreciate the exciting parts even more. Even though Pillow's Three Henries may not be the saving grace that sets Chicago back on track, it stands as a fine reminder that the city is unlikely to go down with out a fight. It seems everyone in Chicago has played with everyone else at least once, and still the vast majority of players here-- all members of Pillow included-- maintain a remarkably intuitive grasp on their fellow musicians' explorations. This makes for interesting music, where even the less inspired moments are still worthy of a close listen. Is Three Henries likely to start another underground movement as did Tortoise's TNT? Naaaah. But it will intrigue those with an open ear, and excite those who know deep in their hearts that there's more to the Windy City than post-schlock.","Chicago has become something of a target of late.

62-56,Electric Company,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc33abf31b7dc7155c7a/1:1/w_160/b788f8fc.gif,2001-11-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2730-62-56/,Tigerbeat6,"I only see one photograph of Electric Company's Brad Laner in circulation, a black and white shot that looks like it was taken in a closet. In this photo, Laner's wearing sunglasses as he sits surrounded by equipment in the poorly lit room, looking like a serious fellow committed to his art who just might have a vitamin D deficiency. It's just a stupid press shot, but I can't help but think of it when I listen to 62-56. Both the photograph and this album seem to lack life. A very wise man with 18-inch biceps once observed that you can't start a fire without a spark, and he just might have been imagining music like 62-56 as he gazed into the eyes of a teenaged Courtney Cox. Through its 45-minute length, this record smolders away in the CD tray, a few deep breaths and a bundle of kindling from ignition. I should note that this is by no means a bad record. Laner's skilled with his laptop software, and he knows how to wring a battery of interesting sounds from his synth modules. But only a small handful of tracks grab the listener in any real way. Mostly they just motor by like an elaborate float in a Mardi Gras parade, admired in passing but never remembered. There are worthwhile moments. The first winner is ""Hyperion."" It's Electric Company's only stab at the pop song, a bit of DSP reggae cut with silly squeals and buzzes. As well as being the most rhythmically engaging track here by far, it's also the only one to show a sense of humor, something that works well in the context of heavily processed electronic music (ask an artist on Sonig). I also have to give Electric Company credit for skillful editing, as the songs here flow one into another in a way that makes sense. Particularly striking is ""Siamang"" into ""Test Card."" The former features a particularly pretty four-note keyboard melody in the Aphex style, and as the track segues into ""Test Card"" an organic, dubby bassline is brought forward, accented with spare hits of feedback. Those three tracks are front-loaded in the first half of the record, and the b-side is where this thing falters. ""Simi Valley Radar"" is interesting enough, evoking the electronic swamp vibe of Eno's On Land, but the final five tracks go nowhere, as Laner seems content to merely string one squiggly sound to another, giving little thought to composition or arrangement. The minute-long ""New Hearing A"" is crammed with a dozen variations on a Reaktor patch probably called ""Crunchy,"" and ""New Hearing B"" cuts and pastes a few from one that might be called ""Crackly"" on top. 62-56 is not completely devoid of interest, but too much of it comes across as passable, generic IDM.","I only see one photograph of Electric Company's Brad Laner in circulation, a black and white shot that looks ...

Not familiar with Duluthian etiquette? Here are some guidelines you should get acquainted with before you get all elitist on your friends and/or subordinates: 1. Do not pigeonhole. In referring to Low, refrain from the use of the following words or phrases: ""slowcore,"" ""slo-fi,"" ""snorecore,"" etc. Low doesn't center around being slow, and they don't intentionally perform low-tempo songs in order to be ""different."" Well, not anymore, anyway, seeing as they've sheepishly admitted that they used to tailor songs to the standard slow-and-quiet rubric. These days, they write moving songs with minimalist tendencies. You can use that one on your comrades. And when they respond with a rebuttal on how amazing Incubus' songwriting is, tell them that Brandon Boyd's navel really isn't all that attractive. Usually gets them going. 2. If you ever happen to be around members of the band, do not under any circumstances mention the owL remix Low album. While it's okay to enjoy their somber rendition of ""Little Drummer Boy"" on a Gap commercial, it's just weird to hear them while you're actually in the store. Or perhaps you should just avoid the store altogether. 3. Low shows are not the place to be rowdy. That means no yelling, clapping at inappropriate times, or singing along obnoxiously. While it's standard rock and roll fare to aurally show your appreciation for a band and prove that you are the biggest fan in the room, Low concerts are closer to a performance of the Marriage of Figaro than a performance by Kiss, in that, if you're not completely silent, you might just miss something. Which is a piece of advice that should be dispensed at the door of all Low concerts. At least, I wish that it were when listening to Anthony, Are You Around?, recorded in November 1999 at La Maroquinerie in Paris and released only in Japan on P-Vine. Deemed ""a small victory"" by Alan Sparhawk, the concert documented is the first to take place in ""a proper music venue."" As such, there are points during the recording when I cringe at the sound of rabid fans acknowledging a song that they recognize (""Starfire,"" ""Immune"") or cheering at the prospect of a guitar solo (""Blue Christmas""). While these arrangements fundamentally remain faithful to their studio counterparts (except for the loss of strings and keyboards), a majority of the tracks are imbued with a sense of energy only possible with a live performance in front of an audience. ""Rope"" and ""Soon"" are prime testaments, both leaning towards sprawling and epic (to the extent that Low can be epic). ""Soon,"" a contender for best track present, ditches the strings, replacing them a sense of dynamic exemplified by the extended bridge. Mimi Parker's crash echoes the desperation built by Alan Sparhawk and Zak Sally (on guitar and bass, respectively) before falling back to near-silence as Sparhawk, at his most intense, delivers the truncated final verse in a broken voice. Most of the setlist is comprised of Secret Name tracks, with some especially delectable oldies and singles thrown in, which the band rarely performs: ""Rope,"" ""Lazy,"" ""Joan of Arc,"" and ""No Need"" are all present. And while there's a request for ""Sunshine,"" it goes ignored. ""Hey Chicago"" from the stunning Songs for a Dead Pilot EP feels short, yet is extremely satisfying despite the absence of Chris Freeman's pervasive keyboards. Sparhawk introduces ""Blue Christmas"" by saying, ""We're going to do a song originally done by the King."" Parker's vocals stray from Elvis' heavy vibrato, laying bare a simple holiday sentiment. The aforementioned guitar solo during the song, which was later included on the lauded Christmas EP, reiterates the simple maudlin melody, adding a slight tremolo. This recording is sourced from the board, so it's of quality even with some noise, but as Alan states in the liner notes, the vocals are a bit high. It's also apparent in the recording that the venue is quite small, since you can hear the audience so clearly when they yell. As for garnering more fans, this release is only available domestically on import from Japan, so I'm sure newcomers will consider the $30 price tag a bit steep. This recording, however, does epitomize Low, but even without the difference in price, I would direct first-timers to Things We Lost in the Fire or The Curtain Hits the Cast.","Just getting into Low?

Relative Ways EP,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a093c0084474cd0bfbea/1:1/w_160/3c225a89.gif,2001-11-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/180-relative-ways-ep/,Interscope,"I feel sorry for bands who have to compete with critics' unrealized expectations. We saw what Rome (Written Upside Down) did for Les Savy Fav's Go Forth and we're not happy. What would have otherwise been a rather fulfilling full-length seemed to lack the innovation that was promised by the group's tour-de-force EP. I certainly don't want to sentence And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead to this fate-- expectations easily get out of hand and can quickly become insurmountable-- but it appears that they've brought it on themselves. Why else would they release this seemingly innocuous collection of scrawling post-punk? The band's newly honed songwriting skills become immediately apparent on the disc's first track, ""Relative Ways."" Yes, the Trail of Dead are still having a great time attempting to recreate the Daydream Nation experience, but here, they're finally pulling it off with enough intensity to convince you that the sound still has some uncharted ground to be covered. That having been said, the new EP expands their once-limited musical vocabulary to convey such previously foreign topics as happiness and sanguinity. And the lyrics, though still predominantly angstful, have matured to the point of potency and quotability. Here's a slice for you: ""It's okay, I'm a saint/ I forgave your mistakes."" Nevermind that Kevin Allen's voice sounds more like Thurston Moore than ever. All too often, artists evolve sonically while choosing to jettison the most effective nuances of their music. While I believe it's necessary for artists to self-actualize, it should be noted that they tend to alienate much of their fanbase in the process. So, there's something to be said for groups whose initial approach to writing consistently yields profound results. Such is the case with ""Blood Rites,"" the EP's obligatory reflection on the essential formula of the Trail's previous outings. The recent popularity of such decidedly pubescent groups as Slipknot and Papa Roach has made it harder for songs of this genre to yield outstanding moments, but the Trail of Dead manage to walk on thin ice without slipping, leaving us with the same self-effacing freshness of Madonna (the album). This disc marks the first appearance of material written under the wing of Interscope Records. The production values are up and the sound has lost a bit of the intimacy that was once an integral part of the group's records. Of course, this all seems trivial when compared with the leaps made in style and ability. Even the primarily ambient ""Blade Runner,"" which closes the record, is pulled off with a formerly unseen grace. All told, it seems that the Trail have carved themselves a comfortable niche in which they can feel free to explore, subvert, and bastardize their influences into hideous four-minute gems. It's not easy to cut an ""essential"" EP and, despite the quality of the material and the consumer-friendly price, this isn't Rome (Written Upside Down), the Archers of Loaf's Vs. the Greatest of All Time, or Mogwai's EP+2. Each of those releases set a precedent by which the rest of their respective artists' careers would be judged. And while Relative Ways is a departure for the Trail of Dead, it certainly doesn't mark a radical change in the band's aesthetic. Of course, when judged on its own terms, Relative Ways is well worth its price tag and, most importantly, hints at what could be achieved if And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead keep the focus that appears to have inspired these songs.","I feel sorry for bands who have to compete with critics' unrealized expectations.

Sings Reign Rebuilder,Set Fire to Flames,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a8b1335d7bf1698798/1:1/w_160/8852c1f5.jpg,2001-11-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7076-sings-reign-rebuilder/,Alien8,"""What they create is illusions of niceness and kindness-- it's all rottenness; all bad things, like we were taught years ago. I'm a firm believer in you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. At a very young age I understood what life was all about, and I was only a kid. I have very much knowledge of what's going on in this world, and it's cruel-- it's inhumane.""
-- Lyingdyingwonderbody #3 Signs of decadence in the Western world are prevalent in American culture, even our beloved ""counterculture"" of independent music. Our song lyrics give us away. Consider, for example, the entire self-absorbed sub-genre of ""emo,"" or the pathetic self-loathing of icons like Radiohead. Whatever their general subject matter, the subject is generally the same: it's all about ""me."" If history tells us anything, it's that a decadent society doesn't last long. Something tells me that Set Fire to Flames agrees, and has a bead on the fall of the empire. Part of it derives from their association with the same Canadian collective that produced Godspeed You Black Emperor! and Silver Mt. Zion (some of you might recognize surname-free individuals like Aidan, Beckie and Sophie). The other part has to do with the royally fucked-up liner notes and madmen vignettes from Set Fire to Flame's debut LP, Sings Reign Rebuilder. The 13 member instrumental group uses the rants of three numbered madmen-- Lyingdyingwonderbody one, two and three-- to haunt its already intense and hypnotic instrumental drones. When the last (#3) finishes his above-cited rant, Set Fire to Flames loops the phrase ""what's going on,"" a question that applies as aptly to our culture as to Sings Reign Rebuilder. The album is brilliant, and arises from an incredible concept. Someone in Set Fire to Flames was apparently not convinced that they were despondent enough, so part of the project-- the whole project, really-- centered around isolation. All thirteen members, in addition to sound engineers, techs, etc., piled into a decrepit two-story apartment in Montreal and remained there, uninterrupted, for five days. According to the band, the idea was to push ""tolerance levels and limitations"" to see ""what would actually happen if [they] attempted to record improvised drones under those conditions-- and what impact it might have on [their] heads."" It took them five days to reach a fine delirium; it took me about three. Once it settles in, Sings Reign Rebuilder is a gripping testament to the power of emotional expression in music. About half of the recording is improvised, made up largely of improvised percussion (scratching guitar strings, tapping on microphones) and incidental noise (creaking floors, foot traffic, police cars). The length of the drones is daunting, but after you acclimate to the idea that they're not reaching for the same full-bore crescendos as GYBE!, et al, it draws you in. The band gets right down to business on ""Vienna Arcweld,"" musing over percussion and noise for about ten minutes, before a drum kit gives the track some shape. The raw texture apparent on ""Vienna"" binds the entire album-- both the improvised and composed pieces. On ""Omaha,"" the dominant motif broods in and out of dissonance for the first few minutes, with drums deep in the background playing almost independently of the rhythm. By the end, the drums and the melody have joined, with the former gaining strength until they reach an almost tribal intensity-- restrained, yet ardent and passionate. Even the most closely composed piece, ""There is No Dance in Frequency and Balance,"" has a gritty texture that blends magically with the rest of the album. The dark, dirty, Tortoise-style funk is stylistically unique on the disc, but contrasted with all of the nebulous improvisation and downcast melancholy, it's like an oasis in the desert. The band sees the finest fruits of the isolation-concept on ""Shit-heap: Gloria of the New Town Planning,"" the ultimate in slow-building tension. It has all of the elements; ambient percussion, tiny rhythmic modulations, the subtle increase in tempo, each adding to a bitter intensity. The message to the rest of the world's avant-rockers and post-rockers is this: find yourself a good ideology, then lock yourself in a hole for a few days and make sure to bring your sound engineer (and don't forget to find a few psychos for some choice field recordings). Something about the extremes of experience added dramatically to the emotional output of Set Fire to Flames, and resulted in a marvelously inventive and powerful album.","""What they create is illusions of niceness and kindness-- it's all rottenness; all bad things, like we were taught ...

Blood,The Microphones,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46169fc7814a47cd888/1:1/w_160/9488068c.gif,2001-11-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5271-blood/,St. Ives,"I was a bit uncertain this summer when I went to see the Microphones. As I climbed the steps to the Wicker Park art studio where the band was to perform, I couldn't help but wonder how the multi-layered grandiose of songs like ""Between Your Ear and the Other Ear"" could possibly translate live. Confounding things even more was the knowledge that the Microphones isn't really a band at all, but the result of experiments conducted by Phil Elvrum, one man with a uniquely twisted take on songwriting and recording. But no amount of uncertainty could have prepared for what occurred that night. Dubbed a ""paper opera,"" the evening's performance was, for better or worse, unlike any other I'd ever attended. Among the highlights: Sometimes-Microphones vocalist Khaela Maricich prancing about the studio, strumming a ukulele, singing, and brandishing mildly seductive gazes as weapons against the stone-cool exteriors of grim-faced indie-boys, slowly coaxing them out of their collapsible metal seats and into the aisles. Calvin Johnson playing the role of MC, dancing hypnotically, occasionally picking up his acoustic guitar or signing, and generally standing guard over his young talent like some sort of father figure. Elvrum, usually hiding behind a fort made of newspapers and cheap fabrics, sometimes emerging to make up songs on the spot, often while donning an oversized cartoon wolf's head, chasing Maricich around the room, stealing audience members' sodas, and referring to himself only as ""Big Bad Death."" Not a single instrument was amplified. Not one song off a single Microphones album was sung. There was no proper order of acts; the musicians jumped in and out of one another's sets at will. The performance left two strong impressions in my mind. One was a strong understanding of the ideals behind Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios, which favors community and fooling around over so-called proper musicianship. The other? The elimination of any doubt in my mind that Phil Elvrum is one fucking strange individual. Of course, I intend this as the highest of compliments. Without his mind for the absurd or his goofball sensibilities, the Microphones would be just another in a long line of indistinguishable lo-fi bedroom-pop acts. It's Elvrum's ingenuity that found last year's It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water a place at the top of so many critics' lists and so close to the hearts of countless listeners. An oddity in itself, Blood is a super-limited collection released by a new vinyl-only imprint called St. Ives, which was opened by Secretly Canadian to give established artists an outlet for some of their more experimental projects. Only 300 copies of this record were released, each featuring different hand-painted covers. Musically, Blood is like a collection of b-sides to singles that never existed. Side One is stranger than most Microphones albums (if such a thing is imaginable) with constantly contrasting recording styles-- it's equal parts sound collage, demo-collection and noise. There's no tracklist to accompany the album, so I attempted my own. 1. An arrangement of horns plays a simple melody. Recording is crisp as can be. The ear can discern every individual horn. 2. Cheap recording of man talking about painful urination. Lots of static and background noise. 3. Droning organ harmonizes with voices. All sound drops out. Solo voice sings a cappella, though one gets the feeling that the sound of a silent summer night behind him or the all-encompassing hiss of the tape recording might be more important than the song in question. 4. Sound collage. Bits of guitar, droning vocals, shrieking, gongs, heavily amplified bass guitar, lots of feedback. 5. High-pitched voices hum a simple tune in harmony. 6. Heavy, but melodic feedback looped through delay pedals. 7. Very lo-fi demo recording; vocal, piano and acoustic guitar. One can barely make out the vocals. 8. See no. 6. 9. Like the vocal exercises that proceed a choir practices. Four notes, in progression, an ascending melody sung over and over again by an army of voices, each of which drop in and out at random. At one point, a piano plays a descending melody in the background. 10. Field recording: birds. 11. Multiple tapes of people talking, all running at once. 12. A quick, ska-flavored song, with adorable female vocals and multiple horns against a backdrop of organ and drums. ""If you were a mountaintop/ I'd keep ascending/ Never stop/ If you were some kind of store/ I'd buy you out/ And wait for more."" Probably the album's finest moment. My personal favorite at least. 13. More sound collage, acoustic guitars, organs, and feedback cut-up and pasted together. Neat. 14. Begins as a horn interlude. At some point, acoustic guitars join in and calming tones give way to distinct melody that builds and builds. 15. A cappella demo of The Glow, Pt. 2's ""Map."" Nasty recording, apparently done outdoors. At times, the sound of rustling wind overtakes the vocals. 16. Voices and wind cut out completely, but the dark, heavy-handed piano and tightly kept drum-march that end ""Map"" continue. The recording quality is now superb. As per the original, sonic noise bleeds in from the side. Eventually, it becomes the only thing you can hear. Taken as a whole, Blood's first side is every bit as engaging as the Microphone's more proper recordings. Its eclecticism works to its advantage, creating a thoroughly fascinating sonic journey through Elvrum's gleefully twisted mind. Unfortunately, Side Two is far less interesting, comprised mostly of lo-fi demos of ""The Mansion,"" ""I Felt My Size,"" ""The Gleam, Pt. 2,"" and ""Samurai Sword."" Though the songs stand up in acoustic form, they fail to hold a candle to the complete versions on The Glow, Pt. 2. Placed one after another, they come across as frivolous and somewhat unnecessary. Still, Blood closes on a strong point, with a lo-fi impromptu cover of Björk's ""All Is Full of Love,"" spliced with a hi-fi recording of Elvrum at the drums, followed by strings and percussion that escalates into the now-trademark Microphones wash of noise. The unnecessary string of demos and the small pressing will likely garner Blood non-essential status in the minds of many. Too bad, because most of the album sees Elvrum indulging his inner weirdo even more than usual. The result is his most eclectic recording yet, one which, at its best moments, absolutely stands up to the ""real"" Microphones albums. More importantly, it stands as a testament to the relaxed nature of the musical process curated by Calvin Johnson and utilized by Elvrum-- one which prioritizes having fun and nourishing the creative instinct, with the music itself almost an afterthought. It's a reminder of an idyllic, nondescript time in music history when rules didn't exist, recording was a forbidden word, music was made for music's sake, and no one had to be reminded of the energy that could come from such freedom.","I was a bit uncertain this summer when I went to see the Microphones.

Levitate,Idaho,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16213d19756521385ff/1:1/w_160/2c1ce8e6.jpg,2001-11-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4057-levitate/,Idaho Music,"The American Revolution, as we all learned in fourth grade, was rooted in the notion of personal liberty; self-determination, the triumph of freedom, and most of all, independence from tyrants. The American Patriots loved liberty so much that they were willing to risk their lives to free themselves from the despotic grip of the British monarchy. So, with the help of French people, the Patriots took it upon themselves to beat some ass, after which everything was better. God bless America. As the sole member of Idaho, Martin's love of independence mirrors that of our noble forefathers. Give Martin liberty or give him death-- just take a look at the liner notes for Idaho's sixth and latest LP, Levitate: ""Produced by Jeff Martin. All instruments by Jeff Martin. All songs by Jeff Martin."" The bastard even ""reserves all of his rights"" (oh wait... does everyone do that?). As if he weren't already overburdened with the writing, the production, the performing, and the rights-reserving, Martin's music bears his own imprint, Idaho Music. It's easy to be cynical of self-reliant rock stars. Often they're assholes, like Billy Corgan or Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, who fired his whole band via letter. Others we regard as perhaps a little abnormal; Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, for example, whose idea of creativity escapes all but the most intoxicated. But, having owned a few Idaho albums and seen them in concert, I feel that Jeff Martin's reasons for independence differ from those of his self-reliant peers. The biggest reason may be simply that Martin really is more talented than anyone he knows. Besides for his obvious ability as an instrumentalist (Martin is a classically trained pianist and wields a four-string guitar), what's most striking about Levitate is the production quality; like last year's Hearts of Palm, the precise, stripped-down approach on Levitate is remarkably effective at communicating emotions of longing, loneliness and distance. It tends towards a more organic sound than Hearts of Palm; the piano remains mostly acoustic, and figures prominently on almost every song. But Levitate keeps the innovative guitar, vocal and piano effects and manipulations that lent a profound haunting quality to Idaho's prior releases. ""On the Shore,"" for example, includes a lightly played acoustic piano joined by Martin's lazy, gentle vocals, and simple percussion that almost mimics rainfall. Distorted guitar feedback brings the composition to a halt, leading into ""Levitate Pt. 2,"" a preview to the plainly beautiful piano theme of the album's title track and finale. ""Santa Claus is Weird"" takes the emotion of distance literally; it sounds as if the drum kit is being played on the opposite side of a warehouse. You also have little moments like the wispy, spectral voices in the break between verses on ""20 Years"" (one of three rock numbers on the disc) that tell you Martin is paying attention to detail. Levitate isn't all roses for Martin, though. His lyrics occasionally leave something to be desired, as on ""Casa Mia."" Like much of the rest of the album, the orchestration of the song effectively communicates loss and regret, but Martin then over-enunciates awkward words like ""bougainvillea"" (as in the plant) and ""hollow point"" (as in the bullet), both of which stand out as contrived. Hardcore ""lyrics people"" may have difficulties with this and a few other tracks. In addition, the songwriting on Levitate isn't quite as compelling as prior releases-- it tempers some of Martin's passion and intensity, and in doing so, loses a bit of its edge. It's easy for sad-rockers to sound melancholy, but it's hard to do it with as much elegance as Jeff Martin. Levitate is not Idaho's best release (see Three Sheets to the Wind or Hearts of Palm), but it is one of their most coherent and complete, palatable from start to finish. Kudos to Jeff Martin for creating another fine album on his own, embodying our forefathers' ideals of independence and personal liberty, and most importantly, for doing it without the aid of the French.","The American Revolution, as we all learned in fourth grade, was rooted in the notion of personal liberty; self-determination, the ...

The Faces All Look On,Boxstep,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36fc0084474cd0c0286/1:1/w_160/5a9a2b15.jpg,2001-11-11 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/894-the-faces-all-look-on/,OvercoatOvercoat,"I can't dance. I'll readily admit it. Pretty much my only moves involve jerking my arms robotically and twitching my head back and forth. Usually, the dance I'll do at shows is something I call the indie: basically, you stand still with your arms crossed in front of your torso, and nod with mild interest. As far as slow dancing at social events is concerned, my girlfriend and I are lucky if we make a full rotation over the course of an entire song. Needless to say, group dance fads like the electric slide and the macarena are completely beyond me. There was a time when this was true of fewer people. Back in the 50s, just about everyone knew the twist, and before the rock 'n' roll era you had the Charleston, the foxtrot, and various other steps that most socially apt people could at least convincingly fake. From what I can gather, the boxstep is fairly similar to these other dances, in that it allows a certain amount of interpretation of a few basic moves. You and your partner essentially place your hands strategically (one on the shoulder, one in the other person's hand) and move back and forth, side to side, forming roughly a box-shape on the floor. I guess I could see doing a dance like that to some of the music Boxstep makes. The Pittsburgh septet splits their work pretty evenly between waltzes and traditional rock feels, and usually keeps the tempos toward the middle of the metronome scale, which, by definition, should offer some prime dancing conditions for dancehall traditionalists. ""Ryan's Glacier"" opens The Faces All Look On with a pretty passage showcasing Erin Hutter's light touch on the violin and lead guitarist David Wallace's country-influenced slide guitar, which proves to be one of the band's chief assets over the course of the album. Primary vocalist Eric Graf enters next with what appears to be a vague depiction of the Ice Age. ""The Appalachians were the first to go,"" he deadpans as guest Jackie Dempsey's accordion eases its way into the arrangement. The highlight of the song comes after about four minutes, when Wallace's guitar comes to the fore for a brief solo. David Wallace (not to be confused with David Foster Wallace) has a commanding guitar tone and an impeccable sense of phrasing that makes his playing the emotional lynchpin of Boxstep's sound. His surf-inflected sound on ""Airport Arrivals"" washes over the other instruments like a strong tide, pulling the other members to a frenzied coda that caps the song off brilliantly. Thankfully, the band puts him out front rather frequently, allowing his leads to guide the dynamics of most of the songs. Graf's rhythm guitar and Paul LaBrise's able piano comping usually free him up to do whatever he wants, too, and his responses to the vocal melodies are usually more interesting than the vocals themselves. Which brings me to my main complaint about Boxstep. The music is strong and the band's own production is perfect as far as the instruments are concerned. Unfortunately, Graf has a rather unremarkable voice-- his delivery is unrelentingly flat. Second vocalist Sarah Siplak is better, but she's invariably mixed lower, and never once takes the lead. The result of this imbalance is that the harmonies come across more as two people singing at the same time than they do as actual harmonies. Also, given that Siplak doesn't play any other instruments, it might make sense to give her a more prominent role in the band. Graf's vocal melodies are usually fairly average as well. For instance, on the excellent piano-driven waltz ""Irish Elk,"" he just seems to be singing without any sense of melodic contour, and he fails to deliver a convincing hook. On the contrary, Wallace delivers not one, but two absolutely sterling guitar solos, long on melodic content and devoid of wanky scale running. Similarly, Hutter's brief, understated violin solo in ""11:55"" totally eclipses the vocal melody. The album closes with ""Second Wedding Anniversary,"" an eight-minute song that wanders a bit too much to have the epic impact that it seems the band intended. Still, it manages to hold your attention for its duration, which is admirable in itself. Moreover, it exemplifies the band's strengths and weaknesses as well as any other track. The strings hover near the middle of the mix, adding color and character to the sound, while the rhythm section of bassist T.R. Daddario and drummer Greg Cislon provides a solid, understated foundation for it all to rest on. The vocals don't really offer anything memorable, though, and it's up to Wallace and his guitar to draw the listener in. A surprising acoustic guitar and accordion coda caps things off nicely. Boxstep are a good band, and The Faces All Look On is a debut that positively bursts with potential. Unfortunately, at this juncture, the moments of transcendence are offset by moments of boredom that come a little too frequently. With some work on their melodies and songcraft, Boxstep could become great. And maybe they could even make me want to dance.","I can't dance. I'll readily admit it.

Zeroone,Mia Doi Todd,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cc13d19756521394dc/1:1/w_160/a959d2a5.gif,2001-11-11 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8090-zeroone/,City Zen,"After landing on a handful of critics' year-end top ten lists with her 1997 debut, Come Out of Your Mine, and with just as many midsize record labels vying for her signature, Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Mia Doi Todd went and did a very brave thing-- some may call it very stupid. She decided to turn down all offers, formed her own label, and self-released her follow-up album. That album, Zeroone, the first release on City Zen Records, was released to significantly less fanfare than it would have received if it came out on, say, Sub Pop, which is too bad because it's at least as good as her debut, although not much of a progression. Harrowing, introspective, bare-bones voice and guitar, with emphasis on complex lyrical interplay, Zeroone is brimming with verbal puns and extended metaphors, all delivered with a voice that will stop you cold and send you running to either the repeat or stop button, depending what you look for in a vocalist. Imagine Tim Buckley meets Nico and you'll be in the ballpark of her sultry croons. Operatic, wavering, and ethereal, but also sullen and detached, Todd's voice is the first thing anyone approaching her music will notice. The second thing-- and the second potential obstacle-- is her lyrics. Yes, they're replete with literary complexity, but they're also sometimes full of literary preciousness. Some of her songs will surely come off as just a bit too cute, even pretentious, to some listeners-- even listeners like me who happen to like many of her songs. ""Digital"" is, unfortunately, Zeroone's lead-off track, and a good example of her over-wrought, over-refined, overly grad-school songcrafting. Hovering above her typical but adequate guitar accompaniment, Todd repeats such wordy insights as ""digital, binary system, ones and zeros, dark versus light, yin and yang,"" and so on and so on and so on. It just tries too hard to make some kind of, like, deep observation about life, man. I don't buy it. It sounds like the work of someone who just finished reading her first book on, say, entropic heat-death-- or maybe her first Thomas Pynchon novel-- and was inspired too try her hand at this whole po-mo gig. And don't even get me started on ""Ziggurat."" Its opening verse speaks for itself: ""Ziggurats are built only to crumble/ We approach the gods then prepare to tumble down."" Now I'll tolerate this kind of heavy-handed grandiosity in my heavy metal, or even in my hip-hop, but I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with it in acoustic balladry. But all is forgiven when a song like ""Can I?"" rolls around. Sounding much like something off Buckley's Lorca or Starsailor albums, to call it haunting would be an understatement. And simply quoting a line or two wouldn't even come close to conveying its power and mystery-- most of that comes from her delivery-- but suffice it to say she uses a refrain (""Can I?/ I think I can/ I can I think/ Think I can"") to weave a elaborate nexus connecting the various meanings within the song to stunning effect. Although the track is nearly ten minutes long and constructed simply from voice and guitar, I can't remember ever losing interest for a moment, even after multiple times through.

Been Here and Gone,Thalia Zedek,by: Andi Rowlands,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab41ea9e61561daa5d1c/1:1/w_160/567a5ff2.jpg,2001-11-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8945-been-here-and-gone/,Matador,"This record is New York. Not the same New York PJ Harvey wailed about on Stories from the City, or the one Sonic Youth addressed with NYC Ghosts & Flowers; one more akin to the lower east side after-hours retreats of Luna's Penthouse or Yo La Tengo's I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One. It's both quiet and loud in a way that invokes flickering lights against the city sky at dusk. Been Here and Gone isn't as much sad as it is tired. Maybe it was a long and busy day. The air might be getting colder. Maybe the seasons may have already changed. There's a light on in the kitchen and a window cracked in the bedroom. The Empire State Building rests on its side from the view on your pillow as you lay sleepless in the heat. Thalia Zedek's weathered voice reflects it all. A long way from her days spent with Come, Uzi, and Live Skull, Been Here and Gone seems the mature and reminiscent record of an aged career, like Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now or Neil Young's Harvest Moon. Supposedly inspired by the cabaret-style shows Come played between their third and fourth records, this album grew as a result of popular response to her stripped-down solo shows. On record, guitars, drums, piano, and violin play along, but may as well evaporate into the smoggy breeze, as the focal point at all times is Zedek's lulling voice. Echoes of Patti Smith, the Geraldine Fibbers' Carla Bozulich, and Mecca Normal's Jean Smith curl from her throat, stark and patient, as if she were singing indie rock's torch song. And maybe she is. Been Here and Gone sounds vintage but timeless, like an old photograph. And while neither groundbreaking nor post-whatever, Zedek captures moments like Kodak paper. Vaguely psychedelic instrumentation opens ""Excommunications (Everybody Knows),"" a Leonard Cohen-style dirge (its subtitle seems an homage to one of his best known songs) that trudges woefully along, until the effects fade, leaving the song to end stark and bare. ""Desanctified (Full Circle)"" works its charm with a see-sawing Dirty Three feel that's akin to green-faced sea-sickness. Here, though, this isn't a bad thing; the song shows its teeth where many of the album's other tracks hold but a solemn gaze. The record also features three piano-led songs, all of them covers. Two of these, Gary Gogel's ""1926"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Dance Me to the End of Love,"" work as a sort of center to the album, lightening the mood, and gradually bringing things closer until they're back in full view. The final track, Luiz Bonfa's ""Manha de Carnaval"" is consummate while simultaneously welcoming, bringing closure to the Been Here and Gone's long and insomnian New York night. It was best spent like this, anyway.","This record is New York. Not the same New York PJ Harvey wailed about on Stories from the City, or ...

Get There,Matt Marque,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b613d197565213bdbe/1:1/w_160/fdf8a532.jpg,2001-11-08 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5113-get-there/,Truckstop,"Well, this is a frustrating one. On the one hand, Matt Marque's debut album is a nicely crafted little package of songs, stuffed with fine musicianship from some of Chicago's finest scenesters, including five members and associates of the Boxhead Ensemble. He even got Brahms to play some piano for him. Well, it's not that Brahms-- this guy's name is Carl-- but he does a good job. But there's one thing offsetting all of this that I'm having a hard time getting past, and that's Matt Marque's voice. To his credit, no one else sounds quite like Marque on the mic. To his discredit, though, probably no one in the world really wants to. He warbles more tentatively than Mark Linkous, Jonathan Donahue, and Wayne Coyne combined, and as a result, listening to Get There is like watching a $7,000 Ming vase fall to the floor in slow motion: it's beautiful, it's fragile, and it's about to break. Marque seems as though he's slowly coming to terms with the fact that he's not really a singer. For one thing, many of the songs on his debut feature simple, easy-to-sing melodies that don't require a whole lot of range. And, blessedly, he's backed by Joe Ferguson (who's pulled duty doing everything from engineering the Promise Ring to playing all kinds of instruments for Simon Joyner, Sam Rivers and dozens of others) on several tracks. Ferguson, by himself, is not a hugely distinctive vocalist, but in the backing role he's given here, he adds a lot of spine to melodies that might otherwise collapse, borne on the back of a voice that's just not strong enough. The dual vocals have roughly the same effect as Isaac Brock double-tracking himself on some of Modest Mouse's quietest material-- it's shaky but it does the trick. And once you get past the frontman, you come across some richly detailed backing tracks, full of Fred Lonberg-Holm's humming cello, Steve Dorocke's muted pedal steel lines, and the stately drumming of Wilco's Glenn Kotche. Indeed, there's an incredible amount of skilled instrumental interplay going on here, and it's a shame it's not supporting something stronger. Marque himself isn't a bad guitarist by any measure, and when he and Boxhead Ensemble ringleader Michael Krassner duel on their acoustics, it provides for some of the album's most enjoyable moments. The instrumental, ""Here Is What I've Been Trying to Tell You,"" brings this interplay to the fore over Adam Morganstern's programmed beat, providing a pleasant interlude and a needed respite from Marque's grating lead vocals. Other musical highlights include ""Collage Made of Air,"" which takes the white-boy soul/funk that Lambchop so often ply as their blueprint, resulting in a breezy number with enough kick in its step to overcome the poorly delineated melody riding on top of it. The sublime and the irritating do battle a number of times elsewhere, too. It's a weird juxtaposition to listen to Lonberg-Holm's rich, beautiful cello buzzing in the background of ""Windshield,"" contrasted against Marque trying to pick a fight with a melody five times his size. Unfortunately, Marque's shortcomings as a performer get the best of him more often than not, and Get There suffers accordingly. At barely a half-hour long, his debut offers a sketch of a talent that's still in the making-- one that might be best off offering his words to another singer. Matt Marque has certainly surrounded himself with the right people to make an excellent record; perhaps next time he'll be able to iron out his personal wrinkles enough to carry his music to its fullest realization.","Well, this is a frustrating one.

Tango n' Vectif,µ-Ziq,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c013d197565213971a/1:1/w_160/1435ffb4.gif,2001-11-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8321-tango-n-vectif/,RephlexRephlex,"In 1993, before the IDM phenomenon had drawn enough recognition to merit so much as a name, David Toop penned an exposé for The Times on the surge of Britain's up-and-coming ""bedroom composers."" The photographs that ran with the article showed a slight young man with a prominent Adam's apple, gym-teacher glasses and a gnarled ponytail, and the pubescent shadow of a moustache spreading over his upper lip. Dressed plainly in a sweatshirt sporting the name of his former band, he tapped at the ivories of his Casio FZ-1 keyboard amid the clutter of his mother's house. Some laughed when Toop said the future of music rested in this man's spindly, awkward hands. But Mike Paradinas, for it was he, laughed last. In the eight years since that article ran, Paradinas has emerged as one of the most influential magnates of the avant-electronic scene. He's now a married father of one, living in his own home and managing a first-rate record label that he started from scratch. The moustache is gone, along with the ponytail (sold for roughly $80 on eBay)-- and with them, any question of whether Mike lived up to Mr. Toop's monumental charge. Operating under a total of seven pseudonyms (omitting collaborations), Paradinas has guided the growth of electronic music with genius and grace. And few works showcase his talent more ably than 1993's Tango n' Vectif. Paradinas' second release, after an impossibly rare 12"" issued under the Diesel M moniker, Tango paints in sweeping, creative strokes, unrestrained by the genre-based trappings that often limit contemporary IDM. A few weeks ago, Richard D. James' Rephlex label reissued this gem, compiling several unreleased tracks with material from the original CD and vinyl releases, as well as the long-lost ""PHI*1700"" single. At two discs and 26 songs, this reissue retails at most online vendors for a few dollars less than the 13-track U.S. original. Nice. Most of the material on Tango n' Vectif was composed well before its release, and in places, the album betrays its age. The granular fidelity sounds unrefined, and straightforward instrumental arrangements like those of the ""Phragmal Synthesis"" suite have long since fallen out of favor with the ""intelligent"" crowd. But nitpicking aside, Tango is by all measures a truly staggering album. Consider that in 1993, Autechre released Incunabula, James issued Surfing on Sine Waves, the Joyrex 12-inches, and Analogue Bubblebath 3, and Beaumont Hannant drew critical acclaim for his Tastes and Textures series. Against Tango n' Vectif, even such notably progressive albums sound dated and one-dimensional. And in today's climate of vain experimentation, scrupulous precision and perfect sound, \xB5-Ziq's debut, in all its raw glory, continues to hold its own. It's hard to believe that a gangly young recluse with no musical training could imagine such bold, poignant textures from the confines of a bedroom. The self-titled opening track wastes no time in showing you where the album stands. A yawning bassline creeps out from the song's recesses, fastened down by punishing drums and jagged metallic clangs. Paradinas tempers the song's stark ambiance with simple, playful melodies, lending an emotive irony to the piece that is uniquely \xB5-Ziq. ""Swan Vesta,"" a long-time resident of my pantheon of perfect songs, eludes comparison. This song overwhelms the listener with its stylistic and emotional versatility-- the violent swaths of blistering snares, the melancholy strings, the idiosyncratic bleeps, the plaintive mechanical cries, the funky tribal interludes and the haunting clarity of the central eight-note refrain. The result is as ambiguous and intangible as it is blissful-- a liminal listening experience that not only makes you dance or think or cry, but compels you to do all of that at once. It's a hard act to follow, but Mike does his best. ""Iesope"" is a tranquil melodic number whose resonant cave-dubbed samples culminate in a powerfully understated three-note resolution. ""\xB5-Ziq Theme,"" one of several songs from Tango that involved the cooperation of Frank Naughton (he left the project to focus on schoolwork, but has since released a handful of solo songs on Spymania), brings the beat back amid a swirling arpeggio and a lush bed of mournful strings. ""Ad Misericordiam,"" previously available only on the vinyl issue of Tango, opens with the drone of gothic synth pads, then slowly phases in jangling percussion and squelchy electro melodies. The pace of the record flags with songs like ""Whale Soup"" and ""Die Zweite Heimat,"" but these disappointments comprise a clear exception to an otherwise consistently strong album. Paradinas mines a different vein with ""Xolbe 2,"" a subdued, rhythmic piece bathed in layers of tinny static. The new additions (""Driving Is Easy,"" ""Methyl Albion"" and ""Glink"") also go down well, though only ""Glink"" parallels the standard set by the original album. Even so, I have a hard time finding fault with their inclusion on the reissue-- all three songs offer something of value and, thanks to the absurd politics of the record industry, they won't run buyers any extra flow. Eight years ago, Tango n' Vectif offered to change the code of modern electronica. Until recently, its plea fell on deaf American ears. Now we've entered the 21st century, and in some respects, we're still catching up with what Mike Paradinas did in 1993-- perhaps the finest period of his career. You can call this record groundbreaking, or relevant, or just a real riot to listen to. I call it a masterpiece, and I don't think any IDM enthusiast can tell the sky from the ground without it.","In 1993, before the IDM phenomenon had drawn enough recognition to merit so much\n\ as a name, David Toop ...

Immaterial,Tomas Jirku,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba039d034d5c69bf5365/1:1/w_160/6e0dbb8b.jpg,2001-11-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4264-immaterial/,Alien8Substractif,"The second release for Substractif, the headphone/deep-listening subsidiary of the Canadian avant-garde label Alien 8, couldn't have set the roster up better. Tomas Jirku's Immaterial looks to the near imperceptible for inspiration. Though not widely recognized, Jirku's recording career has neatly suggested that he would soon release a genre-defining set. Having worked out his M.O. on the MP3 site NoType, Jirku released his sophomore album, last year's Variants, for Alien 8. That album collected a month's worth of clicks, pop, and righteous dub rhythms. The step from the suggestive Variants to the blatant club styles of his next release, Sequins, was a easy one. Sequins, released on the doyen of the click dance scene, Force Inc, ensured that Jirku would be admired in the same light as Mathias Schaffhäuser, Wolfgang Voigt, and Thomas Brinkmann. While it's true that none of the nine Sequins tracks would make it into Sasha and Digweed's sets, I'd not be baffled to find one in Andrew Weatherall's challenging selections. Immaterial shies away from maximum club exposure, though those mechanics are detectable. Four lengthy tracks named after subatomic particles begin the electron haze with Jirku slowly introducing classic Chain Reaction dub elements into the space. The signature tinkles, pops, and curved white noise are all abundant. Jirku maintains such immense control of these vaporous elements that his music seems to halt the flow of time, as only the finest dub can. With such discreet and attentive sounds as these, every reaction is going to be unique. To me, Jirku is investigating the Brownian motion of dust settling or how things come out in the wash. Immaterial is fixated on these processes. Jirku puts forth little effort to make each of the four tracks distinctive, and in fact, by using the sound of running water as a segue between each, he compels the listener to treat each track as part of a greater whole. In this regard, Jirku allies himself directly with Vladislav Delay, the Finnish minimal master, whose 2000 release, Anima, was a sixty-five minute exploration of minimal rhythm on Mille Plateaux, Force Inc's even more experimental parent label. Like Anima, Immaterial can be extremely demanding if the listener is intent on attending to each detail. While hardly an intellectual response, I've found that I've best appreciated the record by contradicting its demanding nature and treating it as an inconsequential environment. Immaterial transcends the piquant ambiguity of its title. However playfully Jirku tempts me to write this record off as inconsequential fluff, the album has a nebulous, evanescent beauty that keeps luring me back into its gaseous extent.","The second release for Substractif, the headphone/deep-listening subsidiary of\n\ the Canadian avant-garde label Alien 8, couldn't have ...

Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma,Songs: Ohia,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b79d034d5c69bf3129/1:1/w_160/3252bea2.gif,2001-11-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7337-mi-sei-apparso-come-un-fantasma/,Paper CupBlack and White,"Live albums are pretty much indefensible. Blatantly fan-milking and time-stalling, they rarely hold more than a passing charm. But I'm often a sucker for them all the same-- a connoisseur, you might even say. They have an aesthetic all their own, I mean, if you want to call it that, what with their near-obligatory guitar and drum solos, sing-alongs, and between-song banter. From B.B. King's Live at Cook County Jail and James Brown's Live at the Apollo to 70s rock classics like Frampton Comes Alive and Rush's A Show of Hands (a cassette of which rests in a shoebox under my bed at this very moment), live albums can offer a glimpse into the true heart of a band or artist. Of course, like some of the above-mentioned albums above, it might not be a pretty sight. The truth can be ugly. As someone who owns every Songs: Ohia release and who has attended about a dozen of the band's live shows, it's safe to say I'm already a certified fan, which makes me the perfect chump for a live disc. But if I imagine for a moment that I've never heard Songs: Ohia before and Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma (Italian for ""You come to me as a ghost"") came as my introduction to the band, it would make a fan out of me right quick. Recorded in Modena, Italy in September of 2000, Fantasma offers a better introduction to Songs: Ohia than the last couple of proper albums, which seemed like transitional or exploratory releases. But then again, Songs: Ohia is a band in constant flux; what began as Will Oldham-like ramblings on their self-titled 1997 debut had become a Berlin-period Bowie-inspired project by the time Ghost Tropic saw release last year. Songs: Ohia has essentially always been the vision of singer/songwriter Jason Molina and whoever else happened to be hanging out with him at the time, but Fantasma is the statement of a full-fledged working rock band, with the additional guitarist, bassist, and drummer fleshing out Molina's skeletal song structures without diminishing their power. The spotlight, though, as always, remains on Molina's powerful voice and lyrics, which at their best sound bleak, mournful, hopeful, and reconciliatory all at once. Five of eight songs here are untitled and as-yet unreleased elsewhere. That alone raises this release above the gratuitous repackaging-of-favorites cliché that too often makes up the live album experience. The untitled album-opener is probably the best song on Fantasma. Riding a halting riff and minimal snare crack, the song lurches along with almost unbearable weight, slowly building to Molina's opening verse: ""All those days, we don't have days like that left to us."" After ruminating on the body's ultimate demise without treading into maudlin or cliché territory, Molina and company rave it up in Crazy Horse fashion. Overall, it's about as classic a Songs: Ohia song as there is. The sixth track, also untitled, is another standout. Following a similar path as the opener, in terms of starting out slow and simple and then proceeding to a distortion-fueled outro, it shows off Molina's ability to craft a guitar riff so simple and powerful that you wonder why no one thought of it before. Lead guitarist Dan Sullivan's role is incredibly pronounced here, too, adding an bright, angular guitar riff that's equal parts Steve Malkmus and Neil Young. The only gratuitous moment comes with the next track, where the band gets all Dead-like with an intro jam that goes on a little long. But by song's end, they pull it together, and Sullivan's eerie ""For What It's Worth""-sounding riff ends the songs on a powerful, if somber, note. The three previously-released songs-- ""Tigress"" and ""Being in Love"" from 2000's The Lioness, and ""Cabwaylingo"" from the debut-- are reinterpreted enough to make them interesting in their own right, and not just in relation to the originals. This applies less to the former two, probably because the band was touring behind the album those songs are on, and not enough time had passed for them to change much. But the latter, the album-closing ""Cabwaylingo,"" is given a Dylan-esque reworking, with an extended intro and a completely different middle section, lyrically. It's a little treat for the longtime fans who've been paying attention all along: a convention of the live album Molina just couldn't bring himself to break away from. It sure beats a drum solo.","Live albums are pretty much indefensible. Blatantly fan-milking and time-stalling,\n\ they rarely hold more than a passing charm. But ...

The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions,Miles Davis,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bd5e6ef95969321298/1:1/w_160/421bac91.jpg,2001-11-07 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2199-the-complete-in-a-silent-way-sessions/,Columbia,"Miles had a new girl. Her name was Betty, and she told him all about what the kids were listening to. Being a singer herself, she had some connection to the inside world of pop and soul, but mostly, she was just a lot younger than him, and was probably instinctively more drawn to that music than Miles was. It's not as if Miles was completely out of touch with popular trends, but on tour and in the studio as frequently as he was, one could hardly blame him for receiving information second-hand. Betty told him all about Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and the Fifth Dimension (hopefully in that order), and he was keen to investigate the new sounds. Years later he would brag about being able to put together a rock band that would blow all the others away, but he approached the idiom cautiously and methodically at first. Additionally, Miles was getting insider info from his drummer, Tony Williams. Tony was younger even than Betty Mabry, and although he'd come of age deep inside one of the most popular bands in jazz (even if jazz's popularity wasn't what it had been ten years previous), he had his finger very much on the pulse of hip new music. Tony had especially enjoyed the new funk from James Brown and the boogaloo grooves being played by Jimmy McGriff and Richard ""Groove"" Holmes' bands. Betty and Tony were playing a key role for Miles Davis in the late 60s, even beyond their personal and performing ones. The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions release details a six-month stretch in 1968-69 when the various advisors in Miles' life would see their seeds sprout into fauna so full of life and outrageous fertility that the face of his idiom would be forever changed. Of course, the final product of all this investigation and experimentation has been the subject of countless essays on Miles' genius, but it bears closer inspection to reveal that the trumpeter didn't just up and create this music out of thin air. He spent months in the studio rehearsing on tape, midwifing his ideas. In late '68, Miles was a painter using one canvas to try and retry his masterpiece, continually repainting over areas where, though the ideas were fresh and the colors vibrant, the concept was yet immature. As a palette, Miles chose only the best primaries from two continents. At the time, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock were mainstays from his second great quintet. Bassist Ron Carter had become so busy with sessions in New York that Miles had to find a replacement. In between gigs in England, he saw Dave Holland's band opening for Bill Evans. Miles was immediately struck by the young bassist, and sent word via Philly Jo Jones and his manager (Miles had the best connections) that he wanted Dave. Elsewhere, when it became apparent Hancock was going to have trouble making a recording date, Williams recommended the young Boston native Chick Corea as a replacement. This quintet (Davis, Shorter, Williams, Holland and Corea) produced the first tunes on this release in September 1968. ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" is a sprawling ode to both Miles' new girl and Hendrix's ""The Wind Cries Mary."" Miles had started using electric keyboards in the studio almost exclusively by that time, and Corea's relatively conservative figures (when they aren't directly quoting the Hendrix tune), are the dominant timbre in this piece at first. He hadn't picked up the Fender Rhodes piano that would color almost every tune Miles performed thereafter, and the primitive sounds produced here betray the band's uncertainty about where the tune (or their sound) was going. Davis takes the first solo, similar to his exploratory efforts on Miles in the Sky earlier that year, over a non-groove from Williams' toms and Holland's steady, if rather static, low-end line. One of the reasons sets like this are great is that you really get a feeling for the musicians' progress during that time, and if this tune is any indication, things had only just begun to get interesting. ""Frelon Brun"" gives a much better idea of the revolutionary sounds ahead. Williams wastes no time in hammering out a hard funk break from the kit, and Corea had apparently already learned the importance of the repetitive chordal vamp to this music. Davis takes a short solo, as if testing the waters, which is followed by Shorter's seemingly more confident strides in funky acid soul. The music actually ends up closer to what the band played after Bitches Brew than anything on In a Silent Way. Two months later, Miles reconvened with the same musicians, adding Herbie Hancock on Rhodes to form a sextet, to begin the next phase of the trip. The band played music closer to Miles' vision on ""Two Faced"": mystical, impressionistic soundscapes courtesy of the two-keyboard attack, subtle, though insistent drumming from Williams, and a by-then typically moaning, weary head covered by Davis and Shorter. The band was also not afraid of stretching the tunes out to 10, 15, or 20 minutes if it meant they'd find something useful along the way. Miles (with the help of producer Teo Macero) had discovered tape edits from progressive pop records of the time (Sgt. Pepper being a chief influence), and this tune, similar to ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's About That Time,"" was constructed from several stop/start fragments. Later the same month, Miles found yet another missing ingredient in keyboardist (and über-influence on the sound of all resulting jazz-rock fusion) Joe Zawinul. The two men had known each other for several years prior to these sessions, but Miles could only admire the Austrian's playing from afar. Zawinul had made great strides in uniting jazz and soul with Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley's band in the mid-60s, even scoring a pop hit with ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy."" He also brought an earthy sense of melody and classicism to the mix, and would ultimately become a major architect for the sound of Miles' band. ""Splashdown,"" a previously unreleased piece of tense, Rhodes-led jazz-funk, was recorded with the first three-keyboard version of the band. However, Zawinul's influence wasn't really apparent until sessions from a couple of days later, when the band played two of his compositions: ""Ascent"" and the subsequent concert staple, ""Directions."" The former seemingly caught the band in transition, with its theretofore-unprecedented use of tonal clusters and rootless ""comping"" from the keyboards, and an absence of any drum pattern at all, save an odd tambourine pulse. ""Directions"" was another story altogether, as the band busts out of the peaceful into the wild. This was the most ""rock"" Miles Davis had sounded like up to that point, and the two versions of the tune on this set are very similar to what Miles' concerts would sound like from '69 through the early 70s. Also of note on this session is that drummer Jack DeJohnette made his first appearance with a Miles Davis band in the studio, lending his distinct, high-energy stomp to the proceedings. The band went on the road for a few months after that, and returned to the studio in February 1969. More changes: John McLaughlin had been recruited on guitar (another Tony Williams recommendation), and Williams had returned on drums. This time around, Miles was looking for what he called a ""groove album."" The strategy was that the band would play a tune (on this session, ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way""), based on charts, but were free to explore what regions the performance yielded to them. Afterwards, Miles and Teo would evaluate the pieces, and form the ""groove"" in Miles' head from whatever was on tape. The original, previously unreleased version of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" from that session will shock most people accustomed to the legendary In a Silent Way version. First of all, there's an exposition and melodic theme that was completely discarded in the proper version. Also, the famous robotic hi-hat pattern doesn't even begin until almost five minutes in. One of the surprises (some might even say disappointments) of this set is the realization that this music wasn't just the product of Miles' muse; there were hours of sessions and rehearsals before the band, Miles and Teo discovered what it was they were looking for. The humble beginnings of this tune still have much in common with straight jazz, though with a markedly progressive bent. The same session yielded two versions of ""In a Silent Way."" The first is very different to what ended up on the album, with a faux-bossanova beat and Holland's light-footed bassline supporting the classic melody line. The second version is the version that was used on the album, with McLaughlin's heavenly solo statement of the main theme, and Miles' delicate answer. The band also performed ""It's About That Time"" (definitely a fruitful afternoon) in what was essentially the final version, complete with tape edits and loops compiled by Teo. Two days later, Miles was back in the studio. He had a couple of new pieces, ""The Ghetto Walk"" and ""Early Minor,"" neither of which ended up on In a Silent Way. The first tune is a hard funk almost-blues featuring Joe Chambers laying down a slinky groove on drums, while McLaughlin, Shorter and Miles give up equally subversive solos. Most interesting is the middle section trip-down, wherein the ghost of the session two days prior sneaks in with a little atmospheric feather float. ""Early Minor"" is another Zawinul original that's indicative of the kind of hyper-impressionism he would play (with Shorter) with Weather Report shortly after making Bitches Brew with Miles. It's also confusing as to just why this didn't make the cut for the original In a Silent Way release, because it features similar cascading Rhodes figures, and very nice, gentle pulse keeping by Chambers. The set ends with the LP versions of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's About That Time."" Miles fans didn't get to hear everything that came in between this album and its predecessor, so the sessions documented on this collection will make the leap from the cautious dabbling in rock textures of Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro to the full-blown jazz-opera of Bitches Brew. These recordings seem a lot more logically arranged and planned. This is good and bad: while few people would doubt the genius of Miles Davis as a player, composer and bandleader, it's evident that he was running on blind faith more than once during that time, and that he was learning on the go as much as his sidemen were. Part of the mystique surrounding this album, for me, has always been that it seemed to come out of nowhere, like a beacon of uncanny originality and visionary foresight. Apparently, it did have roots, and while the music will always be some of my favorite from Miles, I can't honestly say that seeing the blueprints for his magic translates to the same sheer joy as did the end results. But, it's still magic music, and it's still Miles. The worst thing you could ever say about a set like this is that it's almost too educational, and of course, that's not really a criticism, is it?","Miles had a new girl.

Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24c9d034d5c69bf2b7a/1:1/w_160/ef7eea92.jpg,2001-11-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6745-yall-get-scared-now-ya-hear/,PIAS,"The Reindeer Section has me anxious. Not scared, ya hear, but anxious. I am nervous about the dilapidated state of popular music, predominantly inspired by love and romance. Creativity is dying and sentimental rubbish is settling in, all inspired by the big L. Thankfully, we can turn off MTV, get onto the Internet, and find a gold mine: there's an alternative to the triteness. And in a world where Wilco, of all bands, is dropped from a major label, independent music has become a surrogate mother. There is musical innovation and sincerity out there. But where does the Reindeer Section fit into all of this? Well, they've been deemed an indie supergroup, and their roster would appear to justify such a label with members from Mogwai, Belle and Sebastian, Arab Strap, Astrid, Snow Patrol, V-Twin, Mull Historical Society, Eva, and Hercules. The story goes that all of them were at a Lou Barlow gig in Glasgow when Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody suggested the idea: ""Everyone thought that it was a great idea but I'm sure they were thinking, 'Aye, right, Gary, whatever,' and that I'd forget about it when I sobered up. In fact, the next day I wrote the complete album."" Should we expect some mind-blowing material from this supergroup? Not quite. Whereas the output of the typical supergroup collapses from the weight of creative tension, the presence of most of the Reindeer Section's members barely exceeds the level of a standard collaboration. Y'all Get Scared Now, Ya Hear! debunks the supergroup designation with the first track, confirming that this is, for all intents and purposes, the project of Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody. ""Will You Please Be There for Me"" is a simple two-minute solo acoustic number vaguely resembling a simplified version of Badly Drawn Boy's ""Epitaph"" with all of the filtered flutter and bird noises replaced by straightforward white noise in the left channel. The first words we hear are, ""If I gave you my heart/ Would you give yours to me?,"" and the lyrical banality and romantic lamentations are sustained for the rest of the record against a backdrop that closely resembles Snow Patrol's acoustic moments. Lightbody writes in the liner notes that this entire record was written in one day and recorded in ten, and the lack of engagement shows. But it's not all tedium. The next track, ""The Opening Taste,"" features gorgeous vocal harmony between Lightbody and Astrid's Charlie Clark. ""12 Hours It Takes Sometimes"" wouldn't have sounded out of place on the Court and Spark's Ventura Whites debut with a lulling tempo, a slight lilt, and a distant piano. ""Tout le Monde"" stands out in its oddity; it's based on a driving guitar riff played by Mogwai's John Cummings that's looped alongside shifting harmonies (some repeating ""anywhere in the world"") while others just moan. Processed drum loops enter, along with timbaleze played by Belle and Sebastian's Richard Colburn. It turns out to be a bizarre, yet homogenous, dance number that's satisfying but undeniably out of place. Truthfully, I bought this record because the juxtaposition of Mogwai, Belle and Sebastian, and Arab Strap made an intriguing concept, but it never comes together. Mogwai's Cummings is the only member of any of these bands with a substantial presence here, playing guitar on 8 of the 14 tracks. And even then, his performances are muted by the ubiquity of Lightbody. Arab Strap's Aidan Moffat shows up once on ""Nytol,"" a song he lyrically co-write, but ultimately, the track comes off as a lightweight and lighthearted Arab Strap clone. Moffat's intonation, ""I think it must be the soap that you use,"" proves to be the lyrical apex of the record. Belle and Sebastian members Colburn and Mick Cooke appear on only four tracks total (but never simultaneously) playing percussion and brass, respectively. Which leads to the glimpse of light on Y'all Get Scared Now. ""Sting,"" easily the album's best track, features Cooke playing Spanish-inflected muted lines on trumpet and flugelhorn, Cummings on guitar, and layers of harmonies in a coda that proves to be simultaneously compelling and hopeful for the future of this group. You see, Gary Lightbody's already written another record for the Reindeer Section, including one track exclusively for Aidan Moffat. To which Moffat responded, ""Apparently, Gary's written a track for me already, so he's roped me in for that. It's that northern Irish accent, it gets me every time."" Maybe you should get back to sadness, Aidan.","The Reindeer Section has me anxious. Not scared, ya hear, but anxious. I am nervous about the dilapidated state of ...

Angles Without Edges,Yesterdays New Quintet,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b99d034d5c69bf2a15/1:1/w_160/9e8edc78.jpg,2001-11-06 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4176-angles-without-edges/,Stones Throw,"When I was four or five years old, my parents decided they'd had enough of the city life and moved into a very rural area about 30 miles from Austin, exposing me to a completely new side of American culture. After a few years of adjusting, I eventually embraced simple living and, naturally, the music of the simpler people. Then, one day, while driving into Austin, my mother was flipping channels on the radio when suddenly, amid the rants of early morning talk show hosts and adult contemporary, I heard the most glorious sound I have yet to hear. ""Miles Davis? Who the fuck is Miles Davis? Mom, why doesn't Rick Dees play Miles Davis?"" When I got home I tried desperately to find that station again. Why had I never listened to it before? I spent literally an hour tuning the knobs of my stereo until it finally struck me that all those damn trees that provided us country folk with clean air were also mitigating my reception. From then on, I always attended my mother's trips into the city. It allowed me to become familiar with all the college radio stations and the variety of music they played. Years went by. Owning a car facilitated my musical addictions and I discovered a place in my high school parking lot where I could pick up that one station perfectly. And thanks to that one song (""Blue in Green""), I became the man before you today. I've already heard a dozen or so ill-conceived comparisons made for Yesterdays New Quintet: DJ Shadow, Amon Tobin, Coltrane, even Squarepusher. None of these are radically far from the group's essential style (except maybe Squarepusher) but when names are dropped in such a succession, it usually spells out a rote, by-the-numbers album. Congratulations, YNQ-- you delivered! The record actually starts off fairly promising with decidedly downtempo beats supporting a Milt Jackson vibraphone line that gives way to a female MacInTalk voice reciting ""Yesterdays New Quintet"" continuously (as she does randomly throughout the record). The first of the DJ Shadow influences becomes apparent in the fractured beats of ""Julani"" (the group features a DJ in lieu of a live drummer) as drum fills are sampled, scratched, then strangely absent. ""Julani"" climaxes rhythmically and segues into ""Papa,"" a funk jam already in progress. It's ""Keeper of My Soul,"" however, that sets the formula for the album. The Quintet find a ""hook"" or a ""groove,"" pummel it into the ground using the same instrumental experiments as every other song (i.e. a wah-wah pedal and a Fender Rhodes), and then awkwardly fade out. That said, many of the tracks sound like excerpts from longer drone sessions. Hip-hop producer Madlib arranged this entire album, and many times, it appears that we're listening to unused or discarded backing tracks from his more successful endeavors as Quasimoto on last year's The Unseen. Angles Without Edges isn't guilty of being bad, just uninspired. Good jazz, like good electronic music, relies on many individually unique sounds to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Yesterdays New Quintet all too often sounds like a simple cut-n-paste job.","When I was four or five years old, my parents decided they'd had enough of the city life and ...

Lilac6,Lilac Time,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0feb335119a49ecdcd/1:1/w_160/8b93b0e8.jpg,2001-11-06 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4790-lilac6/,spinART,"Part of me hates this time of year. I gave up on organized religion a long time ago, so Christmas basically seems like just a big, over-commercialized holiday designed to deplete your savings and raise your blood pressure in the process. I mean, I love the light displays and seeing my family and all that, but there's something about the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day that just feels incredibly empty to me. But beyond that, I think what I hate is the darkness. Being on Daylight Savings Time here in New England means that the sun goes down around 4:00 p.m., and it drives me crazy. Walking back from class at 6:00 with a stiff, cold wind in my face and the sun nowhere to be seen, it's easy to see why bears hibernate during the winter-- it's probably the best way to cope emotionally with the winter months. So into this mindset enter the Lilac Time's sixth album, the second since their reunion in 1998. The Lilacs' last album, 1999's aptly titled Looking for a Day in the Night, fit this time of year for me fairly well. It was a well-constructed folk record full of mournful music and mostly hopeful lyrical themes, and it radiated a kind of sorrowful warmth that made me forget what time of year it was. But if that album found them looking for the day, then it's fair to say that Lilac6 shows them finding it. The thematic change is immediately apparent from the title of the first song, ""Dance Out of the Shadows."" The Lilac Time ride out into the light on richly strummed acoustics, with head Lilac Stephen Duffy singing about middle age and the necessary lifestyle changes that come with the territory. ""This Morning"" follows, and makes it readily apparent that the thematic shift isn't the only one present. Lilac6 is a much more musically upbeat album as well, and features a crop of enjoyable, summery pop songs that are hard to argue with in the middle of winter. ""This Morning"" sports a fluid, Motown-inspired bassline and dueling slide guitar and pedal steel lines. Second vocalist Claire Worrall is more prominent on this record than she was on the last one, handling the chorus beautifully and harmonizing seamlessly with Duffy. More obviously summer-themed is the excellent ""Jeans and Summer,"" a rocking little tune that nods to ""Louie Louie"" in the chorus before slipping into the catchy verse melody. The backing vocals and jangling guitars recall early REM, while the vocal round of exuberant ""bah-bah's"" that end the song evoke pre-Pet Sounds Beach Boys. Other uptempo songs lean away from sway back into the moody territory that the band plies so well, like ""Entourage,"" with its subtle French accordion accompanying lines like, ""I only love you when I'm drunk/ I'm alcoholic,"" and, ""I'm through with morality/ Can I sleep with your wife?"" Perhaps the band's greatest mood enhancer is the pedal steel of Melvin Duffy (no relation to brothers Nick and Stephen). His craft on the instrument is highly developed, and he's able to slip it into any context the band creates for him seamlessly. Sometimes, his playing has the country-ish quality the instrument is known for (""My Forest Brown,"" for instance), but for the most part, he manages to subvert the steel's stereotypical sound with richly melodic playing. His steel guitar holds a playful dialogue with Duffy and Worrall's harmonies on ""I Want to Be Your Man,"" a gently loping song stuffed full of finger-picked guitars and restrained percussion. The song gives way to one of the album's two Nick Duffy instrumentals, the rhythmic, darkly lyrical ""Jupe Longue."" Interlocking guitars swirl like flamenco dancers over dark accordion and organ chords, and the result is a strangely carnival-esque song. Unfortunately, the other instrumental, album closer ""June's Buffalo,"" isn't as engaging, plowing over urgently strummed acoustic guitar with an ugly accordion tone and a cheap, vaguely Caribbean rhythm. The steel drum sound at the conclusion may or may not be real, but it hardly matters, because the average listener will be working so hard to tune out what they're hearing that they won't notice one way or the other. It's too bad the album ends on such a negative note, because what precedes that is mostly engaging folk-rock that somehow manages a much broader appeal than most folk recordings. Part of this broad appeal lies in the fact that Stephen Duffy is a pop musician at heart-- an original member of Duran Duran (he left before they got big) and the man responsible for the mid-80s synth-pop smash ""Kiss Me"" as Tin Tin. Here, he's managed to take both of his tendencies and write a batch of songs that sit nicely somewhere between the two extremes. It makes for a record that sometimes feels a little too much like its head is in two different places, but ultimately, it holds together well. The overall result is an album that warms the spirit and takes some of the bite out the chill outside for forty-five minutes. And at this time of year, I could hardly ask for anything more.","Part of me hates this time of year. I gave up on organized religion a long time ago, so Christmas ...

Makoto Kawabata and Richard Youngs,Richard YoungsMakoto Kawabata,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb74abf31b7dc7155abe/1:1/w_160/4346e0c9.jpg,2001-11-06 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4393-makoto-kawabata-and-richard-youngs/,VHF,"Acid Mothers Temple is the perfect band for geeky record collector types: a semi-mythic history, a genuine Guitar God for a leader, and most important of all, a seemingly endless supply of side projects and related bands to fret over. Over the past year or so, a flood of releases from these ""Japanese psychedelic speed freaks"" has been unleashed to quench the thirst of rabid completists-- live albums, reissues, vinyl-only releases, etc.-- it can all be a bit daunting for the uninitiated. It's the kind of thing that kept me away from the Fall for so long, and to my ultimate regret once I finally took the plunge into their vast and intimidating discography. On this disc, Makoto Kawabata, the leader of Acid Mothers Temple, collaborates with Richard Youngs, a Scottish songwriter, sonic experimenter, sometimes librarian, and vegetarian cooking columnist probably best known for his musical partnerships with Simon Wickham-Smith, which often result in Dead C-ish noise sculptures. But he's also known to take a much more hermetic stance, composing such minimalist statements as ""Sapphie"" and ""Advent,"" the latter of which was recorded with only guitar and kazoo accompaniment. On paper, this Kawabata/Youngs pairing has all the making of a all-out aural assault. The easiest path they could have taken would have been for Youngs to record some ear-splitting, distorted garble and have it shipped to Kawabata who would superimpose an afternoon's worth of blistering guitar solos over it. And even though this record was a long-distance affair, Kawabata and Youngs did the right thing: they decided to listen to one another and shoot for subtlety over brute force. Youngs typically lays the foundation on these compositions, adopting one of his more meditative moods. Building upon autoharp, organ, or distantly droning tape sounds which constantly shift and realign, Kawabata fingerpicks his way back to Youngs' home turf, often recalling such British folkies as Bert Jansch or John Martyn. He slowly dwells upon an inner theme, never high-jacking the songs with his guitar for his own display. Youngs adds vocals on two of the five tracks, sometimes sounding oddly like Robert Pollard, other times like a more embittered Roger Waters. None of the tracks are titled; they're differentiated only by numbers and bars of different colors and lengths. The first track is the most traditionally song-oriented piece: a far off autoharp underpins Kawabata's bright, rollicking flat-picked steel-stringed acoustic work as Youngs sings about how, ""There's so much beauty now,"" in a heartbreakingly honest voice that can't be denied. The least accessible track is the second, which takes a dense swirl of autoharp and guitar notes and slowly submerges them in an organ drone that rises over the course of 12 minutes. But, all told, this is far from the difficult music you might expect from these two; my attention never wavered over its 42-minute running time. Admittedly, it would be a stretch to call this release essential, but it would be sad if music this good was confined to the collections of Acid Mothers Temple completists. It's much more suited to open-minded folk aficionados or even fans of electronic ambient and trance.","Acid Mothers Temple is the perfect band for geeky record collector types: a semi-mythic history, a genuine Guitar God for ...

The Blueprint,JAY-Z,by: Ethan P.,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d5c0084474cd0c26d3/1:1/w_160/c77499e7.jpg,2001-11-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4216-the-blueprint/,Def JamRoc-A-Fella,"""Damn right I love this life I live/ 'Cause I went from negative to positive/ And it's all... good."" --Biggie Smalls, ""Juicy"" ""H to the Izzo"" wasn't a summer jam for me. No TV, sadly, means no BET. I'm too far from ATL to get good radio, and the only thing bumping out the trunk at stoplights was that fucking White Stripes album. I was so deprived that when Nas pondered if Jay-Z might be ""H to the izzo/ M to the izzo,"" I didn't even get the damned reference. Approaching a Jay-Z album in a cultural vacuum is a dangerous venture-- something I haven't done since his 1996 debut, Reasonable Doubt-- and my hopes were a lot lower for this new one, which was rumored to be short on bigger-than-Jesus superproducers and entirely free of perpetual Roc-a-Fella sidemen Beans and Bleek (both of whom I've come to like far better than Jay himself). Honestly, I was expecting mediocre shit-- the worst kind of boredom that comes with return-to-my-roots formalism, or maybe a chorus or two from a children's musical. What I got was the plush defining statement from hip-hop's last great personality. The Blueprint is possibly the least sonically inventive hip-hop chart topper in years-- stunning and captivating for sure, but still loungily comfortable enough to sleep to. The songs are spare, but the care of assembly holds any leftover interest that Jay isn't already commanding. The unexpected flourishes are subtly beneficial, like the fanfare that sneaks in at the end of ""All I Need,"" or the incredible clap-clap break of ""Heart of the City."" Retro soul samples are dull white, picked clean of lint and sanitized. They're wielded like pieces of a glitch track around Jay's words, coming in at all the right moments and corporealizing into a clipped skeleton to drape his ego on. Disregarding ""Takeover"" (which is a separate world, anyway), he's left behind all the dirty funk of so many jams past; too powerful, too rich, too fucking refined to even be touched by such filthiness. It's easy-listening because his life is almost entirely easy living, and his only nuisances (bitch-ass rappers and the media, naturally) are shortly addressed in two quick jabs: laid-back dis track and Eminem guest shot. ""Takeover"" is the dis track. Casually flowing over a marching bassline and carbonated harpsichord flourishes, Jay slowly and confidently explains to you that Nas and Mobb Deep's Prodigy are the most wack, fake-ass thugs in the universe, and how he must destroy them. After it ends, you realize he was simply performing an obligation-- responding to a glove slap that's far beneath him, but entirely within his capacity to address. The abrupt final verse is the topper as Jay laughingly exhorts that, ""All you other cats throwin' shots at Jigga/ You only get half a bar, fuck y'all, niggaz."" How does Jadakiss even begin to respond at that? As for the rest, well, there's nothing really awful (the cringeworthy track or two that seems to lurk at the end of every Jay-Z album is notably absent), but there's nothing really shocking, either. But the other tracks are so forward-moving and hallucinatory that even Timbaland can't stab his way out of the haze. What holds it together is Jigga's overwhelming self-assuredness-- the kind of justified confidence you can imagine witnessing from a world conqueror or cult leader. When the pitchshifted chorus of ""U Don't Know"" exclaims, ""You don't know... what you're doing,"" Jay is quick to respond: ""Sure, I do."" He then goes on to casually add up his yearly earnings and ponder the total like Mos circa Mathematics if possessed by Gordon Gekko, and you realize that this is for real: Shawn Carter finally entirely synchronized with the Jigga-man rapping persona for an entire album. Gradually, the other tracks start to make sense; ""Hola Hovito"" is a Swizz Beatz eulogy with Roger Troutman shouting nonsense from the bathroom. ""Jigga That Nigga"" is all the lovely French females from ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" asking him to kick it 1998-style once again. ""Heart of the City,"" possibly the best song that actually works in the style of the album, deftly grinds with tiptoeing smoothness like a bugged-out Cluster track while Jay makes a convincing case for holding it down six summers straight. ""Niggaz pray and pray on my downfall/ But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like round ball."" Bouncing up means coming down, and he does for ""Renegade,"" teaming with the world's other greatest MC to whine about the perils of being the world's greatest MCs and all. I shouldn't have to mention the brilliant rhymes, but (surprisingly, after a few bombs on the d12 album) it's almost ridiculous how good Eminem's beat is-- strings, synth and ""Good Vibrations""-style theremin tones roll easy like 1987. After that, Jay puts focus in full on his rep, bigging up Reasonable Doubt more times than every other cut of his career combined. Jay's always been moving towards abolishing the hardcore production style that originally went with being gangsta, but the funny thing about this is how overwhelmingly post-gangsta he is-- the fruits of a thug life that was too long ago to dwell on. ""If I ain't better than B.I.G./ I'm the closest one,"" he says on ""Hola Hovito,"" and that's an important clarification; when Puffy and Easy Mo Bee were laying pop beats under Biggie's real-life crime stories, the old school heads complained about how the rugged and rough aesthetic was on the way out. But ""Juicy"" shut the haters up by simply explaining that Biggie was pop only because he didn't need that dirty funk-rock life anymore. And so, while frat boys went buckwild for screeching thugs like Cypress Hill and Onyx who boasted of a running crime rate, Biggie had already gotten over it and just wanted to live his life in peace. But everyone knows what actually happened, and after his crime style finally caught up with him, the new generation of pop thug was ushered in. After Biggie's death, no one comes closer than Jay-Z.","""Damn right I love this life I live/ 'Cause I went from negative to positive/ And it's all... good ...

When,Vincent Gallo,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bee05e6ef959693232f7/1:1/w_160/2c4f4ba4.jpg,2001-11-06 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3384-when/,Warp,"Point to any portion of Vincent Gallo's career-- from his acting in any of a number of underrated independent films, to his work with Jean-Michel Basquiat in the short-lived New York band Gray; from the writing at his self-maintained website, to his twisted directorial debut Buffalo 66-- and you'll always find something a bit off-kilter. Of course, it's in this very awkwardness that Gallo's appeal lies. In the aforementioned film-- parts of which are admittedly autobiographical-- Gallo plays a loser named Billy who returns, upon his release from prison, to his hometown. On his first day back, he kidnaps a young girl, takes her to his parents' house for dinner, forces her to pretend she's his wife, and then proceeds to wander around town with her trailing closely behind. Over the course of the film, Billy realizes that there's nothing for him in this town, that he's every bit as lost as he'd been before jail. He recognizes the girl as his possible salvation, but finds himself too petrified to act upon this realization. Gallo wrote, directed, scored, and starred in the film; this hands-on approach no doubt the cause of much of its emotional resonance. He approaches When, his solo musical debut, in much the same way. Not only is Gallo the sole writer, performer and producer credited here, but his songs are imbued with the same emotional nakedness that made Buffalo 66 so engrossing. Throughout the album, but on ""Honey Bunny"" in particular, Gallo appears to be mocking traditional lovesong lyrics. ""Huh-uh-nee Buh-huh-nee,"" he sings in a faux-Prekopian swagger, dragging out each syllable, pausing between each pair as though to decide which romantic cliché best fits his intentions: ""My Bay-ay-bee... girl... friend."" Later, on ""Laura,"" he repeats the titular figure's name a few dozen times, growing more desperate with each go-round. The sheer vapidity of these lyrics gives When the feel of a very private affair, like we're standing outside the door to Gallo's room while he sits on his bed inside, guitar in hand, wallowing in self-pity. This voyeuristic effect is reminiscent of much of Smog's earlier work, though the means by which the two artists achieve it couldn't be further apart. The ingenuity here is not in the lyrics, but entirely in their delivery. Listening to When, one can't help but wonder if this is how Andy Kaufmann's audiences felt. As Gallo speak-sings, ""Goodnight baby/ Sleep tight here with me/ We can lay in the bed, you and me/ And I won't go away or leave you alone/ Sweetie-pie/ Baby/ Sleep tight/ Here with me,"" on ""Apple Girl,"" we're left scratching our heads, wondering if the effect is intentional or not. I can only assume, based on Gallo's work as a filmmaker and his arrangements on some of When's more ambitious tracks, that it is. Gallo may be self-indulgent, but he's certainly not oblivious. ""I Wrote This Song for the Girl Paris Hilton,"" the disc's opener, begins with a short looped sample of an unwavering horn note, with guitar and drums in the background. Slowly, Gallo builds a song out of other sampled instruments-- a guitar here, an organ there-- piling them atop the relentless three-second foundation. The arrangement is clunky in the same way that a U.S. Maple song is, but this doesn't diminish its beauty. If anything, it serves as allegory for a mind we're led to assume is somewhat shaky and nervous. Consider it an early warning that the songs which follow are going to be a bit off kilter. The instrumentation is lush as can be, while the ever-present loop has a lulling effect that prepares listeners for the slow but beautiful ride through Gallo's fragile psyche to come. When he samples an old recording of vibraphones on ""Was,"" it's not the melody, but the actual sound that affects. Gallo's placement of the flat, faded, somewhat muted old recording over his own full, lush guitar strokes makes for an intriguing parallel. The sample, much like his character in Buffalo 66 and-- we're drawn to assume-- Gallo himself, doesn't quite belong. Yet, there's an undeniable beauty to the unlikely pairing. Musically, most of When is sparse, reminiscent of the more haunting moments on Archer Prewitt's Gerroa Songs or a more subtle, less dynamic Bedhead. A lightly picked guitar and barely audible bass make up the bulk of the accompaniment to Gallo's nearly androgynous crooning, with the occasional string section that fades out as quickly as it came in. The result, when added to the often repetitive vocals is captivating, almost hypnotic. But once again, Gallo proves he's more aware than he lets on. On the next track, ""My Beautiful White Dog,"" a gently plucked guitar continues to wander aimlessly, but it does so over a dirty old drum loop and an ominous string section which serves as a wake-up call, yanking the listener to attention after the calm opening tracks. There's no denying that When is an exercise is self-indulgence. Much like Bufallo 66, it's an effort that, while deserving of respect and maybe even a bit of envy, is riddled with flaws. Just as some of the characters in his film lacked a backstory or a sense of purpose, so does When. Though gorgeous and inexplicably well-crafted, it lacks scope; far too content to swim in circles in a pool of Gallo's emotions to ever strike ground that truly resonates. And even though their ambiguity often lends the lyrics much of their weight, it'd be nice to hear Gallo take a swing at something with a bit more depth than, ""I'm always sad when I'm lonely/ I'm always sad."" Still, When is a gorgeous collection of songs which paint an undeniably clear picture of their creator. If, with his next project-- be it music, film or something else-- Gallo attempts to broaden his range, to understand something besides himself, there's no telling what heights he might reach.","Point to any portion of Vincent Gallo's career--\n\ from his acting in any of a number of underrated ...

Anthem of the Moon,Oneida,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d9ea9e61561daa70b1/1:1/w_160/341bb018.jpg,2001-11-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5998-anthem-of-the-moon/,Jagjaguwar,"I think the time has about come for us to give up the moon as a subject of mysterious fascination. No longer reliant on shaky geocentric world views, and having scientifically proven that the moon is neither home to malicious space invaders nor made of tasty green cheese, I think we're ready to move on to something new. There's a whole universe of bizarre, mysterious things out there-- black holes, dying stars, unexplored distant galaxies-- it seems kind of sad at this point that we still seem to be fascinated with a big rock that's only a few hundred thousand kilometers from earth. Anthem of the Moon, Oneida's fourth full-length album and second for Bloomington, Indiana's Jagjaguwar label, certainly carries with it some of the mystery that's often been attributed to the rocky satellite it's named after. With album art depicting odd rock formations, ancient instruments, naked guys on horses, and quasi-astrological imagery, and a sound that never seems completely settled or together, Anthem of the Moon isn't an album that gives itself away immediately. As one familiarizes oneself with the record, though, it becomes clear that there's some great, if sometimes uneven, music buried just beneath the record's surface. Oneida puts their most hectic foot forward, opening the album with ""New Head,"" a synthesizer- and feedback-driven riff-rock number with a simple, if not particularly memorable chorus and some hints of melody buried in the song's midsection. That hint of melody is expanded upon with ""All Arounder,"" the best track here, and the one that best manages to reconcile Oneida's frenetic, unfocused sound with their ability to write memorable songs. Like its predecessor, ""All Arounder"" is sonically a mess, with guitars, synthesizers, bass and drums melding together into a swirly cloud of sound. The distinct, catchy vocals on the track provide a welcome contrast to its instrumental backing, a contrast that Oneida uses to their advantage throughout Anthem of the Moon. Starting with ""Geometry,"" Oneida also begin to utilize some heavy contrast between consonance and dissonance. The synthesizers and vocals in ""Geometry"" don't match up harmonically at first, and when the song later shifts into a dreamy major chord passage, the contrast is striking. If the variety and contrast of this song were held up throughout Anthem of the Moon, the album would be nothing short of spectacular. Unfortunately, the quality of songwriting on the record is far from consistent. Songs like the 5+ minute-long ""Still Rememberin' Hidin' in the Stones"" and the infuriatingly repetitive ""Dead Worlds"" just serve as reminders that effects pedals and feedback can't make a boring song good. On ""Dead Worlds,"" in fact, the screeching guitar feedback that pops up every once in a while sounds completely out of place, bordering on annoying. Indeed, the freaky sounds that permeate Anthem of the Moon really aren't what make it good at all. Sure, they add some flavor and perhaps an air of mystery, but cool sounds aside, Oneida can write some really, really great songs. For all its strangeness, Anthem of the Moon isn't all that different from the moon itself: it's really just rock.","I think the time has about come for us to give up the moon as a subject of mysterious fascination ...

Feminist Sweepstakes,Le Tigre,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb95e6ef95969322ee4/1:1/w_160/da9e1c53.jpg,2001-11-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4705-feminist-sweepstakes/,Mr. Lady,"Early in my freshman year of college, I was severely reprimanded and summarily cold-shouldered by the newly formed Womyn's Collective for the following suggestion: ""I think maybe riot grrls have it pretty easy, comparatively speaking."" Silence. I squirmed a bit in my seat, and felt stares of my classmates so hot with accusation that I swore I could feel the skin burning off my face. The girl in charge (who would never admit to being in charge-- after all, this was a radical feminist organization and hierarchy is a patriarchal construct) cleared her throat ominously: ""Would you mind clarifying your comment, Alison?"" I swallowed, stymied. How the hell do I get out of this one? I mean, this is an all-women's college, and I've just cleared the path to take the sacred cow to the slaughtering block. So I followed through. ""Well, clearly I'm not going to make friends no matter what I say, so I might as well finish what I started. ""It's like this: I think riot grrls are allowed, even encouraged, to play music of a significantly lesser quality than their male counterparts. I know it's punk rock to sound all raw and simplified, but it seems like riot grrls are allowed to be as bad as they want because they're largely cute and spunky and, well, girls. I mean, rock and roll has been a boy's club for years, and that should change, but our collective inability to put riot grrl bands under the same scrutiny we put any other band... I mean, isn't that kind of patronizing?"" The surrounding faces went near purple with rage. And yeah, I was only eighteen, but I knew how to take a hint. I left. Approximately seven years to the day of my Womyn's Collective debacle, I find myself reviewing Le Tigre's second album, Feminist Sweepstakes, with some degree of trepidation. Seven years clears a lot of air. Of course, I'm less of a contrarian these days, and to be fair, some of those ex-riot grrls have made some really extraordinary music outside the confines of the movement they created. Kathleen Hanna among them. Since the demise of Bikini Kill, Hanna has carved out some fairly innovative sounds, both with Le Tigre and alone as Julie Ruin. Using samples, drum loops, fuzzy guitars and synthesizers, Le Tigre has created an infectious mode for delivery of heavy-handed polemic, as evidenced by their self-titled debut. It was-- to quote Feminist Sweepstakes' ""F.Y.R.""-- ""one cool record in the year of rock rap."" And one of the best records I'd heard in a long time. Feminist Sweepstakes doesn't deviate much from the first album's sound, despite the change in line-up; shortly after the release of Le Tigre's 1999 self-titled debut, JD Samson of the underground dance troupe Dykes Can Dance replaced video artist Sadie Benning. The model is basically the same: hip-hop and disco-informed dance tunes undercut with punk rock adrenaline levels and post-feminist diatribes. Only time out, it's more of a dance party. The opener, ""LT Tour Theme,"" uses a spare 60s throwback dance sound and heavy metal guitar solo samples, over which Le Tigre sing, ""For the ladies and the fags, yeah/ We're the band with the roller skate jams, yeah."" And songs like ""Fake French"" and ""Well Well Well"" marry hip-hop and new wave, coming off something like more sophisticated takes on Blondie's ""Rapture."" Though it would be premature to accuse Le Tigre of mellowing with age-- especially with the shouted tirade on ""F.Y.R"" indicating the contrary-- there are moments when the ranting subsides. ""TGIF"" closes with the refrain, ""We got friends in sight/ Tomorrow we fight/ Let's have fun tonight."" Likewise, the album's closer, ""Keep On Livin',"" turns empowerment catchphrases into anthemic, garage punk fun. And there, with the vengeful faces of the Womyn's Collective burned into my brain, is where I levy my single complaint. Feminist Sweepstakes wants to be a terrifically fun album, yet with no deviation from the ceaseless politics and endless drum machine beats, things go stale. There are a growing number of female bands out there with the same basic premise as Le Tigre (most notably Chicks on Speed), making idiosyncratic dance pop for politically minded scenesters. Still, good as these things may seem, they rely too heavily on fad and can at times look a bit like novelty.","Early in my freshman year of college, I was severely reprimanded and summarily cold-shouldered by the newly formed Womyn's ...

LU,LU,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8cabf31b7dc7155f87/1:1/w_160/193724d6.gif,2001-11-05 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4905-lu/,DarlapulCec,"""We went up to the three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on their torrid breasts. I stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier, but revived at once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that threatened my stomach. The raging broom of madness swept us out of ourselves and drove us through streets as rough and deep as the beds of torrents... on we raced, hurling watchdogs under doorsteps, curling them under our burning tires like collars under a flatiron. Death, domesticated, met me at every turn, gracefully holding out a paw, or once in a while hunkering down, making velvety caressing eyes at me from every puddle."" And that's just the translation from Italian. Almost overnight, F.T. Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism birthed a new art movement that reflected the modern tensions of the 20th century. His kinetic language stoked fires in the minds of young Italian men, disgruntled at the end of that first decade with an Italy lagging behind the rest of industrialized Europe. They painted, they wrote, and they raced cars, their works mixing and clashing with Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, and all the avant-garde movements of the era. They castigated museums, universities and other keepers of static culture, and their cult of masculinity and hedonism incited outraged riots, and nightmares in more than a few. Ultimately, Futurism was a radical movement, and it mostly attracted radicals. It died out as an official ideology within a decade, but its impulse lives on in various forms. In music, the impulse can be heard in the works of musicians like Varese, Cage, Stockhausen, and in the public's scandalized reaction to jazz. Which gets me to thinking about today's popular indie bands, and how lazily we consider them to be cutting-edge-- why don't we demand as much as the Futurists did? LU offer a partial answer to that question. On their self-titled debut they've recorded some of the best techno-futuristic rock instrumentals I've heard in a long time. They're direct descendants of the Krautrock sound, but please don't expect me to flourish the overused word ""motorik"" like I'm Joe Critic-- LU drummer Dan Searing does more than just chug monotonously. His crisp chops are complemented perfectly by bassist Kristaps Kreslin's minimalist style. And Matthew Dingee plays brilliantly, like he's compressed all the electronic quarks and pulsars from Tortoise's Standards into the strings of his guitar. It's one of the first releases for pulCec, a subsidiary of Darla Records founded by producer Trevor HollAnd. But don't worry, robot-rockers: all the synthesized handclaps and gyroscopic grooves come through loud and clear. ""Mood Elevator,"" the album's first track, propels forward with a bass drum and snare stamp-click-stamp-click as methodic as the driving bass. Then Dingee's guitar worms its way into the mix, building a gentle anthemic vibe. The label likens these guys to New Order, but only because the warmth of the melody is thrown into such stark contrast by the background's cold precision. Gears shift quickly for the second song, and the comparisons to Neu! all begin to make sense. ""Biometric Authentication"" exists somewhere between retro and futurism, with the bass pulse impersonating the sensors, and the sparse guitar knifing out fractal geometry that would make Michael Rother jealous. Other song titles convey similar functionality. ""Aquarium Furniture"" drifts along on constant cymbals and a subaquatic bassline. Dingee's reverb pierces the depths with seductive grace, each wavering chord casting reflections through the medicated haze. ""Hot Knives"" pivots again on the rhythm section; the bass whirs and the drums multiply in skittering waves, evidence either of an electronic kit or Pro Tooling. The guitar jeers and lures with all the entente of Rush (yes, Rush), and the weird samples smirk like one of Toenut's rabid jams. And who can resist a ride on the new wave keyboards and funky bassline of ""International Supercock?"" The two-word titles and the black-and-white of the bold LU font are just reflections of the band's binary structure. Each song becomes a perpetual motion machine, the rhythm section shifting in synchronous harmony through multiple motifs and time signatures. Of course, what they do isn't new-- you could replace every reference to ""LU"" in this review with ""Trans Am,"" and it would still be pretty accurate. The Futurists probably wouldn't like LU after a few exposures-- they'd see how the band, like Trans Am, presents an image that's far more futuristic than the actual substance of their music. But listen to how pretentious these guys were: ""Let us now, as Futurists, enter one of these hospitals for anaemic sounds. There: the first bar brings the boredom of familiarity to your ear and anticipates the boredom of the bar to follow. Let us relish, from bar to bar, two or three varieties of genuine boredom, waiting all the while for the extraordinary sensation that never comes."" Luigi Russolo wrote that in his manifesto, ""The Art of Noises,"" pertaining to how they wanted to make music from samples of everyday city sounds. Yeah, elitism can be funny, but just as you can only listen to so many hours of Merzbow, you can only get off on liposuction sound-source albums for so long. And to think: all they'd need to do is wander down to D.C.'s Pharmacy Bar, owned by LU bassist Kristaps Kreslin, and play a few tracks from this album on the jukebox. They wouldn't have found the future they were seeking, but they'd have had their asses rocked, and maybe even gotten a free beer out of it.","""We went up to the three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on their torrid breasts.

Somniloquy EP,Pram,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10fc0084474cd0bfd12/1:1/w_160/12c5cccd.jpg,2001-11-05 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6443-somniloquy-ep/,Merge,"Some people don't get excited at the prospect of a new Pram release. They're not intrigued to discover what aspect of their comfortable childhood will be warped in the lo-fi playroom phantasmagoria that Rosie Cuckston and her chums call existence. Perhaps the subdued tack that the band has taken on Somniloquy will soothe dissenters into compliance. Ever since 1998's North Pole Radio Station, Pram have been rounding off the angles of their early albums, Helium and Sargasso Sea. The songs the band recorded were strangely alluring carnivorous plants with brightly colored barbs. Those barbs were defenses against the world's complaisance. But as the band's melodies became more hummable, their lyrics became ever more menacing. And their new nine-track EP, Somniloquy, begins with a superb example of this tactic. Though it relies on a low-rent Mondo Exotico melody, ""Mother of Pearl"" is, in fact, a dime store rendering of one of Henry Fuseli's surrealist paintings. Cuckston sings with Björk-ish glee, ""Teaching snails to make pearls/ Coating with plastic an elastic world,"" which reminds me of the incidental nocturnal mutants that border Fuseli's gracefully ghoulish rendering of ""Oberon and Titania."" ""The Way of the Mongoose"" is the first of three previously unreleased tracks, and harkens back to Pram's earlier tinkling on the borders of melody. Here, the band smacks away at various objects not previously recognized for their musical properties before a mariachi-like trumpet sets the party up with a solid Latin thumpathon. ""Monkey Puzzle"" begins as spy-flick bossanova while Cuckston incongruously sings about wanting to live in a ""tropicoloured world"" without ""black or white interpretations."" The song won't add significantly to the world's appreciation of Pram, but neither does it disgrace the noble institution of the b-side. Before the five remixes that most punters are going to leap on, Pram deliver the tender fairy lullaby, ""Clock Without Hands."" With the starkest of backing, Cuckston waltzes and lops from side to side as she sings about a man who's slept for all his life, and the endless web that binds us all together. It begs the question: is Rosie a Jedi master or just a discrete bondage freak? Like-minded infantalists Plone remix ""Bewitched"" from The Museum of Imaginary Animals. And though they don't enhance the song all that much, their treatment has provoked me into digging out my copy of their For Beginner Piano album, if only to persuade myself that they aren't just a tax write-off for Warp Records. ""Play of the Waves,"" taken, again, from The Museum of Imaginary Animals, is slightly glitched and ridden low to the rocky road in the Balky Mule mix. Elsewhere, Terry:Funken's remix of North Pole Radio Station's ""Omnichord"" evolves from a brooding, burbling bossa nova to a clanking Heath Robinson machine of an instrumental that fellow retro-futurists Manual would sell off some of their Red Army memorabilia for. Overrated Twisted Nerve sneaker-freak Andy Votel continues in his underwhelming streak with his lackadaisical treatment of ""The Last Astronaut."" Instead, Sir Real's reworking of ""A Million Bubbles Burst"" walks away with tonight's big cash prize. Unlike the other remixers, Sir Real meets Pram on their own territory and takes them on his own ride. In this case, what begins as ""Pram visit the Klanger settlement of Oliver Postgate's vision of the Moon"" is hijacked by John Bonham's planet-pounding drums. The track is outstanding and, as the title of this EP suggests, it's the track that even hitherto Pram dissenters will be talking about in their sleep.","Some people don't get excited at the prospect of a new Pram release.

Incommunicado,Kammerflimmer Kollektief,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb65c0084474cd0c284c/1:1/w_160/bc9df466.gif,2001-11-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4380-incommunicado/,PayolaTemporary Residence,"I imagine there must be a number of record store managers out there still wondering who or what this Kammerflimmer Kollektief is. After all, while Thomas Weber (the man behind the name) isn't exactly flooding the shelves with releases as quickly as say Acid Mothers Temple, he's still had three releases hit the bins stateside in little under a year. Two of those releases (both Mäander and this newest on Temporary Residence) were domestic issues of once import-only discs, while the recent Hysteria was a new recording for Japan's After Hours label. With three titles (and likely another on the way, noting Weber's prolific nature) in such a short time, many people out there might be scratching their heads wondering which, if any, of these titles to pick up. So, where does Incommunicado stack up next to the other two? Well, it's somewhere in the middle. In contrast to Payola label mates Tied and Tickled Trio (whose contributors usually number anywhere from 5 to 12 members), this ""kollektief"" started out as just one guy doing everything. But sometime after those first singles, Weber must've figured the band should live up to its name, so he recruited five other skilled musicians who've since stuck around. While Weber busied himself with electronic manipulations and studio tricks on Hysteria, there's no sign of it here as he plays only guitar. In fact, excepting Anne Vortisch's synthesizer, this is the most organic recording for the group to date. Those familiar with Mäander might spot a few recognizable track names on this release. The title Incommunicado means ""improvisations"" and that seemed to be the impetus for this experiment. Apparently, Weber handed out copies of that earlier release to members of his sextet and asked them to study the song structures, tone and composition for a future recording. The result is what we have here. A clever ploy by Weber to recycle previously used material? Not so much. The three carry-over tracks (""Nachtwach,"" ""Gras"" and ""Rand"") are faintly identifiable incarnations of earlier versions. They've been altered in every shape imaginable, sometimes stretching out onto a lengthier jazz terrain and sometimes veering out of control, reduced to disruptive sax squawks, shrieks and machine-gun percussion. These loose improvisations do a stellar job retaining Kammerflimmer's distinctive sound of rhythmic tensions building into explosive bursts of noise. ""Nachtwach"" slinks into the picture first and it becomes obvious immediately that this isn't going to be Weber's show. Reduced to mainly a background fixture on guitar, this album belongs to bassist Johannes Frisch and saxophonist Dietrich Foth. Frisch wastes no time launching the band out of the gate and digs his heels in as the band pieces together a new version of Weber's composition. That characteristic blast of noise still makes its presence known, though. Playing around the original theme at the start, the sextet eventually careens after a few minutes into Foth's high register squeals and Michael Ströder's punctuated bouts with the drum kit. The identifiable ""Gras"" follows and the group immediately references the original track before slowly assembling a wholly new sound entity. Building at a much slower pace than anything else on the disc, the group allows space and silence to have as vital a role in this piece as their playing. Extending far past the 12-minute mark, this is just about as quiet and evocative a song as anything they've ever done. Violinist Heike Wendelin and Foth begin to fill the space with sporadic noises, quivering drones out of the violin and tiny squeaks from the sax. About 10 minutes in, things start to get a little haywire as Frisch begins to bang his bow against the bass strings. Ströder at times pretends he's keeping time with a marching band, while Foth sends forth a handful of shuddering shrieks from the sax. Stretching out into epic territory, ""Gras"" is the finest moment here. It's reliant as much on sparseness and Kammerflimmer's members listening to each other as it is the group playing together. With seemingly no pressure to sustain the ordinary rhythmic tension, the individual members are able to explore different sound regions and bounce new ideas off each other. Along with the other two Mäander tracks, there's ""Rand,""a truncated sound detonation that ends as quickly as it begins. Lasting only 50 seconds, it's a feverish, ecstatic blast with every member playing as loud and abrasive as the next. Coming off like a live, improvised version of Weber's signature burst of static hiss and tape noise, the worst part about the song is its abruptness; it ends so quickly it leaves the listener salivating for more. Instead of lurching into something expected like a dissonance-filled wall of sax wail and shrill violin, the band quickly drifts into a Robert Wyatt cover: ""Venti Latir"" from his early 90s EP A Short Break. It's a beautiful violin-driven update of the original, lilting gently back and forth on Wendelin's strings. It's a rarity for Weber's group, placing more emphasis on the swaying melody than rhythm or shaping the tension. The final two tracks are new songs, ""Kissen"" and ""Holler."" The first of the two is a directionless drone centered on the synthesizer, violin and bass. Problem is, the band doesn't really allow itself enough space or time to pull the track into anything more than a gliding mess and the whole thing ends up sounding out of place. ""Holler,"" on the other hand, is a sheer delight. It's less than a minute of Frisch vehemently scraping his bow across the bass strings, the result being something analogous to that of John Cale or Tony Conrad's abrasive string treatments in Dream Syndicate. With only six tracks (three of those being revisions of earlier songs), Incommunicado might seem to fall short. However, this is an album that requires time to unfold. I'm in the unique position of having been one of the people who bought the earlier import version of this, which was released almost simultaneously with Mäander overseas. Having had time to digest this album more than I normally would with a review, I can say that, at first, it seems like a disjointed affair with tracks like ""Gras"" wandering purposelessly around and the bursting ""Rand"" and ""Holler,"" which both stand in contrast to that meandering exploration. But given repeated listening and time to unfurl, the pieces here stand alongside the best stuff in Weber's bag of tricks, proving that he's as adept in the group improvisation setting as he was flying solo in the studio.","I imagine there must be a number of record store managers out there still\n\ wondering who or what this ...

It's 1995,Western Automatic,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa079d034d5c69bf3d77/1:1/w_160/6f733f42.gif,2001-11-04 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8635-its-1995/,Loosethread,"Some people just can't appreciate good ambient music. I mean, how many times have you seen Orb albums in the used bins? Orbus Terrarum is one of the best albums I've ever heard-- an entire ecosystem pressed into the polycarbonate spirals of a compact disc-- and that doesn't save it from being discarded like so much trash. It's a busy world, and I guess few have the time for a listening experience that involves patience and effort, but they're missing out on one of music's most rewarding pleasures: sublime absorption in a world of sound. As head of the Western Automatic project, Matt Christensen employs techniques similar to the digital minutiae of the Orb. It's 1995, his debut, builds its soundworld on the lazy continental driftings of bass dub and populates it with the filtered fuzzscapes of Pan Sonic. The album's title is deceiving; it was, of course, recorded in 2000. What seem to be wedding pictures fill the sleeves, and the blank swaths of green where faces should be (clearly, an homage to Boards of Canada) leave little clue to the strange title. The minimalist packaging may have contributed to this album slipping notice last year, and it's a shame: this third release on the Loose Thread label is immensely rich and seductive. A refrigerator-like hum starts ""A Lady Captain"" with a subdued vibe. Fuzzy static germinates, rolling in soft waves as beats start to sprout at the crests. I'm amazed by the sense of narrative development here-- little beeps and drones guiding the listener along the path whenever the course starts to get repetitive. ""The Gods Hate Kansas"" continues the psychedelic evolution, with echoing keyboard accents spaced out across the terrain. This disc makes different listening environments necessary; you can only truly feel the slow, seismic bass shifts on stereo speakers. Likewise, the brushing cilia at the beginning of ""Painted Doctor"" are best heard with headphones. But beats fade in soon and invigorate all the ambience, keeping it from becoming sterile airport music. Things gets funky later on with ""Soultrain Alaska,"" as a five-note descending bassline brings pulsing dub revolutions. The pleasing grooves and squirmy keyboards could only be referred to as Lee Scratch Pet Land Perry. Christensen's also not afraid to get abstract. The glacial hulk of ""Queen of Princeton"" fractures from the slo-mo syncopation of its percussion, as a sea of synthlines undulate underneath. It's difficult, as you're listening to the cybernetic snores of ""Friends of Mine,"" to believe that parts of these songs were recorded live. But Christensen's technique for It's 1995 was to prerecord a number of drone landscapes and then play his keyboard improvisations over the mix. You can detect his impressive human touch on tracks like ""Make a Movie,"" though, as the inverse-whirlpool-flow spits up sharp synth jabs and quirky chord progressions. A listen to the entire album reveals these lovely moments, similar to the overlapping organics of Four Tet's instrumentals. So it's doubly frustrating when the end of each track cuts off abruptly and the editing becomes obvious. On other songs, however, the processes set in motion seem beyond human control. The last, ""The Hard Way We Go,"" reverberates like the steady march of an army of ants to the surface. Maybe all of these autonomous rhythms provide a hint as to why Christensen chose to record under the name Western Automatic. It's harder to see why so many critics panned It's 1995 as aural wallpaper, but it's clear the title refers to a time when electronica first started receiving widespread recognition, and it's not difficult to involve yourself in the steady sound of this album's floral awakening.","Some people just can't appreciate good ambient music.

Odd Job Discrimination EP,Phoenecia,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05aea9e61561daa454e/1:1/w_160/e296ea0b.gif,2001-11-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6270-odd-job-discrimination-ep/,Schematic,"This is the third EP of Odd Job remixes by Miami IDM duo (and Schematic label headz) Phoenecia, the last two appearing in '99. A dark electro track bearing that title appeared on their debut, Brownout, but the two previous Odd Job EPs predated that album, and I can hear only traces of the track on these six reworkings. Phoenecia may be fucking with my head with this cryptic discographical smokescreen, but I can deal: this EP is sweet. The kickoff flies through the uprights courtesy of Matmos, who dance the Garo Yepremian all over the characteristically dense and funky ""The Climatic Battle Scene Between Rom & Josh Version."" The tune starts in Buck Rogers mode, tossing lasers, snarling drums and voices together like the Egyptian Lover upgraded to 32 bits. A third of the way in, live drums overwhelm the song and then trail off into polyrhythmic drum programming and a deep thicket of textured effects. Someone or something called Adult comes next, with a nostalgic electro trip fit for Rephlex called ""Compurythm Version"" that incorporates the new wave ""Me and My Rhythm Box"" from 80s cult film Liquid Sky. The primitive keyboards and drum pads benefit from a 21st century sensibility, and the track is nothing short of killer. Dino Felipe slows things down for the abstractly pretty ""Sun Deck Version,"" which has the flavor of the studied silliness that used to flow like Riesling from the A-Musik compound. Prefuse 73's ""Ramen Noodle Version"" is very much of a piece with Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, with steady rolling beats, warm organ chords, and tiny fragments of rap tossed in the air like confetti. Otto Von Schirach gets a bit showy with his DSP tricks on ""Tre Deuce Ave. Smash & Grab Version,"" but he redeems himself with a hypnotic 808 bass hook and a complex beat that remains danceable. Closing out this 30-minute set, Jeswa's ""Dreamlike Steak Version"" improves on the gauzy electronoir ambience of Autechre's ""Amber."" (I was never crazy about that Ae record, though I know it is loved by many.) Whatever the actual sound files used to create Odd Job Discrimination, to my mind this is the perfect remix record-- short, punchy and great to listen to in one sitting. Though they remain in the armchair camp, Phoenecia's style of IDM gives much respect to the floor-filling rhythm. Most of the tracks on Odd Job Discrimination play up the latter quality, imparting a welcome sense of fun.

Ten New Songs,Leonard Cohen,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60f5e6ef95969320c4a/1:1/w_160/9c390b51.jpg,2001-11-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1527-ten-new-songs/,Columbia,"I should get one thing out of the way before this review gets too long: Leonard Cohen's charm, for me, lies mostly in his words and the way he says them. This is perhaps something he picked up from the poets, or maybe imbedded from his years as a writer, before he ever recorded a note. It's not that his music is easily dismissed, or even that his legacy isn't being closely guarded by dark, genius songwriters hidden somewhere in the corners between Bob Dylan, Nick Drake and probably anyone worth their ink everywhere. Cohen's music is often the coolest part about what never immediately strikes me with his songs. It's just always seemed a little secondary to his words. It could be that you just don't write phrases like, ""May the lights in the Land of Plenty/ Shine on the truth someday,"" when making catchy tunes is your primary objective. It seems to me Cohen's songs come more from a hope that he'll hit on an answer, or maybe if he's feeling generous, that he would be able translate some of the truth he already understands, more than from any kind of songwriting tradition. I just read he was in a Buddhist monastery for the last few years. His new words could be more prophetic than usual, or maybe just a little morbid, in the most humane way possible. But they're his, and I suppose even the best people are obliged to listen. Ten New Songs is Cohen's first release of new material since 1992's The Future. He often finds a partner to share the weight (usually on the musical end), and this time he's found Sharon Robinson. Robinson (best known as a session vocalist, and pop songwriter), while certainly leaving her stamp on the proceedings as producer, arranger, performer, and co-writer on every tune, hasn't muffled Cohen's artistic voice any more than his previous collaborators. Of course, her kind of soft rock-- closer to ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" by Foreigner than I'm comfortable with-- probably isn't going to score many points with the indie crowd, but it's not going to throw off your concentration for very long. Tunes like ""In My Secret Life"" and ""Alexandra Leaving"" actually end up in a far more soulful world because of Robinson than if they had been purely Cohen efforts. These tunes, with Cohen's immensely weighty vocal, lower and possibly darker than ever before, shine with a peculiar optimism even as they betray his resolve with just about every corporeal sensation imaginable. And his passion is still there: ""I'd die for the truth/ In my secret life,"" he sings in the opening track, and where there's a marked distaste for the material world all over the album, he still admits to buying ""what I'm told"" just like any other conditioned consumer species. Maybe it's indecision, or maybe it's a realization of the hopelessness of running against the grain, but Cohen never stops to consider his own insights or stoop to self-pity. Or, maybe I'm missing his point entirely. He's such a good writer that I wouldn't feel bad for having heard him speak/sing the stuff. Elsewhere, though Robinson's slick backdrop relentlessly attempts to disguise it, Cohen unleashes harsher demons. In ""By the Rivers Dark,"" he admits the constant threat to spirituality (in whatever form) in the modern world: ""And I did forget/ My holy song/ And I had no strength in Babylon."" And, per his willingness to let it be, ""By the rivers dark/ Where it all goes on/ By the rivers dark in Babylon."" There are perhaps correlations I could make to Cohen's recent immersion in Buddhism, and its doctrines of allowing one's self to flow with the river of life and to accept that we simply cannot know what we are not. But the truth is, Cohen has always been as perceptive, and has found his way seemingly by a mix of keen insight and passive discovery. There are moments where I wonder if he hasn't gone over the edge into helplessness, letting his inner conflicts have their way with him. ""Boogie Street"" (I know, terrible title, and let me say that Robinson's uber-lame Skin-emax sex scene atmospherics don't exactly do the tune any favors) opens with a joyful reunion with the ""Darkened One."" ""A sip of wine, a cigarette,"" and Cohen's ready to take a trip to other side, meeting any number of transient pleasures on an avenue where ""all the maps of blood and flesh are posted on the door."" And the song never brings you back to the safe neighborhoods. Maybe this isn't the kind of thing that goes over well as a conversation piece, and if I had one request, it would be to listen to the album after a shot of something very hard (but very smooth), and just take it in alone. The album ends with ""The Land of Plenty,"" and suitably, Cohen picks the last song to raise the layered curtain a little. The tenth new song features reminders of forgotten promises (""I know I said I'd meet you... I can't buy it anymore"") and faiths long since given up (""For the Christ who has not risen""), but then it lets me down gently. He says, ""May the lights in the land of plenty shine on the truth some day."" And this is where I remember why I listen to him: Cohen says these words as if he heard them on top of a mountain. Maybe he heard them from some Zen master who doesn't have to live in our world, and must have realized their meaning while meditating, transcended from pain, but soaked in wisdom. But this is not where the words came from; Cohen said them, and he wrote them, and whether it's nice music or just amazing prose, I can only tell you what I heard.","I should get one thing out of the way before this review gets too long: Leonard Cohen's charm, for ...

,Triangle,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a807c0084474cd0c0d2b/1:1/w_160/dd1e166f.gif,2001-11-01 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8150-triangle/,File-13,"In the fringes of obscurity, a new battle will be fought between a Danish ""alternative"" band named Triangle, and this Minneapolis synth-pop duo. It's as if Mr. Fantastic fought Plasticman in a Marvel/DC crossover issue. And that's not even getting into the kind of triangular quarrel that could ensue if the avant-rock duo, Triangles, were introduced. Though I've not listened to their music, I'm betting on the Danes. Vikings make such beautiful melodies. The real question is, which Triangle has the better lawyer, and will either band climb to any level of prominence where a lawsuit could have a foreseeable point? Again, I'm betting on Triangle DK. The debut record by Triangle US, the moronically titled ***, is pretty dismissable stuff. Acoustic and hyper-clean electric guitars jangle under squirting synths, as some art school grads chirp pretentious lyrics of no consequence. There's nothing egregiously wrong with the music itself-- it's just your average, typically mediocre Pro Tools pop with beats as crisp and thin as the crackers at a low-budget wine and cheese party. What really sinks ***, though, is the singing. The second Amanda Warner opens her reedy little throat on the first track, ""The Results,"" the show's over. Her voice is flat, with a halfhearted hitch and no emotional delivery. But wait! She's soon joined by the other 1\xBD sides of the Triangle, Brian Tester. His voice is mildly nasal, mildly ironic, and in general, mild. Though similar in their flatness, neither singer's voice blends with the other. The vocals intertwine and trade off with zero chemistry, almost as if completely oblivious to the fact that there's another person singing. ""8:26 a.m.,"" probably the ""best"" of these tracks, explores a bit of an Afro-pop sound, with some bongos and shiny, clean guitar lines. If only it didn't sound like Peter Gabriel. When your third-world cultural exploration ends up sounding like an old British guy, you're on to nothing. There's a springy ""booooiiiing"" sound, too. (Never a good sign.) The album continues along, usually fading into white noise rather than actively irritating. If you're like me, you'll have to keep listening to it so you can vaguely describe what it sounds like. But chances are, you'll never have to listen to it, ever. Keep your fingers crossed. But enough about ***. Let's get back to that battle between Mr. Fantastic and Plasticman: ""Look out, Mr. Fantastic! He's stretching!"" ""You can stretch all you want, Plasticman. You're no match for my stretching powers!"" ""Oh, yeah, Mr. Fantastic? Well, stretch your way out of this!"" ""Pretty stretchy, Plasticman, but watch out for my super-stretch!"" ""Oh yeah?

Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward,The Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-la-la Band,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40a5e6ef9596932079f/1:1/w_160/f5986243.jpg,2001-11-01 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7166-born-into-trouble-as-the-sparks-fly-upward/,Constellation,"Some things in life are inevitable. According to my friend Joel Bogorad, even Bogorad is inevitable. Nothing Bogorad says or does is a matter of his choice, and nothing he will do can be altered or prevented. Bogorad's final chapter is already written, even though he has yet to find out the ending. Believe Bogorad, and you share the same fate. After all, Bogorad is a determinist-- he believes that every choice he makes is determined by prior experiences, dating back to before his birth. Because he can do nothing to change those experiences, he has absolutely no choice in his future. It will happen, and he won't have a thing to do with it. How Bogorad sleeps, I don't know. Silver Mt. Zion are likewise pledged to the inevitable. According to members of the Canadian collective, the demise of humanity is as inevitable as Bogorad himself. Globalization, the prison industrial complex and ""terminal economies of blood,"" are processes and entities on an irreversible course toward ruin. Efrim, Sophie, Thierry, Beckie, Ian and Jessica have no illusions of changing fate; they simply aim for virtue. The music of Silver Mt. Zion embodies that worldview. They're clearly not competing for listeners. If they are, they're doing everything wrong-- no catchy melodies, no hooks, no guitar solos, no cleavage. And I dare you to mass produce their packaging (all cardboard, a full page of anti-capitalist calligraphy, and, oh yeah, a picture of an old guy trying to revive a dead person. Nice). No, the goal is not popular stardom, or even acceptance. Rather, it's musical integrity; to create gorgeous music without regard for convention. Furthermore, as fans of Silver Mt. Zion (and their foster-parents, Godspeed You Black Emperor!) have come to appreciate, their sullen, brooding arrangements could do as much to communicate the ruin of humanity as ten Efrim interviews. Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward is a regally ambitious album, even by this band's standards. Even so, you wouldn't know it from the first two tracks. The opening composition, ""Sisters! Brothers! Small Boats are Falling from the Sky!"" is updated chamber music, opening with a percussive echo that gives way to a simple, four-note string arrangement. Both yield as a mournful piano melody enters, complemented by chamber strings and the faint buzz-wail of manipulated tape. The song builds strength, but never reaches crescendo, leaving the listener to cope with unresolved sadness. ""This Gentle Hearts Like Shot Bird's Fallen"" employs similar dynamics, moving from the concocted chirps and echoes to a disquieted string theme. The problem in striving for high art is that sometimes pretentiousness, like Bogorad, is also inevitable. The members of Silver Mt. Zion have always flirted with pretentiousness, but in most cases, they've remained clearly on the side of profundity. Unfortunately, the flirting on prior albums and projects has developed into a full-borne crush. For example, the monologue on ""Built Then Burnt (Hurrah! Hurrah!)"" is unbearably amateurish, delivered by either a bad child actor, or a bad adult actor doing a child's voice. As bad as the monologue is, the swarm of whiny, multi-tracked voices on the tense, grating ""Take These Hands and Throw Them in the River"" is worse. ""Worse,"" as in, it reminded me of the Scorpions (yes, those Scorpions). The vocals on this track-- performed by the band's Constellation Records labelmate Frankie Sparo-- aren't far removed from the gritty operatics of front-Scorpion Klaus Meine, and they're delivered with all the false melodrama of Queensryche. After this, however, Silver Mt. Zion returns to form, following the compellingly distraught ""Could've Moved Mountains"" with the soundtrack-ish (albeit slightly boring) ""Tho You Are Gone I Still Often Walk w/You."" The most dynamic selection on Born into Trouble, and its only real rock number, is ""C'mon Come On (Loose an Endless Longing),"" which-- after building into noise-- fades into formless ambience, then returns to rock with a completely indulgent and entirely satisfying overblown full-band catharsis. The closing number stands out, as well, because it's actually a ""song,"" and because it isn't nearly as depressing as the rest of the album. But they do sing about guns, cancer, barricades, ""losing your way,"" and shit like that, so what do I know? It sounds kind of pretty. I'll stand by this band-- they're still too good to be true. But, like the rest of us ignorant, inevitable human beings, Silver Mt. Zion occasionally slips. Here, the slips are noticeable, and the formula wears a little thin, but for the most part, Born into Trouble remains an intense and engaging album.",,7.7,
Kekeland,Brigitte Fontaine,by: Andi Rowlands,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf113d197565213b666/1:1/w_160/37fd023b.jpg,2001-11-01 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3143-kekeland/,Virgin,"With the recent rebirth of Paris and its arts, French artists and celebrities have been showing up everywhere. In fashion, all the youth energy is carried on in Paris with Nicolas Ghesquiere, Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs, and Stella McCartney, among others, all calling the city their own. French cinema is also getting over its dry spell with a new Charlotte Gainsbourg film in the works, as well as American actresses like Chloë Sevigny working there now. French music has found a fanbase in America, with Daft Punk and Air becoming nigh-household names. In past years most popular things in Paris were imported from America or other countries. But this new excitement is purely French, a celebration of their country. It's almost patriotic. So, with all of this going on, what does one of France's living legends spend her time doing? Well, if you're Brigitte Fontaine, you call up long-time partner Areski, as well as Jim O'Rourke, Sonic Youth, Noir Desir, and Dave Pajo to help make the most colorful record of your career (complete with Eiffel towers amid the cover art and minimal English). Brigitte's music has always been varied and eclectic, ranging from the semi-traditional (albeit quirky) French-pop orchestrations of her 1970 debut, Brigitte Fontaine Est..., through her work with the Art Ensemble of Chicago; from her early a capella work with Areski to their later psychedelic Moog experiments in the late 70s. 1997's Les Palaces showed a more electronic sound, similar to Stereolab's Dots and Loops of that time. But as vast as her sounds were, each album remained similar in tone. That's what makes Kekeland so exciting-- each song is an entirely different style. Such a vast mix of sounds can get confusing, but the record never sounds strained or forced, and manages to achieve a nice flow throughout. ""Demie Clocharde"" opens the album with a low-key SYR-sound, but is soon broken up by a decidedly simple and clean piano line. After a while, the piano morphs into a keyboard and then back. The next track, ""Bis Baby Boum Boum"" could pass as Limp Bizkit, with Areski passing as a vastly superior Fred Durst and Brigitte pulling out her best Patty Waters scream. ""Pipeau"" has a great Blondie/Clash reggae vibe to it and ""Je T'aime Encore"" sounds like a long-lost Kurt Weill song that Marianne Faithfull couldn't handle. ""God's Nightmare"" sounds like a perfect single, complete with dance-pop hooks galore, and ""Guadalquivir"" tries on Spanish flamenco. ""Les Filles D'Aujuord'hui"" has the traditional, pretty Jane Birkin-ish keyboard lines which reflect the source of French music that's been expanded upon with this release. It brings you back to the Paris of baguettes and red lipstick, of berets and cigarettes. Kekeland is the perfect accompaniment to this worldwide rediscovery of Paris as a source of art. Like all good memories and tributes, it salutes the past while looking to the future. And who better to take us there than Brigitte Fontaine? As she makes known in the title track, ""You know I am the queen, the queen of Kekeland."" Yes, Mme. Fontaine, Nico and Yoko Ono still have nothing on you.","With the recent rebirth of Paris and its arts, French artists and celebrities\n\ have been showing up everywhere. In ...

Please Smile My Noise Bleed,Múm,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40e13d197565213be82/1:1/w_160/5b503f11.gif,2001-11-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5503-please-smile-my-noise-bleed/,Morr,"Here's the setup: Icelandic foursome, described on their record label's website as ""painfully ordinary kids from a middle class background,"" hand over two new tracks to Germany's Thomas Morr, proprietor of underground electronic phenom Morr Music. The two original tracks, as well one brief reprise, do not stray far from Múm's pastoral electronics as instated on this year's stunning Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today is OK. Morr passes the tracks off to some of his finest tweakers: Styrofoam, Isan, Phonem, Christian Kleine, Arovane, and B. Fleischmann. Result: forty-five more minutes of electronic bliss. Please Smile My Noise Bleed works much like a film soundtrack, with its first two cuts, ""On the Old Mountain Radio"" and ""Please Sing My Spring Reverb,"" setting the themes that will be reiterated throughout. (The rest of the album consists of remixes of these two.) While the basic elements present on these new tracks-- diced voices, schizophrenic clicks, light music-box-like synths-- aren't particularly neoteric, their melodies, rather than the sounds themselves, are repeatedly reconstructed as the album's centerpiece. This isn't to say that the timbre of the instruments on these opening two tracks should be disregarded, but the purity of the near-sine-wave tones promotes the clarity of their melodies. While the remixers tend to lose this mentality, they generally preserve the idyllic atmosphere proposed by the originals. Isan's ""Catena Mix"" of ""Please Sing My Spring Reverb"" distorts and echoes the melody while adding an overdrive to the drum track. Christian Kleine's ""Sole Mix"" of ""On the Old Mountain Radio"" replaces the simple schizophrenic clicks with an elementary drum machine track that longs to sound acoustic, but ultimately, with its airy hi-hat and wisps, falls nearer to Aphex Twin. In fact, the tendency for many of these remixes is to replace the focus of the melody with percussive elements. As a result, a sense of movement that's absent in the originals-- which appear more or less sedentarily contemplative-- is instilled. But even with Múm's melodic base taking the passenger seat, the movement created is anything but turbulent. What's most intriguing is how well this record actually works as a whole. This can partially be attributed to the 1\xBD-minute interlude, ""Flow Not So Fast My Old Mountain Radio,"" which reaches for something completely different with accelerated and interlocked synth arpeggios. The melodic lines resemble harps, but the synth remains in no-attack, sine-wave airspace. This track aside, the theme and variation scheme does hinder some elements, but it never approaches tedium. In fact, five of the six remixes are of ""Please Sing My Spring Reverb,"" and the vitality of the theme never wanes. The work of the remixers is also balanced in the opposite sense so that there's a sense of coherency that defies the tracks sounding disparate. One gets the feeling that the remixers respected the intentions of the originals enough to retain them in their own versions. The album closes with Bernard Fleischmann's outstanding mix of ""Spring Reverb,"" which approaches organic sound in a way most of these other tracks don't. It begins with voices extracted from near the end of the original, but by being left untreated, they become stark in contrast to the static Fleischmann throws in every few measures. Much of the original's tinkling bell melodies are removed, and the drums are brought up to support the voice. Eventually, the mix collapses into an amalgam of looped voices, creating an eerie yet moving effect before it glitches jerkily into a complete stop. Noise Bleed begins and ends with manipulated human voices, reflecting that Múm demonstrate the ability to alter the spectrum of fabricated electronic sound in a natural way that resembles direct expression. These remixes, while rarely true to the originals in a natural sense, manage to maintain this humanity for the most part, and in some cases, magnify it. It's a testament not only to the talent of Morr Music's roster, but also to the rapid evolution of electronics.","Here's the setup: Icelandic foursome, described on their record label's website\n\ as ""painfully ordinary kids from a ...

Getaway,The Clean,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ecc0084474cd0c082e/1:1/w_160/478b92b2.jpg,2001-10-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1493-getaway/,Merge,"A few months ago, in a particularly slothful state on a Thursday evening, I sat down and watched about five straight hours of documentaries on PBS. Now, I love documentaries-- I'm getting to the point where I think I like them more than fictional films-- but to sit around for that long and just watch TV is pretty unusual for me. I probably would have gone and done something else after the first documentary (a fascinating look at America's scenic waterways) had the second one not been about New Zealand. Now, I confess that I knew next to nothing about that quarter of the world outside of the WWII era, so a documentary on New Zealand's history piqued my interest immediately. To make a long story short, it was one of those stories that makes you feel guilty for being of European descent. But the country itself really is fascinating. Did you know that sheep outnumber people nearly 20 to 1 there? That's a lot of sheep! Or not a lot of people, as the case seems to be. I also find it amusing that the country's air force logo is a kiwi, a bird that can't even fly. Anyway, New Zealand, like its big neighbor across the Tasman Sea, Australia, has managed to develop a unique culture of its own since separating from the British Empire last century. And, also like Australia, New Zealand has developed a fairly singular, identifiable music scene of its own. The New Zealand Sound, if it can be said to exist, usually laces rhythmic post-punk with a heavy acid tab of psychedelia, and few bands can be said to embody it as well as the Clean. This seems logical, of course, as the Clean were one of the first bands with that sound. Upon their formation in 1978, they were one of the few New Zealand bands playing strictly their own material, and they were to prove hugely influential in their homeland despite their limited recorded output. Indeed, they didn't record their first full-length album, Vehicle, until 1990, after reuniting. Since then, the Clean has been an on-again, off-again prospect, with the three members coming away from their other projects every so often to record an album or tour. Listening to Getaway-- only the band's fourth proper album over the course of 23 years-- is enough to make me wish they'd stay together more often. To be clear, let's first assert that Getaway isn't really an especially innovative or earth-shattering record. Neither, however, is it a typical recording for a middle-aged band, content to simply tread the same old path without turning over any new rocks to see what's underneath. In fact, Getaway sounds remarkably youthful, split between brief, upbeat rockers, and longer, more meditative swaths of noisy psych. The album opens with ""Stars,"" which is something of a middle ground between the two extremes. It's full of droning distortion and restrained rhythm section playing, but also throws some enticing vocals hooks into the mix, delivered in David Kilgour's laid-back vocal style. ""Jala"" follows, steering the tone toward trance-inducing psychedelia with its alternate guitar tunings, thrummed piano strings, pitched percussion, and droning, wah'd guitar parts. This strategy is returned to several times over the course of the album, most notably on ""Alpine Madness"" and ""Circle Canyon,"" both of which feature Yo La Tengo's Georgia Hubley and Ira Kaplan. ""Alpine Madness,"" in particular, has the pentatonic mantra thing going-- it's sort of like the Byrds' ""Mind Gardens,"" except that David Crosby isn't singing out of tune on top of it, and therefore, it doesn't absolutely suck. ""Circle Canyon"" continues in the same vein, but ushers in percussion and sets you up for the album's mightiest track, ""Aho."" ""Aho"" begins with some of David Kilgour's signature bluesy, wah'd guitar backed by brother Hamish's ultra-dark cymbals, before Robert Scott's melodic bassline starts grooving like hell and the whole band launches into a crazy jam. Kilgour's vocals reside near the middle of the mix, sharing space with his guitar, and often forgoing lyrics completely for spontaneous adlibing. The band also makes excellent use of stereo panning, setting the scratchy, muted guitar in the left speaker and the harmonic parts in the right, which makes headphone listening that much more rewarding. The album's shorter pieces come basically in two varieties: short, tuneful instrumentals like ""Cell Block No. 5""(which features some nice sax parts) and ""Holdin' On,"" and sharply penned songs like ""Poor Boy,"" which would make a fine single. Dense, heavily layered guitar parts like the ones on this album can have a tendency to drown otherwise good melodies, but that's generally avoided here, as the band seems to have a pretty good sense for what the audience needs to hear. Taken as a whole, Getaway is a fine record from a band of seasoned veterans. Old fans are almost certainly going to be thrilled with this, and I wouldn't be surprised if a few new ones climbed aboard. If there's any complaint you could level at the Clean at this stage in their career, it's that occasionally they'll find themselves wandering without much purpose, but in wandering, they usually end up someplace intriguing rather quickly. Once the album's over, all there is left to do is hope that they hurry out with the next one.","A few months ago, in a particularly slothful state on a Thursday evening, I sat down and watched about five ...

Home Burns,Orange Can,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ed9d034d5c69bf532c/1:1/w_160/cc2b5119.jpg,2001-10-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6018-home-burns/,Regal,"Inbreeding isn't all bad. For one thing, it suffers from horrendous misconceptions. The fact is, inbreeding between first cousins risks only a 4-5% chance of birth defects, slightly less than double that of an ordinary child. Moreover, it preserves pedigree. Take canines, for example-- mate two purebreds from the same lineage and you're far more likely to win Best in Show. Humans preserve pedigree, too, as has occurred with royals for generations (including the current Royal House of Windsor) and, of course, my own parents. Orange Can are big on pedigree. Think of them as the Westminster-favorite Standard Poodle. The Standard Poodle wears its influences on the outside-- in fact, it's precisely because of the traits of its ancestors that the breeder ever chose to bring it into existence. The breeder hopes that the best traits from the dog's ancestors will commingle, binding the perfect genes in poodles for generations to come. The pitfall, however, is as patent as my six-fingered brother's cleft lip; if the two dogs both have the same genetic flaw (i.e. ""mutant allele"") the mix could result in a freaky genetic disorder, sometimes as innocuous as especially bad doggie-halitosis, and others as severe as premature death. So it is with London, England's Orange Can. They make psychedelic jam rock that draws almost exclusively-- and sometimes indistinguishably-- from their English ancestors. These ancestors include the following: Pink Floyd, the Beta Band, and the Stone Roses, among others. They also include American quasi-expatriates (half-breeds, mutts) like Jimi Hendrix. First off, the positive traits. Orange Can is clearly from the same litter as its Regal UK labelmates, the Beta Band. They've inherited a very similar approach to song structure, featuring mellow, bass-heavy, psychedelic jams. ""Shoot the Morning Sun"" bears that out with sparse, organic percussion (shakers, hand-claps, bass drum), a wandering pentatonic bassline, and singer Jason Aslett's lax vocal delivery. ""Mornin' Sun,"" easily the most enjoyable track on Home Burns, employs similar orchestration, but builds energy into a foot-stomping, full-band R&B; chorus reminiscent of Spiritualized. Similar kudos go to musicality and production. Guitarist James Aslett borrows heavily from the Hendrix-inflected tones of the Stone Roses, in addition to the Voodoo Child himself. Bassist Lee Caitlin proves from the opening boogie of ""In Your Shoes"" that he has the chops and versatility to give both the blues and prog-rock numbers convincing authenticity. On the production end, Home Burns almost sounds like a period piece; from the eight-track dirtiness and reverbed harmonica of ""Crybaby,"" to the myriad vintage guitar effects, the songs flow together with consistency, in spite of their diverse influences. On the other side of Orange Can's musical consanguinity lies its detrimental mutant alleles. An influence apparent on many tracks is Pink Floyd. ""Down Where She Lays"" opens with a taste of frenetic 70s prog-rock riffing (bass-driven, 5/4 time), then relaxes into a morose jam highlighted by trippy guitar embellishments. ""Ransom"" is another Pink Floyd tribute. Singer Jason Aslett adds lethargic vocals over a languid arrangement consisting of simple drums and bass which are eventually joined by a soul-free horn arrangement. I never really enjoyed Pink Floyd, and Orange Can has successfully reminded me why: the dull, stagnant jams sound indifferent and unambitious. And what's worse, unlike Pink Floyd, Orange Can can't even claim groundbreaker status. When they suck, it's all derivative-- almost like they chose to suck on purpose. That said, however, if you're into trippy, nebulous jamming a la Roger Waters and friends, you may really enjoy even the weaker tunes on Home Burns. Also, the prog-rocking can occasionally be quite engaging, as on the shifty, soulful ""Only 15,"" which recalls both King Crimson and the Stone Roses... and Pink Floyd. All in all, Orange Can is an imperfect poodle. The breeders might want to try a new mix next time; grab a horny German Shepherd, or a nice looking Chihuahua. Something fresh might help Orange Can retain their strengths as musicians, while developing their own voice and avoiding blandness.","Inbreeding isn't all bad.

Once We Were Trees,Beachwood Sparks,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23913d1975652138805/1:1/w_160/591e2f5a.gif,2001-10-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/598-once-we-were-trees/,Sub Pop,"The good, the bad, the ugly and the twee: psychedelic pop is back, and who could have foreseen it? Bands that might've been dabbling in electronics five years ago, or maybe taking a stab at incorporating a few choreographed dance moves into their act are now chucking their drum machines for four-track recorders and flange pedals. It's a movement, baby, and if you're hip enough, you can get in on the ground floor! And hey, truth be told, it's not like the stuff has a chance in hell of being popular, so you don't have to worry about someone stealing your scene, and... whoa, hold up. You mean this isn't the next big fad? That puts a damper on me. You see, the thing about the original psych-pop was that it wasn't designed for the long haul. Kids would form a band in high school, play some Them covers, and be happy that the prom gig wasn't booked yet. Then, the bass player would fall into some acid, communicate the disease to his friends, and the next thing we knew, Jerry Garcia's considered one of the best guitarists of all time. Well, maybe it wasn't exactly like that, but after hearing enough Electric Prunes records, I'm wondering if the psychedelic era may have been hiccup in time rather than an actual musical movement. Perhaps bands like Beachwood Sparks get around the rather stifling, sub-genre dead end by making sure their homages to old-schoolers like Gram Parsons and the Byrds are spot-on, and not devoid of actual songwriting. To be fair, the band isn't going straight for the paisley, instead opting for cosmically affected country-pop, deep down fairly straightforwardly. And to be even fairer, this is something they have in common with bands like the Byrds, so when in doubt, give them the benefit. Once We Were Trees is their second album. Let's listen in. After a short instrumental prologue (""Germination""), things begin in earnest with ""Confusion is Nothing New."" Running down the checklist, I hear an echo-treated mix (maybe a result of the production work of partner-in-crime, J. Mascis), drawn-out, lazily enunciated phrasing, slide guitar beamed in from Saturn, drone matching twang jab for jab-- yeah, it sounds like hippie music. But it's got a good hook and nice vocal harmonies, and you could do a lot worse trying to drum up sunny music for the picnic. I can't understand anything they're saying, except for someone telling me not to ""give in to the things that take away from you,"" so maybe I should add inspirational freewill philosophies to the agenda. This leads to the down-home white funk of ""Sun Surrounds Me,"" and more nasal soul than you could find on anyone to the right of John Sebastian. But again, it's got a hook that makes you shake things, and the harmonies are cool. In fact, the subtle details like the Hammond organ licks and unexpected freaky coda are so idiomatic I wonder if this stuff isn't more academic than innocuous. Bah, I won't bring up any critical bad vibes here. Of course, there's a Sade cover (""By Your Side""), though I think Beachwood Sparks have a better handle on sly retro-hipness than she does, and therefore shouldn't need to perform ironic cover songs to be cool. It does sound nice (one of their better modes, as far as I can tell), in a ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" kind of way, and it's possible that the band simply liked the song, and wanted to play it just because. Rock critics don't handle sincerity very well, so I'll leave you with my suspicion that they were only trying to make waves on indie playlists with this, and by doing so could inadvertently cement their gimmick-band status. Bah, the bad vibes again! Joking aside, I do think bands that know something about the history of their music are rare enough, and I admire Beachwood Sparks just on principal. Throughout the album, it's obvious just how many old records they must have listened to, and it does take a certain love of life to work this hard bringing those sounds into the 21st century. As the album ends, drenched in the fuzzback of fantastically hirsute trash-rock (featuring an even more fantastic noisy guitar solo), I can start to forgive the similarities the band has with its forefathers. When I take into account that 1) there are actual songs here, not just parodies, and 2) most of the tunes were fun to listen to, I remember that playing rock-- psychedelic, trashy or otherwise-- doesn't have to be an exercise in originality. Maybe, it just has to be a way to pass the time. Nothing more required on a good day for a light jam and a daydream.","The good, the bad, the ugly and the twee: psychedelic pop is back, and who could have foreseen it? Bands ...

Used Songs: 1973-1980,Tom Waits,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9bbb1335d7bf1699534/1:1/w_160/9989b2df.jpg,2001-10-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8561-used-songs-1973-1980/,ElektraRhino,"So, here's the question: how do you go from James Taylor comparisons to being mentioned in the same breath as weirdos Harry Partch, Captain Beefheart and William S. Burroughs? And the answer is: I don't know. Ask Tom Waits. He'd probably tip his hat back, mumble some lengthy convoluted story about how he was born in the back of a cab, and go straight into how he was hired for his first paying gig based solely on the shoes he was wearing. After which, he'll most likely break into a wide, toothy grin, scoop up some confetti from his coat pocket and sprinkle it over his head before he vanishes in a cloud of sawdust and smoke. Back before his days as demented carnival barker and the macabre stories of butchers, German dwarves and the Eyeball Kid, Tom Waits was plying his craft as a gravel voiced faux-beat singer plink-plonking his way around a piano and writing songs about hookers, hobos and gangsters. Come to think of it, Waits has been dancing around the same ideas, updating variations on the same characters in his own twisted, offbeat mythologies since the mid-70s. It's just that when 1983 and Swordfishtrombones rolled around the songs transformed into something much more carnival-esque, while the music drifted into the sphere of Partch-like percussion and disjointed guitar riffs. Up to that point, he'd (for the most part) been working with mainly conventional melodies and dipping his fingers into folk, rock and jazz. During that early time, he had a musical persona that was street-smart swagger mixed with affection for all the losers and down-and-outs. Throughout three decades of writing songs, he's always been in touch with society's seedy underbelly, reserving a place in his songs for the downtrodden and the beat. Whether you belong to an underground civilization of dwarves or you're a down-on-his-luck bum sitting in a puddle of rain, you've got a place in Waits' world. What with the drastic musical makeover and label jump in the 80s, a distinctive line was drawn between the later work and the 70s stuff. Ask pretty much any longtime Waits fan what their favorite album is and they might just give you two: one from his early drunken-lounge-singer years and one from his post-1983-metamorphosis into ghoulish Vaudevillian ringleader. All this shifting and change makes it frustratingly impossible to put together a career-spanning single disc retrospective, so what Rhino and Mr. Waits have put together instead is a hodgepodge of tracks from the Elektra/Asylum years. Enough with the introduction, then. Let's get to the meat of the matter. What's the track selection like? Are there rarities? Outtakes and demos? Live obscurities? Well, as the title suggests, Used Songs is an assortment of 16 tracks spanning from Waits' first album, Closing Time, to 1980's Heartattack and Vine. Everything that's to be had here is available on the official releases from the period and much of it's been collected previously on two separate anthologies. So everyone out there holding their breath for unreleased tracks and live-only gems like ""Hokey Pokey"" and ""Trash Day"" can keep their fingers crossed for next time. What's obvious on first glance at the song selection is the lack of very early material. Only three tracks from the first three albums appear, while the later albums often get three or four tracks apiece. ""Ol' 55,"" made famous by the Eagles, is the only track on here from Closing Time and it's drastically different than anything else, even though it might be the most recognizable to the Waits novice. It captures Waits in his early years, his voice still smooth, and the comparisons to James Taylor and the singer/songwriters of the period still apt. By the time he'd recorded the rambling small-town beauty of ""(Looking for) The Heart of Saturday Night"" Waits' voice was already exhibiting signs of the gravel voice that would become so signature to his later sound. The only live track available here is from Nighthawks at the Diner, the in-studio recording documenting Waits' inclination to rambling offbeat stories, which eventually segue into tracks like ""Eggs and Sausage (In a Cadillac with Susan Michelson)."" And then, somewhere around 1976, Waits found a new distinctive voice that blended the sprawling myths of American culture and city life with the poetry and swagger of beats like Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady. If you add to the mix his ability to turn a line, an offbeat sense of humor and an increasing musical vocabulary, the result was something completely enchanting. Tracks like the Elvis-inspired strut of ""Burma Shave"" or the heartbreaking pair ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis"" and ""Blue Valentines"" are windows into American life akin to the heartbreak, desolation and simple warmth of an Edward Hopper painting. In the jazz-poetry goof on the sleazy-salesman's ""Step Right Up,"" Waits spits out a sequence of hilarious one-liners: ""It gives you an erection/ It wins the election"" or ""Change your shorts/ Change your life/ Change your life/ Change into a nine-year old Hindu boy/ Get rid of your wife."" An odd inclusion here is the duet with Bette Midler, ""I Never Talk to Strangers,"" from 1977's Foreign Affairs. The track itself is a pretty standard jazz duet, with banter between the two singers exchanged throughout. Even though they're not included here, Waits went on to offer much more successful duets on record, with Crystal Gayle (an even odder choice?) on the soundtrack to One from the Heart. By the time Waits recorded his last album for Asylum in 1980 (Heartattack and Vine), rock was his primary musical influence and he'd almost abandoned the neo-beat persona completely. Bruce Springsteen would later take the sha-la-la's and tenderness of ""Jersey Girl"" and turn them into a hit. Notice the trend in artists turning Waits-penned tunes into hits. ""Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)"" closes the disc. Taken from 1976's Small Change, it's the perfect closer to the album and, in my opinion, the best track available here. A downtrodden tale full of woe and misfortune, it's one of those tracks that puts you right on the barstool, fifth beer in front of you-- a portrait of loneliness and bleakness. It's a harrowing romance from probably the greatest album of Waits' early years, which brings me to my problem with the collection. Small Change is sadly under-represented here, with only the amazing ""Step Right Up"" and ""Tom Traubert's Blues"" on the roll call. So, my only complaint about this record is the questionable absence of the gorgeous ""Invitation to the Blues."" Other than that and some near-clunkers (""I Never Talk to Strangers""), Used Songs is an exceptional gathering of Waits' material. But I guess the question remains: is the compilation worth the investment? Well, for Waits beginners, this and the recently compiled Beautiful Maladies are perfect launching points into both eras of his career. Sadly, these are only temporary fixes. It'll just make most people clamber for albums like Small Change and Blue Valentines or Rain Dogs and Bone Machine. But, for me and fellow collector scum, sets like this serve as additions to a completists' collection. Finally, though, these two anthologies make it painfully obvious that if anyone at all deserves the box set treatment (outtakes, demos, live cuts and unreleased nuggets like ""Alice""), Mr. Waits is easily the number one contender.","So, here's the question: how do you go from James Taylor comparisons to being mentioned in the same breath ...

Bosco and Jorge,Bosco and Jorge,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a356c0084474cd0c0250/1:1/w_160/3520b734.gif,2001-10-30 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/873-bosco-and-jorge/,Explain,"I know what you're thinking: Bosco and Jorge are some new experimental ventriloquism act. Or maybe a revivalist vaudevillian comedy duo. Or possibly a Cheech and Chong cover band. But no. John Fahey casts a long, pitch-black shadow across the landscape of instrumental, finger-picked, steel-stringed acoustic guitar music from which few Guild-slingers can escape. And now that the man has passed away, expect a barrage of hero-worshipping imitators to try and fill his shoes. Needless to say, it ain't gonna happen. The nice thing about Chicago's Bosco and Jorge is that they seem to recognize this. They make no attempts to disguise their love for Fahey-- instead wearing it proudly like a badge-- and as ardent fans, they end up making something that rises slightly above a simple homage. Or in Oedipal terms: they try to kill the father by beating him at his own game. It makes sense that Bosco and Jorge (actually Bill Lowman and Brad Gallagher) met as kids at a concert of Fahey protegé Leo Kottke. But far from third-rate Fahey, Bosco and Jorge is actually better than anything Kottke's put out in a long time. It's even better than a lot of Fahey albums I've heard. There are other touchstones here, of course: Bert Jansch, Nick Drake, and Fahey influences like Skip James, Mississippi John Hurt, and Bill Monroe. And if you wear your hipster shades, you'll be able to discern the ghosts of these predecessors within the overwhelming Fahey glare reflecting off this album. For Bosco and Jorge, Fahey's best music was made from the mid-60s to the early 70s. They largely ignore his latter-day excursions into noise, and steer clear of his raga and Middle Eastern motifs, instead focusing on his Appalachian work. ""Sorta Play That Sorta Stuff,"" the lead-off track, sees the duo at their most imitative. Other instruments are added elsewhere, but here, they use only two guitars which begin on a mournful note before picking up speed and interlocking. Fahey's Requia springs immediately to mind. ""Two Steps Behind in the 1st Place"" follows, opening with a very somber and hushed guitar pattern before flutes soar in and flirt atop. If there's such a thing as autumnal samba, this is it. ""Mikey's Pole"" is the standout track. Bowed bass and cello provide the foundation for probably the most evocative guitar riff to be found here. Subtle but powerful, it uses harmonic taps in a way that isn't just mere claptrap-- a true rarity. Banjo takes the lead role for the first movement of the 11-minute ""Lil' Smokie."" A howling voice reminiscent of Tim Buckley (circa Lorca) soon takes over before returning to a halting and playful solo guitar interlude that builds to a frantic pace that would be sure to send Guitar World's readership to the Internet in search of tablature if they ever caught wind of it. The Fahey-isms return in full force with ""Niagara,"" as the two-guitar attack of the first track is resumed. But far from funereal, this piece is upbeat and vibrant. ""17 Year Cicada"" rounds out the album and comes closest to mapping out fresh musical territory, as Lowman and Gallagher branch out and add piano, drums, and an ever-so-slight touch of electric guitar that builds to a minor crescendo like a less bombastic Godspeed.","I know what you're thinking: Bosco and Jorge are some new experimental ventriloquism\n\ act.

Call and Response,Call and Response,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e7c0084474cd0c05bb/1:1/w_160/868c2c29.gif,2001-10-30 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1248-call-and-response/,Emperor Norton,"No, this isn't a rerun, but almost. Just months after their self-titled debut on Kindercore, sugary-sweet West coast popsters Call and Response have released essentially the same album on Emperor Norton. But before you can ask, ""Why is this necessary,"" let me explain that the album has two more songs on it this time around, and the songs have been re-sequenced for a smoother listening experience. Plus, nearly the whole shebang has been re-mixed by Mickey Petralia, who's probably best known for producing the Butthole Surfers' Electriclarryland and Beck's Midnite Vultures . Okay, now you can ask, ""Why is this necessary?"" Well, to be cynical, it's necessary because what was already ultra-catchy, bouncy, super-whitebread, honky-lips funk-pop has received an extra coat of gloss in a bid for a cameo spot on the upcoming season of ""Felicity"" or the next 80s retro flick starring Janeane Garofalo. And if that isn't enough for you, well, good. But to fair (and I have no idea if this is what they were gunning for, but I'm guessing no), this album is pretty depressing, precisely because it's so naively bright and rosy. You wish things were as great as this album makes them out to be-- that everything could be about ""Blowin' Bubbles,"" ""Rollerskating,"" and pre-disappointment school crushes. But those days are over, right? You're bruised and jaded now, and this reminder only comes as some sorta ironically perverse jab in the ribs. It reminds me of when, after years of sleeping in, I woke up early on a Saturday morning to watch cartoons, hoping to catch old friends like Foghorn Leghorn and Daffy Duck, only to find out they don't show cartoons on Saturday morning much anymore. They've all been replaced with teen soap-coms, the hideous bastard genre jumpstarted by Saved by the Bell. Oh, yeah, the album. If you happened to miss Call and Response the first time around, here's the gist of it: they're a five-piece whose calling card is slick boy/girl harmonies. Such dubious influences as the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas and the Papas, and the Archies offer a distinctly American slant to the Swed-core lineage of ABBA, Ace of Base, and most notably in Call and Response's case, Roxette and the Cardigans. Like most candy floss-pop, what's interesting here isn't the songs or the playing. It could be anyone (and probably is) playing anything. What's interesting is how a producer, engineer, or mixer can create a perfect machine for planting a melody firmly in your skull. And if that whole process is what gets you excited, here's twelve great subjects to dissect: two more than the original, and twice as sweet. Or maybe this will do the trick: ""You've got to know how to stop when you do the bunny hop,"" from ""Rollerskate."" What more can I say? The choice is obvious. You need both versions. Let your record collector geekdom take over. You'd do it for the Locust. ","No, this isn't a rerun, but almost.

Go Forth,Les Savy Fav,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce513d197565213b406/1:1/w_160/f59dbc53.jpg,2001-10-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4748-go-forth/,Frenchkiss,"I've been with Go Forth for one full week now. I mean that in the same sort of way you might say, with simpering pride or dull resignation, ""I've been with my girlfriend forever""; or, obstetrically speaking, ""I've been with child""; or even, congenitally speaking-- and best of luck to you-- ""I've been with spina bifida."" Thankfully, no one will be wed, dumped, birthed, or subjected to painful corrective spinal surgery as a result of this album. And yet, the week I've spent with it feels like months or years in album-time. An ordeal. With ordeals come the necessary shifting perspectives and vacillating opinions, which can be at turns violent and sudden, or geologically gradual in pace. My first session with Go Forth was marked by extreme interest, but tainted by slight disappointment. On subsequent listens, the disappointment gave way to total addiction. And, as tends to happen with addictions, I eventually burned out on these 12 songs and left them cold turkey. Predictably, though, I was soon back in their grip, if aware of their shortcomings. On ""Adoptuction,"" a hilarious ode to a Stockholm Syndrome dream, Tim Harrington sings, ""The haggling went on for days/ The days went on for weeks/ And weeks for years."" And so it went with my appraisal of this album. It's been a kind of bargaining process. I sat at one side of the table, lowballing the merit of the record in relation to 3/5, The Cat and the Cobra, and especially the sparkling Rome (Written Upside Down) EP. The album, however, wouldn't budge. And, like a seasoned junk-peddler at a bazaar hawking an obviously flawed but highly covetable art object, it edged me inch by inch until I was pretty damn near the original asking price. Pardon that goofy simile while I get on to some specifics. With indie mainstay Phil Ek producing, the RISD-born Brooklyn four-piece have assembled a maddeningly spacy, fairly inconsistent, but very rich set of songs that capitalize on the leftover space from guitarist Gibb Slife's departure. As it turns out, it's not quite on par with what last year's Rome EP promised, but it's also not without its virtues. ""Tragic Monsters"" is a beautiful opener, awash in whirring guitar lines and keyboard fuzz that become indistinguishable from one another. Harrington's lyrics are as droll, piquant, and fun as ever. His word games, as such, aren't exactly works of genius, and it seems a favorite past-time of some people to point this out. What I think those people fail to appreciate is how consistently Harrington is able to combine charming alliteration, funny turns of phrase, imagistically inventive scenarios, and thematic cohesion, and ply them all to the rhythmic demands of his more-often-than-not good-ass melodies. If you offhandedly disregard his lyrics because they seem silly and sophomoric, you're missing the big picture. ""Reprobate's Resume"" is strange, beginning with an odd introductory section that bears little relation to the song's main body. ""Blessed be the doctor/ And blessed be the nurse/ Blessed be the coachman/ Who put me in the hearse,"" spits Harrington over a skeletal drum and distorted guitar riff arrangement. The song's peak comes at the end, as its fading rock percussion yields to the dubby, echo-washed drum track of ""Crawling Can Be Beautiful."" ""Crawling"" reveals itself as pure late-70s British-- all Wire, Clash, and Gang of Four, yet distinctly Les Savy Fav: ""Who here finds this world distracting/ Who here finds this world a bore/ Who here thinks we're all play-acting/ And that the show's piss poor?"" Meanwhile, ""Disco Drive,"" which integrates electronics into the mix more convincingly than any of the prior songs, is the one track that could have easily come off the Rome EP. In the overall scheme of this album, though, it's just an aperitif for the absurdly catchy track that follows. ""The Slip"" takes telekinetic control of your ass like it was a gluteal remote control. Harrison Haynes' sick disco dance beat and Syd Butler's slippery bassline comprise what has to be one of the most immediately likeable moments of rock in the past five years. The sugar wears, as of course it must, but for the first few listens-- and probably all subsequent ones if you space them out reasonably-- this track will convince you of Les Savy Fav's singular role in today's sad state of rock. Of weird note is the fact that both ""Disco Drive"" and ""The Slip"" sound very much like late-80s the Cure, only substituting the insufferably plaintive Robert Smith with Harrington's frenetic wails. ""Daily Dares,"" though apparently serving some purpose in terms of track sequence, is on its own forgettable. Things get back to good on ""One to Three,"" though, a quirky ballad that's as much Pink Floyd (wait, come back!) as the Pixies. Some of the album's finest moments are to be found on the aforementioned ""Adoptuction"" and the album's penultimate track (and final song proper), ""Bloom On Demand,"" the latter showing off Seth Jabour's always sharp guitar bursts and snakey lines. Though not quite the aural scorched-earth campaign you'd have hoped for if you, too, were slaughtered by Rome (Written Upside Down), Go Forth is nonetheless going to make most people's year-end lists, and is more than reason enough to catch any of Les Savy Fav's famous live shows. These songs, a force in their own right, will sear in person, even if they're merely hot to the touch on record.","I've been with Go Forth for one full week now.

Infectious,Jigmastas,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f8eb335119a49ec906/1:1/w_160/3dd31e6f.jpg,2001-10-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4253-infectious/,Landspeed,"In 1964, Sociologist Ruth Glass coined the term ""gentrification"" to describe, loosely, the process whereby rich people ""discover"" an interesting working-class neighborhood, then drive up rents until ""most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed."" It's a sad phenomenon, but one that seems to have pervaded even the music industry; for example, look what happened to the blues, formerly the domain of forlorn, loveless sages like Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. Nowadays, you can record with Babyface, and still have the ""blues"" (see Eric Clapton). In the same vein, when Rod Stewart, once the purveyor of gritty, determined R&B; (see the Faces), discovered spandex, the masses discovered him, and he began his own gradual retardation. Unfortunately, in a different sense, gentrification also corrupted hip-hop. Back in the Golden Era of the late 80s and early 90s, hip-hop borrowed liberally from the pop and funk catalog of the prior decades, churning out beats that were at times fierce (Eric B and Rakim, Kool G Rap and DJ Polo), at times jazzy (A Tribe Called Quest, Brand Nubian) and at times political (Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions). It sounded good and it meant something, but most of all, it was accessible. A DJ didn't need a bankroll to sample ""Funky Drummer"" (which remarkably found its way onto over 150 tracks). Enter Gilbert O'Sullivan. Upset that Biz Markie and other young black men were making money, O'Sullivan decided he wanted a piece of the action. In 1991, he sued the Biz for his sample of O'Sullivan's 1972 love ballad, ""Alone Again (Naturally)."" Naturally, Markie lost the lawsuit, and naturally, that put the brakes on the breaks, so to speak-- unless artists obtained permission, and paid stiff premiums, the law deemed sampling to be theft. The only ones left with the means to pay for samples were major labels. Thus, while P. Diddy could lift anything from the Police's ""Every Breath You Take"" to Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir,"" working class artists were priced out of the beat market. Left ""beatless,"" just as the working-class were left homeless, hip-hop was effectively gentrified. Amidst gentrification, some DJs languished, but others just dug deeper. Count among the beat-miners DJ Spinna, mastermind of Brooklyn's underground duo Jigmastas, whose debut LP, Infectious, sports some of the most creative, palatable grooves recorded in years. And deep for Spinna is pretty damn deep; fuck Gilbert O'Sullivan-- we're talking tap-dancing-instruction-deep; the basic steps of a tap teacher, and her cryptic marching orders, form the backbone for the album's best (and maybe the year's best) jam, ""Don't Get It Twisted."" ""Twisted"" is reminiscent of post-Puba Brand Nubian, not just in the Sadat X cameo, but definitely in the groove. With the same kind of danceable, straight-up funk track that drove tunes like ""The Travel Jam,"" the song is emblematic of Spinna's talents; every element of every song plays a part in the groove. Even his obscure samples (tap dance, tower bells) embellish drum breaks, introduce melody, or add ambience. It's almost too seamless to be underground. ""Lyrical Mastery"" is another Spinna masterpiece. The song builds around a sparse, syncopated six-note organ riff and a simple breakbeat funky enough to chill your spine. The highlight reel rolls at the chorus, which is built from snippets of classic raps (nine in total, though not all recognizable). Unbelievably, the fabricated chorus not only rhymes, but makes sense. Lest we forget, the beneficiary of Spinna's beats, and the other half of Jigmastas, is a talented MC named Kriminul. Kriminul has a quick, clear, tenor delivery that doesn't call too much attention to itself, but blends in nicely with Spinna's production style. Kriminul's rhymes are usually intelligent and witty, although they occasionally suffer moments of blandness (being played by women, the police, other MCs). I'd set the ""dope-to-wack"" ratio on Kriminul's rhymes at about 3:1. Krim is by far at his most vapid on ""Hollar,"" featuring a guitar cameo by Living Colour's Vernon Reid, which laments racial profiling with the chorus, ""Why are you stressing me, wasting all my time?/ Time is money, why you searching through my ride?/ Cuz' I was cruising, minding my business/ What was I doing?/ You make me wanna hollar."" As mentioned, though, Krim hits the target about 75% of the time, which is more than you can say for most MCs. As it goes, gentrification ruins the old neighborhood. But the old ""neighbors"" have to go somewhere. The Jigmastas went underground, and have come forth with an LP as listener-friendly as it is creative and funky. This time, we can only hope that the tap-dance industry doesn't gentrify the underground.","In 1964, Sociologist Ruth Glass coined the term ""gentrification"" to describe, loosely, the process whereby rich people ""discover"" an interesting ...

The really old Pitchfork reader might remember when Spy was actually funny. Spy was an 80s publication all the way, and their sardonic blade was perfectly forged for carving up that particular decade. Once the 90s hit, Spy started to suck, and smarter, more ambitious mags like Might, Vice, and, well, Suck, filled the void. Spy used to have a regular feature called ""Logrolling in Our Time."" The idea behind the piece was to find examples of two writers criticizing each other's books at the same time, each giving the other a glowing review. You'd find a quote from Tom McGuane, say, going on about what a genius Jim Harrison was, and then next to that would be a quote from Harrison praising to the skies McGuane's latest opus. The idea being that literary criticism was an incestuous, backslapping, one-hand-washes-the-other kind of deal. I bring this up in the context of a Weights and Measures review as a means of full disclosure: I'm pals with the bass player from the band. You might feel like you know him, too, because he's none other than former Pitchfork writer Samir Khan, sworn enemy of folky pub bands from Great Big Sea to shining sea. Like Patti Smith, Neil Tennant and Ira Kaplan before him, Samir decided to leave the glamorous and personally fulfilling world of music criticism for the dull workaday grind of life in a rock band. Or rock bands, I should say, because Samir splits time between the aggro math-rock of Weights and Measures and the quiet, dreamy slowcore of Kepler. Weights and Measures released an eponymous album in 2000, which I enjoyed for its punishing sound and, on ""Skipping School on the First Day,"" the longest between-riff pause I've ever heard. This song is incredible-- I can run to the store and get a half-rack of beer in the silence between crunches. Now, the three men from Ottawa return with the short, punchy and satisfying EP, Tonight, the Lower Abdominals. Here we have six instrumental songs that tear by in 14 minutes. Seriously, these tracks book. Catchy and to the point, each basically serves to explore variations on a single well-constructed riff. Fall is upon us, but this is summer music. In fact, I didn't completely tune into Tonight, The Lower Abdominals until I heard ""The Economics of Looking Good"" blasting out of the factory deck of my Honda Civic, the copious distortion augmented by my seriously clipping 2.5 watts per channel amplifier. The complex drumming is tighter than Mark Knopfler's headband, basslines are fluid and tuneful, and the guitar alternates between jagged post-punk riffing and tense melodic counterpoint. The melodies here are stronger than on the debut, and an overwhelming sense of joy that comes through. Weights and Measures sound like they're having the time of their lives playing this driving, dynamic music, and I thank God and Angus Young (not necessarily in that order) that I live in a country where this music is not considered noise pollution.","The older Pitchfork reader might remember the satirical monthly magazine Spy.

On Double Exposure, sci-fi nerds Trans Am and metal geeks/70s corporate rock guitar solo aficionados the Fucking Champs join together in an unholy alliance appropriately dubbed TransChamps. The collaboration has near-infinite potential. Both Trans Am and the Fucking Champs have an astounding ability to turn laughable retro cheese into something thoroughly listenable, fun, and driving.

""Give It to You,"" the first track on Double Exposure hints at a promise of such a brilliant synthesis. The song opens with the Fucking Champs' trademark crunchy guitar riffing. But Trans Am immediately makes their presence known with hilariously ridiculous vocals. Imagine a guy with a slightly off-key baritone saying things like, ""C'mon, little girl/ It's time for school/ De-evolution/ On the streets/ A revolution/ In the sheets,"" over synchronized corporate rock guitar solos, and perhaps you'll get an idea of just how awesome ""Give It to You"" really is-- and how excellent Double Exposure as a whole might have been. On ""The Big Machine,"" Trans Am's futuristic sound dominates, with tinny trashcan percussion and burbly synthesizers. Unfortunately, the song never cashes in on its potential. When the Fucking Champs' unique guitar stylings finally do come in, they simply sound tacked-on, seeming as out-of-place as Blue Oyster Cult would in an episode of ""Voyager."" The following suite, ""First Comes Sunday Morning"" and ""Then Comes Saturday Night,"" utterly redeems the track, though, showcasing two different treatments for a single musical theme. The former is an acoustic guitar, string, and piano-laden foray into whimsy the likes of which is never really approached elsewhere on this EP. On ""Then Comes Saturday Night,"" that whimsy is coupled with some synchronized guitar soloing, double bass and heavy drumming. Strange effects are piled on, and the song builds to a powerful climax of heavily distorted guitars and bleeping synthesizers. It probably would have been a good idea to end Double Exposure on ""Then Comes Saturday Night."" Instead, we're treated to ""Somebody Like You,"" a moody, cheesily downcast number that never develops into much. While parts of this record truly do bring together the best of two similarly fun bands, the worst parts just sound like two different bands playing songs with each other, and never succeeding at combining their sounds into a cohesive final product. So it seems the question on everybody's minds hasn't quite been answered. But Double Exposure certainly suggests that a more in-depth collaboration between these two great bands could lead to a nerd alliance the likes of which the world has never seen, and the ramifications of which remain unknown.","What happens when metal geeks and sci-fi nerds join forces?

Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs,Atmosphere,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a135ea9e61561daa4749/1:1/w_160/ab583068.gif,2001-10-29 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/340-lucy-ford-the-atmosphere-eps/,BirdcageRhymesayers,"Remember your sophomore year when that girl (let's call her Nicole) broke your heart, inspiring the most heartfelt poetry ever committed to paper? Months went by and slowly you initiated an awkward friendship. Then one day, in a callow act of unadulterated love that has forever mitigated your ability to emote, you dumped all three notebooks of that semantically challenged crap on her, knowing that if she were to just read through the first ten pages she would come running back. Remember how she didn't? Well, that qualifies you to empathize with Slug of Minneapolis-based Atmosphere. Taking leave of his myriad hip-hop commitments (notably Anticon and Deep Puddle Dynamics), Slug embarks on the lyrical exorcism of the deified love of his life, Lucy Ford, on an album culled from three EPs formerly available only on vinyl. The rhymes often bounce between insightful social observation (a la Saul Williams) and authentic old-school wordplay, making for great late-night ear candy. Such is the case with ""Aspiring Sociopath,"" in which Slug marrs the sacred cow that is ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" (as well as other classic radio staples) as he desperately depicts the realities of a latter-day American road warrior who can only find solace and connection in the songs that blare on his car stereo. Elsewhere, you can almost hear the mental pages of wry sophomore poetry being turned. ""I bet my fans know me better than my friends do/ Because my friends don't pay that much attention/ The fans memorize every single sentence/ Which makes them far too smart to ever start a friendship."" But it's the eclectic and forbidding samples that make the disc a stark slice of modern Americana. The Mingus-style bass freak-out of ""It Goes,"" the climactic refrain of ""O' Holy Night"" wafting through ""If I Was Santa Claus""-- Atmosphere don't have the money to sample Sting and they're not afraid to show it. Rather, they make the most out of nothing and utilize their gloriously dirty production to great effect. Occasionally, it seems to be their recording technique which purveys a great deal of the album's intimacy rather than the content. Whatever it is, it seems to work on varying degrees and fails completely only once. While Slug's direct comments to his enigmatic Lucy character are normally provoking, ""Don't Ever Fucking Question That"" stands out as that one overtly obsessive poem written in an emotionally inebriated state that sent your second chances at true high school romance down the shitter (along with your notebooks). Luckily, the song is crammed between two of the album's best tracks and its duration could be used to roll down the windows, slow down the car, and dial up Nicole.","Remember your sophomore year when that girl (let's call her Nicole) broke your heart, inspiring the most heartfelt poetry ...

My Father My King EP,Mogwai,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37d5e6ef95969323849/1:1/w_160/545bb599.jpg,2001-10-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5366-my-father-my-king-ep/,Matador,"Mogwai fear Satan. So says the title of the closing track from their 1997 stunner debut, Young Team. This one song title has bewildered me more than any other in all of my musical excursions-- even more so than Roger Waters' ""Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict"" from Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Perhaps that confusion was caused more by the song itself rather than its title. But whereas ""Several Species"" takes the cake for evoking the most invigorated ""turn off that infernal racket"" responses, ""Mogwai Fear Satan"" represents all that's good about olympic post-rock: a driving theme, huge extended crescendos, a blatant climax, and a few orchestral instruments thrown in to boot. Sure, it's all cliché these days, but it's no less affecting or indispensable now than it was four years ago. As for the title, I attended church enough to know that Christians are to fear God and his ever-looming wrath. Conversely, Christians are not to fear Satan, as Jesus Christ has plans to do away with him when the time comes. So should this be interpreted as Satan worship? Juvenile provocation? Or are Mogwai genuinely frightened by all that's diabolical? Not a bit. Any time spent with the ultraviolent ""Like Herod"" rules that last one out. Perhaps it's important to consider that the base melody for Mogwai's My Father My King is extracted from a Jewish hymn traditionally sung on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which pleads to God for grace in spite of sins committed. While the track is performed as an instrumental, a translation of the hymn is included in the liner notes to this single-track EP: ""Inscribe us for blessing in thy book of life."" It all boils down to whether Mogwai actually intend for those implications to arise, or if they were just really into this fab Jewish melody that electro-wiz Arthur Baker taught them. My Father My King may be a formulaic return to Mogwai's epic canon, but there's no denying that these 20 minutes reaffirm faith in this Glaswegian quintet. This year's Rock Action, while nice enough, was anything but satisfying in light of Mogwai's overpowering live performances, or even recent outings like EP+2. But it's no accident that My Father My King is being marketed as a companion to Rock Action: this demonstration of might and dynamic is exactly what that album lacked. Mogwai waste no time introducing the middle-eastern, mid-tempo theme that will be reiterated and metamorphosed throughout the entire track. It begins with a lone, dry-signaled electric guitar in the right channel, which is followed by another in the left. Soon, drums enter with a steady, simplistic beat, miked to subwoofer-damaging perfection by Steve Albini. The two guitars diverge as the bass enters, continuing the melody in synched harmony. As the tension builds to capacity, and the death-metal fuzz distortion pedals are activated, the bass expands enough to shake the neighbor's rafters, and the drums crash perpetually. Around the six-minute mark, the song calms with some light ambient noise from one of the guitars, but gradually builds again to a second peak as the bass acquires its own distortion and a guitar noodles in the higher registers with a pitchshifter. Sixteen minutes marks collapse into phaser heaven feedback and fuzz harmonics, then white noise. During the final four minutes, the song grinds, locomotive-like, to a screeching halt, with the phased feedback dramatically cut off mid-iteration. For the most part, the song's structure seems standard in the world of olympic post-rock. But unlike Rock Action, this recording doesn't just push the envelope; it shoves. ""My Father My King"" had become a live staple before its commitment to tape, and Albini quite faithfully captures the concentrated force. Notorious for noise flirtation even in his major label days, Albini makes ""no-holds-barred"" a rallying cry as Mogwai kick their rendition into utter chaos. I haven't heard anything this fat and heavy since I spun Barry White and Rage Against the Machine simultaneously during a schizophrenic frat party DJ set. No, I wasn't drunk. I was experimenting. Which isn't exactly what Mogwai is doing. Of all post-rock's domineering forces, Mogwai are the most capable of kicking the genre where it hurts. Yet, I'm still confused by the religious connotations. Is it possible to have Jewish death-metal? And should I even be considering such interpretational matters?","Mogwai fear Satan.

It's got the most amazing combination of beaches, modernist architecture, grand boulevards, and rich nightlife one could ever imagine. That anyone would choose to live anywhere else is phenomenal to me. Why am I not in Barcelona? Maybe it's because they speak a funny language-- not Spanish, but Catalan, where they use x's in place of ch's. All those years of high school spent learning Spanish and all I can say is, ""No tengo una cabeza,"" like the crazy man who wanders my street at night. This is one probable reason the Gallygows sing in English. No, they're not crazy. They're from Barcelona, which you would never suspect, what with their hapless adoration for American and English pop. This is evidenced by their most amusing song on their debut album, ""Live at Budokan,"" which, in addition to making pointed reference to Cheap Trick, also contains the lyrics, ""Show you how here comes the sun/ I wanna play that song like John/ I can't help it."" Plus, the song is pure indie pop, rather than more derivative Kindercore drivel. Swinging melodies and condensed moments of dissonance resolving over strong basslines are the ingredients of the Gallygows' better songs. The opening track on Give It to Her, ""Tone Generator,"" employs these to the Nth while crafting perhaps the most amusing word-play on the album (""She was a queen in MIDI land doing hot top stereo pan/ He was a wide-band VCO but the lady wanted more/ Phase in, phase out/ What about being my tone generator?""). The Lennon kicks in much later, on ""My Citizen,"" when a monster buzz saws into a piano/acoustic thing lifted straight off ""A Day in the Life."" What makes it theirs is a weird, slipping melody, double-tracked in such a way that it can only be called Phil Collins-esque. It's that righteous, even with tucked away female back-ups. But on the next track, ""Wait,"" the horrific mid-temponess of the album starts setting in. Those sparse kicks, the strumming, and the Hammond lock groove, and suddenly the lack of inflection in the otherwise shiny pop vocals becomes irritating. ""Goalkeeper,"" which helps polish off the album, gets downright wedding-jam with heavy employment of a technique called ""the walking bassline,"" which can also be called the cheapest, most lackluster way to accompany chord changes in the Western world. Its final blow-out is what I, as a smug American, can call ""incredibly annoying Euro-noodling,"" which, unlike American noodling (Tortoise), employs cheesy synths, drum machines and vocals a la ""Video Killed the Radio Star."" ""Roller Disco Combo"" is a late-night, pot-smoking studio goof-off, placed as the final track to ensure that listeners understand it isn't their ""serious"" song. It's like Ladytron without the icy pretension. ""Confusing"" is the Gallygows position in the indie pop continuum. A third of Give It to Her is straightforward, Juliana Hatfield-style pop, another third bathes in Beatles, and the other third consists of Aislers Set-like modernism. What Gallygows lack is the full consciousness of their pop potential or the critical distance to cut away the dead weight. And with the Posies' Jon Auer helping craft their more ""pop"" moments, they best take the singles and run from their soft rock tendencies.","Barcelona rules.

Music Typewriter,Moreno Veloso +2,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a933ea9e61561daa59c6/1:1/w_160/da61d154.gif,2001-10-28 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8431-music-typewriter/,RykoHannibal,"""Like father, like son,"" goes the saying. In healthy father-son relationships, it's usually pretty much true-- from Cal Ripken Jr. following his father onto the Orioles, to my dad and I having similar senses of humor. And so it is with Moreno and Caetano Veloso. Caetano, the elder, is a veritable legend in Brazil, one of the most important musical forces in his country for the last 35 years, and a master of his art. And now, up steps his son Moreno to the plate, looking ready to take on his father's mantle after only a single album. It's fitting that the opener of Moreno's debut album should be a song co-written with his father. ""Sertao (Outback)"" is a flawlessly beautiful song about the peacefulness that music can induce (the lyrics are printed in both Portuguese and English, translated by Arto Lindsay), and Moreno handles acoustic guitar and cello with equal facility. What's even more impressive than his playing, though, is his voice, which hovers over the entire album like some sort of weightless object. Not only has he inherited his father's gift for effortless melody, but his tenor is also imbued with Caetano's sturdy character. That said, though, Moreno doesn't sound exactly like his father and seems to have worked rather diligently to develop a style that's uniquely his own. At the other end of the album, ""Sertao"" is complemented by what is possibly the prettiest thing I've heard all year: a simple, straight-forward cover of the Morey/Churchill song, ""I'm Wishing,"" originally featured in Disney's 1937 release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The arrangement is extremely simple-- only Moreno's voice, backed the sparse piano playing of another son of a Brazilian legend, Daniel Jobim. The lyrics alternate between the original English and Portuguese translations, and the music is played out of time, drawing out some phrases and shortening others for maximum impact. Stripped of its original maudlin arrangement and pretense, it's an incredibly moving song, closing the album on an unself-consciously pretty note. Between those two songs, Moreno and his collaborators (the +2 after his name are two extremely talented guys listed only as Domenico and Kassin) pull out basically every stop, combining traditional Brazilian sounds with everything from buzzing synth bass to theremins swarming around the edges of ""Das Partes (of Parts)."" If the bookends of Music Typewriter are designed to move your heart, then much of what lies in between is meant to move the rest of you. For proof, look no further than ""Arrivederci,"" with its buoyant rhythms, scratchy guitar and ridiculously funky bass parts. If your head isn't bobbing by the time you hit the first shout chorus, you must be dead. It's also one of a few songs where Moreno pulls out his trumpet, yet another instrument he seems born to play. ""Enquanto Isso (Meanwhile)"" busts out another funky groove, combining programmed drums with Domenico's able kit playing, and layering tumbling Portuguese guitars on top. Kassin's bass duels with the synth while Moreno's vocals soar several thousand feet above. One of the less noticeable differences between Moreno and his father (to English speakers, anyway) is that Moreno's lyrics rarely enter political territory the way Caetano's so often do. Whereas Caetano's latest album, Noites do Norte, focuses fully half of its songs on Brazil's legacy of slavery, Music Typewriter's lyrics remain fully content to dwell on more personal issues. Moreno's particularly adept at filling his songs with intense visual imagery and thoughtful discourse on the tried-and-true subject of love. At 28 years of age, and with only one album under his belt, it's hard to say whether or not Moreno Veloso's career will ever reach the breadth or importance of his father's, but it seems unfair to judge him on that now. Instead, I'm willing to take Music Typewriter for what it is: an excellent and very promising debut from a young artist who seems destined for great things.","""Like father, like son,"" goes the saying.

The Coast is Never Clear,Beulah,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a291b1335d7bf1698503/1:1/w_160/c8ab6016.gif,2001-10-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/680-the-coast-is-never-clear/,Velocette,"It's times like these that I begin to worry. Sure, over the last year or two my tastes in music have swung drastically toward the experimental and the avant-garde. But no matter how much noise I've listened to, I've always managed to retain my love for the straight-up pop song. After all, were it not for power chords and lush melodies, it's unlikely I ever would have bothered to step foot in a record store to begin with. If nothing else, I owe pop music a debt for first grabbing my ear and refusing to let go. This is why, when I listened to Beulah's The Coast is Never Clear for the first time, I got worried. This disc is loaded with pretty melodies, classic pop hooks, loud guitars over layers of strings and horns, and even the occasional ragtime piano or steel guitar, all built on a foundation of harmonic ba-dop-bop-bops. And yet, for some reason, nothing about it grabbed me. I began to fear the worst. Had the Nihilistic Spasm Bands and Acid Mothers Temples of the world spoiled pop music for me? After a few listens, it all came into focus: the problem wasn't mine; it was Beulah's. Beulah's previous album, When Your Heartstrings Break, was a masterpiece of orchestral 60s-style pop. From start to finish, it was catchy and unique, taking the style of 60s pop and turning it into something uniquely its own, replete with clever lyrics and impossible-to-shake hooks. On the surface, Beulah appears to have successfully replicated this formula. The Coast is Never Clear sounds a lot like its predecessor, but it lacks the originality and heartfelt delivery that won When Your Heartstrings Break a constant presence in so many disc players a couple summers back. Instead, Beulah now joins the ranks of bands like Ashley Park, and have been demoted from innovators to imitators. The album's opening chords are lifted almost directly from the Turtles' 1969 hit ""You Showed Me."" The songs that follow, ""A Good Man is Easy to Kill"" and ""What Will You Do When Your Suntan Fades?,"" incorporate hooks that bear hints of resemblance to the Flaming Lips' ""The Spark That Bled"" and Blur's ""Coffee and TV,"" respectively. Of course, given the finite number of chord progressions in the world, it's inevitable that some musical phrases rear their heads repeatedly. Still, to place such familiar themes at the beginning of the album-- and so close to one another, at that-- is like McDonald's hanging a picture of a Whopper in its window. I'm not accusing Beulah of thievery; they make use of these phrases in an original way, building new (and yes, even catchy) songs out of them. But when I hear them I can't help but think of a handful of bands that do this sort of thing just as well, if not better. Still, it's not quite so embarrassing as when the band recycles their own hooks. ""Gene Autry"" and ""Silver Lining"" both sound unmistakably like songs from When Your Heartstrings Break. Similarly, the lyrics on The Coast is Never Clear rarely stray far from the lyrical home built on the previous album-- loneliness, the west, and boring parties return as popular topics. But rather than elaborating on a theme (as David Byrne has over the course of a million and two songs about discomfort with success, or trying to find a home, for example), one gets the impression that the band is merely recycling what worked. This is certainly the case structurally. Most of these songs follow the pattern established on Heartstrings. With a few exceptions, they work like normal pop songs, but with more parts, often popping up at the bridge, at which point the band will present three of four tangential themes before wrapping up with another round of verse/chorus. It's a fun take on traditional song structure-- inventive without ever straying too far from home. Still, two-thirds of the way in, the Beulah formula becomes just as tiresome as that of conventional 50s pop songs. That's not to say The Coast is Never Clear is without its moments. ""I heard he wrote you a song/ But so what?/ Some guy wrote 69/ And one just ain't enough,"" sings Mikes Kurosky on ""Popular Mechanics for Lovers,"" while a fingerpicked banjo dances with acoustic guitar on a floor made of strings, horns and synth swoops. A few seconds later, all but a few strings and piano drops out, and the indie in-jokes give way to Kurosky's reverb-drenched voice singing of ""trying all the time to find/ Something that would make you mine/ But all I ever find, my love/ Are clichés that don't rhyme."" ""Gravity's Bringing Us Down"" follows, another strong moment, suggesting the album might salvage itself before the end. The band harmonizes, ""We're getting high/ But we're still feeling down/ Gravity finds a way/ Of pinning us to the ground."" The song progresses, switching from part to part in the trademark style described above. As the four-minute mark approaches, the bassist picks up a simple yet effective riff, injecting energy into the proceedings, and driving the song in a new direction. As he repeats himself, the other musicians' parts collapse into a cacophony that sounds equal parts Yo La Tengo and Elf Power. From a band so reliant on well-structured songs, it's an exciting moment. It's a shame that the rest of the album passes without many more of them. When Your Heartstrings Break was a drastic change for Beulah, the addition of countless session musicians transforming them from a stripped-down pair of Pavement wannabes into 60s-pop-revisionists supreme. Perhaps, The Coast is Never Clear could have benefited from another such shift-in-direction. As it is, too many of the songs here sound like reheated leftovers from the band's previous effort. On the one hand, I'm relieved. I still have a place in my heart for pop music after all. On the other hand, if The Coast is Never Clear is any sign, one of pop's most promising groups seems content to merely rest on their laurels. Are the songs catchy? Yes. But once they've caught you, they don't take you anywhere.","It's times like these that I begin to worry. Sure, over the last year or two my\n\ tastes ...

The Sea is Fierce EP,Elk City,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc48ea9e61561daa743f/1:1/w_160/cc35be0d.gif,2001-10-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2750-the-sea-is-fierce-ep/,Warm,"For some bands, an EP is simply an appetizer for the eventual full-length-- one or two examples of their best material, some filler, and maybe a cover tune thrown in to give listeners a ready-made reference point. But for other bands, the EP provides a perfect dose of what they have to offer. New York's Elk City fit in the latter category. Their music, while lush and often captivating, gets tiring over the long haul. The trio's debut, for example, 2000's Status, contained many memorable highlights, but as a whole, it overstayed its welcome with too many similarly paced songs. The Sea is Fierce, a new five song EP, is much more flattering to the band's blend of urban psych-folk. Guitar, drums, and various keyboards (especially Rhodes) combine to create a mood similar to Galaxie 500, Low, or Cowboy Junkies, but more willing to take the BPM count up a few notches on occasion. The vocal duties are pretty evenly split between Peter Langland-Hassan, who also plays guitar, and Reneé LoBue, who handles most of the keyboard work. This dynamic between male and female singers, when utilized in the same song, creates a vague tension and uneasiness. But then, you get the feeling this isn't being used to its full potential: the lyrics are often just too cloudy to pull it off. The first thing you hear on this EP is the fiery guitar workout by Langland-Hassan which opens ""Take Me Out,"" sounding incredibly similar to the theme from ""Kids in the Hall"" (only much grittier), and the rest of the band rocks out following his lead. But by the one-minute mark, their meds kick in-- either that, or they're all submerged in some kind of super-viscous fluid, slowing things to a sludgy crawl. This is when LoBue's sultry moan, sounding not unlike ex-Mazzy Star singer Hope Sandoval or Over the Rhine's Karin Bergquist, enters: melancholy, hypnotic, and above all, nocturnal. The lyrics take a backseat to the singing, though-- something about how ""the state I'm in is not my state of mind,"" and how her brother likes the Who and the Kinks-- along with distorted, reverb-soaked vocal interjections by her counterpart. It's all a little unclear. Elk City is all about mood and atmospherics; if you're looking for narrative, look elsewhere. After about four minutes, Langland-Hassan gets bored and decides his guitar needs to take over again, stomping on the distortion pedal and going for guitar-god status. This goes on for about four more minutes (which means we're nearing the nine minute-mark here with this opening song, for those of you not keeping score). And I said this band was better in small portions, right? Well, right. Thankfully, they only pull this kind of thing once on The Sea is Fierce. But the solo actually isn't that bad. Far from gratuitous or over-indulgent, it actually hangs around only as long as it needs to. Listening to it, I could finally kind of hear the link between Peter Buck's concise college rock riffs and the near-eternal distortion sculptures Neil Young creates in concert. With ""Turpentine,"" the chairs are switched: Langland-Hassan takes the lead vocal seat and LoBue provides a refrain of sorts. Essentially, it's an organ-driven come-down number with a much more sober and shorter guitar solo bridge. Langland-Hassan's voice, when unaltered by effects, comes awfully close to sounding like a Tom Verlaine imitation (not that this is a bad thing). This is best heard on the upbeat, almost pop-punkish ""Three Ears,"" which paradoxically sees the band come closest to throwing off the shackles of their combined influences. There's one particular line in the song (""big tits are never enough"") that seems out of place and threatens to derail the whole thing, but taken in context, it's not really all that bad. A cover of Galaxie 500's ""Strange"" from their 1989 classic, On Fire, comes next. It's always a little disappointing when a band covers a song by an glaringly obvious influence-- it just seems like they're not trying-- but Elk City stamp this one with enough personality to let it slide. ""Bar Song"" finishes off the EP with a modernist take on the nineteenth century sea chantey, with very Mercury Rev-esque singing-saw accompaniment courtesy of the Music Tapes' Julian Koster. The whole thing is over in about 25 minutes, which is just about right. It's hard to see how Elk City could sustain a listener's interest for much longer than this without significant additions to either their musical or lyrical vocabulary. They've got a few promising tools at their disposal: a great guitarist (with maybe a slight tendency to wank, but properly harnessed, it could be used for the Forces of Good) and two distinctive vocalists. But these seductions are short-lived, and once you've settled into the band's sound, there's not much else to keep you occupied. The key ingredient they're missing, and what separates them for the time being from, say, Low, is that elusive quintessence: strong songwriting.","For some bands, an EP is simply an appetizer for the eventual full-length-- one\n\ or two examples of their ...

Blueprint for a Sunrise,Yoko Ono,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e5eb335119a49ec8c9/1:1/w_160/3b065624.gif,2001-10-25 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6010-blueprint-for-a-sunrise/,Capitol,"Yoko Ono was born February 18th, 1933 in Tokyo. She is 68 years old, and has been hated longer than many of you have existed. Ono's art, while internationally respected and admired for decades, has been overshadowed by a sect of music fans who believe she was responsible for tearing apart the great white hopes of rock and roll. There are people who say she's still wreaking havoc by manipulating her murdered husband's image to suit her professional obligations and lifestyle of comfort beyond luxury. There are even people who think it was she who should've taken the bullet all those years ago to spare us a lifetime of wondering whether the Four Saviors would come back to cure the world's ills. Yoko Ono is an artist and a wronged woman. These are roles she has performed increasingly well with age. Currently, the first American retrospective of her work is touring the United States. The exhibition chronicles everything from her foray into the avant-garde conceptual art of the 1960s, to her bed-ins for peace with John Lennon, to her first solo records in the 1970s and 80s, to her concerts and Internet projects in the 1990s and today. It seems that Ono would be able to establish her name without much help from her once-better half, but none of the exhibitions or press releases ever seem to dissuade the legions of grudge holders from her past. Despite Ono's unfair treatment, she does leave herself open to a lot of valid criticism. Primarily, as long as she makes records, there will always be the charge that she isn't really a singer, or even a musician. Her first records with John Lennon didn't exactly ingratiate her to Beatle fans with their feedback-drenched, primal scream freak-outs. She put out some solo discs in the early 70s (featuring many of the same musicians as were performing with Lennon at the time), but her brand of ""pop"" was rarely less confrontational than her public persona at the time. The singing was usually closer to spoken word, and the melodies, while sometimes hummable, weren't exactly the kind that would end up in Nike commercials. And of course, the freak-outs never really went away. Some of the critical weight was lifted after her 1980 collaboration with Lennon, Double Fantasy, and her subsequent solo record Season of Glass, largely due to an emphasis on straightforward pop, though still with that instantly recognizable Ono croon. More recently, she has taken to performing with her son, Sean Lennon. Rising, from 1995, was a pairing of her usual avant-garde musings on angst, pain and fear, and the hard funk and alt-groove of Sean's rock trio, IMA. Bringing her sound and vision up to date was an admirable step, especially for someone who was approaching legal retirement age, and her latest album, Blueprint for a Sunrise, continues in that vein. Okay, so now you know the story. If only digging the music was the next logical step. Blueprint is something of a memoir for Ono's childhood in Japan, during World War II, and simultaneously a message in a bottle for frustrated women everywhere-- especially those who ""still live in fear because of the position they are put in as women in our society."" How's that for conceptual art? She goes the extra step by appearing on the cover as disgraced Chinese Empress Tz'u-hsi, a woman whose biggest claims to fame were selling out her country to British colonialists and killing her son. As artistic statements go, this album (and perhaps Ono's career) is either the product of visionary genius, or one giant mixed signal. ""I Want You to Remember Me"" (comprising the first two tracks as parts A and B) is rather brutal truth and consequences. Yoko vocalizes both sides of a domestic dispute, channeling what must be some very bitter memories, over a heartbeat pulse. This leads directly to a spacy jam wherein she un-tucks her patented Yoko shrieks and yodels. ""Gotta kill, gotta kill, gotta kill,"" goes the hook, and before you start to check your locks, consider that she might be making some kind of abstract statement about the helplessness of many women. Of course, I couldn't prove that, but I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt here. Next up is Ono's version of the torch song, ""Is This What We Do."" Leading off with some nice Spanish guitar (?), building to Metallica-style mega-ballad heaviness (??), and featuring Yoko doing her impression of the Asian Leonard Cohen (???), the song almost lets you off the hook unscathed, before she lets loose with more shrieking near the end. That's alright, though, because the next tune, ""Wouldnit,"" is merely awkward. Ono drops lines like ""Daddy, you can't touch me/ Mommy, you can't hate me/ I'm a star, get it?"" and ""Wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit,"" over a cocktail lounge groove destined for Hell's karaoke bars. And lest you think Ono has forgotten her roots, consider ""Rising II"" and ""Mulberry."" Combined, you have about 20 minutes of prime, live freaking. Sean accompanies his mother to unfettered aural catharsis, often sung in many languages at once. Props to this family for pushing ahead when others are sitting down to TV dinners and Pictionary, but sometimes, when artists refuse to compromise, it makes it difficult to meet them halfway. In short, I respect Ono's art; I just can't listen to a lot of it. Blueprint for a Sunrise isn't completely impregnable. ""It's Time for Action"" is pretty good avant-funk along the lines of recent Peter Gabriel, and ""I Remember Everything,"" with the calmness of Ono's voice in the opening and some rather pretty guitar from her son, almost fools you into thinking she'd let you up for a moment to breathe. I was sucked in until the Metallica power-balladry reared its head again, raising the question of just what music Sean is playing for his mom these days. If you've made it this far in the review, I assume you must have at least a passing interest in Yoko Ono (or Metallica). To that, I say, ""Congratulations."" You've successfully gone against trends and general consensus, and can accept her abstractions as the idiosyncrasies of an artist. Objectively, I'm right there with you, and would add that the days of thinking of her as John Lennon's wife, or as the woman who broke up the Beatles should be forever put to rest. That said, I might need more traditional ""rock"" than her music is giving me, and though I'll never criticize someone who puts their soul on display for their art, I can't guarantee I'll be able to listen to it very long.","Yoko Ono was born February 18th, 1933 in Tokyo.

Drukqs,Aphex Twin,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c49d034d5c69bf27cd/1:1/w_160/9a903eca.gif,2001-10-25 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/225-drukqs/,WarpSire,"Drukqs. Druck-kyoos. Drug use? Or just another one of the Twin's cryptic pranks? Your guess is as good as mine. After two years of public silence and what many had judged to be his final exit from the world of corporate music, the original IDM iconoclast has returned with another puzzle. The problem with Drukqs, a two-disc, 30-track medley that allegedly wraps up Richard D. James' contract with Warp Records, is that there's really no puzzle at all. This album charts familiar Aphex territory, surveying styles he's plied on previous records, rather than suggesting new directions. It says something that Aphex enthusiasts expect James to reinvent himself with every record, and that the general reaction to this album (which has been trading hands over online piracy channels for months) has been somewhat unenthusiastic. From a man who has made a career staying a step ahead of his fans, an album as conventional as Drukqs comes as a sad surprise. The stylistic pastiche here mirrors many different points of James' career. Most of the tracks are brief melodic exercises conducted on piano and harpsichord, styled after ""Nannou"" from the Windowlicker EP. There are several purely electro-acoustic excursions, some in the cacophonous vein of the ""equation"" song on Windowlicker, others more reminiscent of the lysergic drone of Selected Ambient Works II. ""Bbydhyonchord"" and ""Orban Eq Trx4"" emulate the rhythmic, sensual sounds of Analogue Bubblebath 4, or the softer facets of I Care Because You Do. Abrasive electro pieces like ""Omgyjya Switch7"" and ""54 Cymru Beats"" steal the show, grafting drill-n-bass beats onto stark mechanical backdrops that recall James' early Joyrex releases. But Drukqs showcases Aphex's crude instrumental contemplations to a fault. His production talents have their bounds, and they wear a little thin when he dons the mantle of artistic maturity, attempting to imitate Erik Satie. ""Father,"" ""Avril 14th,"" ""Strotha Tynhe"" and ""Jynweythek Ylow"" rove dangerously close to the Windham Hill new age aesthetic of the 80s.\t""Prep Gwarlek 3b"" and ""Kladfvgbung Micshk"" take the formula to a more sophisticated, brooding level, but fail to bring anything exciting to a sound that Philip Glass pioneered more boldly 25 years ago. These languid noodlings comprise over half of the album; take them away and the cracks begin to show in Drukqs' monumental 30-song promise. In the end, with all the filler, this monster packs a lot less punch than some of Aphex's shorter releases, like the legendary Selected Ambient Works 85-92, or the Hangable Auto Bulb EPs. James fares better in other arenas. A muffled, throbbing pulse propels ""Gwely Mernans"" through a macabre tableau of disembodied strings and white noise. Though not on par with the best ambient work in Aphex Twin's canon, this song weaves a compelling web of mood and texture. ""Hy a Scullys Lyf a Dhagrow"" takes ambient music to the other extreme with a disjointed demonstration of ear-shattering sonic sleight. ""Gwarek2,"" one of the most chilling additions yet to James' demented repertoire, sounds like a stripped down take on \xB5-Ziq's ""Mr. Angry."" Tortured screams resonate through an abandoned foundry, joined by the unsettling clamor of clashing metal and screeching vermin. ""Meltphace 6"" delivers in signature Aphex style, with brisk snares trading fire over a wash of solemn synthesizers, thick squelches and warbling, high-pitched flourishes. ""Mt. Saint Michel Mix+St. Michael's Mount"" carries the torch, matching its relentless drill-n-bass torrents with simple, innocent refrains. In its final minutes, the song frays into a stuttering swarm of dissected, time-spaced samples-- certainly one of Drukqs' finer moments. Other honorable mentions include ""Vordhosbn,"" whose wistful and occasionally dissonant timbre is offset by the biting ring of blistering drums. Imagine ""IZ-US"" with Venetian Snares operating the drum kit, and you'll get the general picture. The protean ""Ziggomatic v17"" runs through several movements-- frenzied electro breakcore and anthemic 4/4 warehouse techno, interspersed with lush melodic passages-- before tapering off with a soft refrain. ""Taking Control"" is concentrated Aphex acid. The scathing electro breaks and spliced, vocoded samples evoke memories of ""Humanoid Must Not Escape"" from Joyrex J9. But the absence of engaging melody and firm structure keep ""Taking Control"" and a several other songs (""Cock/Ver10,"" ""Afx237 v7"") from really enveloping the listener. The sterile, clinical feel and limited palette of the heavier electro numbers renders them grating, one-dimensional and sometimes entirely unlistenable. Even the successful drill-n-bass pieces offer only shallow satisfaction. They sound like throwbacks to the past rather than prospects on the future; and for all of their compositional strength, there's an element of the Aphex Twin mystique missing. This record simply doesn't inspire the same degree of astonishment and awe as its predecessors-- seminal works like I Care Because You Do, Selected Ambient Works II and his last proper full-length, 1997's The Richard D. James Album, which not only struck fans on a personal level, but often reshaped the way they listened to music. Drukqs speaks a familiar tongue, instead of inviting us to learn new languages; it gives us the answers before asking the riddles. In this sense, it defies every expectation we had of Richard D. James. But in hindsight, it seems to show that some conventions are worth following.","Drukqs. Druck-kyoos. Drug use? Or just another one of the Twin's\n\ cryptic pranks? Your guess is as good ...

Immediate Action,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a798c0084474cd0c0c14/1:1/w_160/b2751d1b.gif,2001-10-25 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1905-immediate-action/,Hefty,"My initial exposure to John Hughes III's Hefty label was the none-too-inspiring math-rock outfit Chisel Drill Hammer. There was something so very Chicago about that record, from the Albini recording to the geometric packaging to the Slint-strumental guitar rock that wasn't really rock. Even with my limited exposure to the scene, I had a vague feeling that Hughes was trying to cast Hefty in the Thrill Jockey mold. Chisel Drill Hammer braced me for a spate of uninspired copies. Thrill Jockey still seems like an inspiration, but Hefty seems to have overhauled the quality control department. The label still keeps a finger in the post-rock pie, and like Thrill Jockey, also dabbles in fusion and free jazz. But lately, electronic music seems to be coming to the fore for Hefty. Unlike Thrill Jockey, which licenses most of its experimental electronic music from Europe, Hefty's IDM talent pool is drawn primarily from the States, with releases by Scott Herren (as Savath + Savalas), Twine, and Hughes himself (as Slicker). In late 2000, Hefty released a series of 12-inches under the heading Immediate Action. These records had a limited print run and were packaged and presented in a simple manner intended to keep the focus on the music. In addition to featuring artists from the Hefty stable, Immediate Action releases included exclusive tracks and remixes from artists on others imprints. If you weren't one of the 700-or-so people to acquire each vinyl release, you have a second chance, as Hefty has gathered the tracks together on two shiny, portable compact discs. Casting aside the aim of the original vinyl issues, Immediate Action is a fine collection on its own, and a perfect example of what a multi-artist label compilation should be. Like Mille Plateaux's famous compilations, Immediate Action avoids the tired ""here are some tracks by some artists on our label"" approach in favor of a wide-ranging statement of belief. And what does Hefty believe in? While the styles on display throughout Immediate Action are familiar to followers of experimental indie music (glitch, machine dub, jazz fusion, etc.), Hefty seems to show a preference for accessibility, and few tracks could be described as cold, sterile or abstract. Hearing Scott Herren's organic work as Savath + Savalas again, after time spent with to his Delarosa + Asora and Prefuse 73 guises, is illuminating. ""Two Blues for Marion Brown"" is mellow electric jazz with glowing keyboards, a patient rhythm and distant hints of machine noise. ""Yesterday's Throwaway and Reprise,"" with its double bass, vibes, and crisp drumming, moves even further from the hard-drive IDM and glitch-hop of more recent Herren projects. Also on the jazzy tip is the Samadha Trio, a groovy combo with a forthcoming Hefty full-length. They remind me of a more relaxed Medeski, Martin and Wood with a penchant for heavy post-production. Live recordings of the electric keyboard/bass/drum trio are tweaked and reconfigured into a refreshing and slightly disorienting mix. The rhythm in ""Amidha"" drops out suddenly as bits of static bubble through, while the Bill Evans-ish acoustic piano in ""Satoric"" competes with a background conversation that could be a film sample. England's Process represents the less musical end of Immediate Action's spectrum, but even his computerized soundscapes are engaging and accessible. ""Define"" seeks the warm cloud of static Jan Jelinek likes to float in, while ""Diffusion"" touches on the slightly harsh industrial drone music of Janek Schaefer. In a similar vein is Twine's excellent ""Surn,"" which combines a regal piano melody with digital noise and a hesitant, unsteady beat. Further diversity comes from Johnny Herndon of Tortoise and Isotope 217, who contributes two inviting tracks of melodic electronic dub under the unfortunate moniker A Grape Dope. Most interesting on Immediate Action are the tracks where Reaktor programming meets pop vocals. Bogdan Raczynski's remix of Hughes' ""Yet You're Here"" find him immersing Hughes' deep voice in the crunchy, music-box-gone-wrong sound so prevalent on his recent full-length, My Love I Love. Better still is the Slicker collaboration with the Aluminum Group on ""Next Time,"" which contrasts rich machine noises with the dry, brittle sound of Navin's typically crafty vocal. An album-length project with these two camps would be more than welcome. Immediate Action finds Hefty in the thick of what's happening in the crowded zone between indie rock and the experimental electronic fringe. The label is gaining character and complexity with age, and this encouraging two-disc set feels much more ""pre"" than ""post.""","My initial exposure to John Hughes III's Hefty label was the none-too-inspiring math-rock outfit Chisel Drill Hammer.

Zacks,Phthalocyanine,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0669d034d5c69bf26e3/1:1/w_160/6b844497.jpeg,2001-10-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6280-zacks/,Phthalo,"Dimitri Fergadis, founder of the Los Angeles-based electronic/noise label Phthalo and mastermind behind Phthalocyanine, was the first American artist to be represented on the stellar German experimental label, A-Musik. His first single was released on Plug Research, the one American label whose output will soon rival sultan-of-the scene, Warp. The microtonal glitch stable, Mille Plateaux, called Fergadis in for remix work on Crank's * Wanton Phenomena * and Richie Hawtin's buddy Vapourspace (aka Mark Gage) did the same for his ""Steam"" single. After Planet \xB5 founder Mike Paradinas called Fergadis ""a genius,"" that label released Phthalocyanine's * 25 Tracks Fer 1 Track * album. When Fergadis isn't screening his phone calls, he runs his Phthalo imprint, which appears to operate with the same aesthetic and disdain for convention as lo-fi maverick Mike Newell's cassette-only Man at the Off-License label. Quite a few of Phthalo's releases are CDR-only, and the packaging is unequivocally rudimentary. But who gives a gnat's nut when the music is as fucking amazing as this? A clear testament to the quality of the Phthalo label lies with its esteemed roster: Finnish techno maestro Vladislav Delay released material under his Sistol alias; former Strictly Ballroom-er Jimmy Tamborello offered his first Dntel albums, * Early Works for Me If It Works for You * and * Something Always Goes Wrong * ; glitch maven Kit Clayton used the imprint as an outlet for his most extreme noise terror joint, * Shortwave Live * . But Fergadis' own releases are far more subdued. Though listeners may initially be distracted, and possibly even phased, by the Merzbow-like distortion Fergadis applies to most of his frantic drum patterns, the four untitled tracks that comprise * Zacks * eventually reveal themselves to be profoundly relaxing. Relaxing, how? I find Fergadis' combining of semi-melodious primitive synths (on the second track, they sound especially close to the sounds Aphex used on * Selected Ambient Works 85-92 * ) and the Elvin Jones-style splatter-percussion to be truthful. Truthful? To me most ambient music refuses to grapple with the ambience of existence. Fluffy excursions into pan-flutes can never acknowledge that our everyday lives are surrounded by dangers-- whether they be car accidents, a sudden myocardial infarction, or inhaling terrorist-deployed biotoxins. For me, Fergadis depicts this reality, but not as a cold reportage. In its own way, his music represents daily hazards, just as Muslimgauze musically engaged in the debate over the future of the Palestinian people. He may not have such an edgy subject, but it's a universal one. The crescendo and decrescendos of * Zacks * ' third track, to me, stand for the successes and failures of existence. Even amidst the most shredding of percussion attacks (most of track four), a precious bent-jazz beauty shines through. If you're not prepared to head straight into such a gyre of contrasts, but are interested in investigating Phthalocyanine, I recommend starting with the expanded * Viridian * EP. It's vintage * Tri-Repetae++ * -era Autechre dissolved in the hazy ambience of Seefeel's * Polyfusia * mini-LP. But regardless of which release you choose, you're guaranteed to catch the first wave of an artist destined for greatness.","Dimitri Fergadis, founder of the Los Angeles-based electronic/noise label Phthalo\n\ and mastermind behind Phthalocyanine, was the first American ...

Early Recordings,Quasi,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c89d034d5c69bf2a37/1:1/w_160/6fb4ab0d.gif,2001-10-24 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6619-early-recordings/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"Quasi has never been the kind of band to give it to you straight. The very notion of the group-- a divorced couple playing pessimistic, oft-guitarless pop music-- elicits furrowed eyebrows from the uninitiated. In the case of those who've heard the scathing rumors as to the nature of the breakup between Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss, those furrowed eyebrows are often accompanied by agape jaws. Given the rather twisted nature of the band's history, it seems kind of disappointing that Early Recordings, 19 tracks culled from tapes recorded by Sam and Janet in 1995, is pretty much entirely what you'd expect it to be. That is, Early Recordings sounds like Quasi... but earlier. One criticism that has been leveled against Featuring ""Birds""-era Quasi is that, while their songs were unquestionably catchy and clever, they were all catchy and clever in the exact same way. Sam Coomes belts out some seventh-chord progression on his Roxichord, Janet Weiss pops in with a sparse but rocking beat, and one or both of the divorcees begin musing about the sheer suckiness of life in a sweet melody. And while it's true that Quasi's most distinctive and memorable songs are largely similar, their albums have always included enough variety to keep things from getting terribly stale. Perhaps more importantly, even when Quasi do sink into cliché, they sink into their own clichés, rather than usual ubiquitous clichés of pop music. As is usually the case with pre-debut album collections, Early Recordings is all over the place. Small hints of what would go on to become the band's trademark sound are here in spades, but are often lost in general messiness. Which is not to say that the record is bad. It's a largely exploratory recording-- the sound of two people tinkering around with various instruments and trying to figure out what works. While the downside to such a recording is the previously addressed mess factor, the upside is that, every once in a while, you're privy to one of those moments when a band locks into something really, really good. Early Recordings opens with ""Two Hounds,"" a Coomes-penned instrumental that isn't all that different from the instrumentals that appear on later Quasi records. A simple piano figure, a straightforward drumbeat, and some guitar parts for flavor constitute one of the better tracks on Early Recordings. With cleaner production and more focused instrumental parts, ""Two Hounds"" would be at home on any Quasi record from R&B; Transmogrification to The Sword of God, making it a decidedly appropriate opener for this compilation. ""Time Flies By,"" an early Coomes/Weiss collaboration, sees the band further carving out their own distinctive sound. Quasi is one of the only bands that can pull off boy/girl harmonies without making me want to shoot myself in the face, and ""Time Flies By"" showcases the laid-back vocal interplay that sets Quasi apart from most cloying couple-rockers. ""Homonculus"" marks the first appearance of the moderately off-kilter chord progressions that would become a staple in later records, but disintegrates far too quickly into aimless fucking around. Considering that these 19 songs were recorded before R&B; Transmogrification and haven't been released until now, it's not surprising that they're not exactly fit for public consumption. While there are certainly a few excellent moments on Early Recordings, they only reveal themselves to people who are willing to wade through 19 severely spotty tracks. If you insist on having every decent recording Quasi has ever made in your possession, by all means go out and buy Early Recordings. If you're curious as to what the band sounded like pre-R&B; Transmogrification, listen to any of their proper albums and imagine. It's pretty much the same thing.","Quasi has never been the kind of band to give it to you straight. The very notion\n\ of the ...

Heavenly vs. Satan,Heavenly,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c092c0084474cd0c31e6/1:1/w_160/a2d2f9eb.gif,2001-10-24 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3792-heavenly-vs-satan/,KK,"Today, I saw something that, as a music lover, offended me deeply. It was a 24k gold disc, master version reissue of Lita Ford's Lita-- the kind of repackaging job that you usually see wrapped around a Pink Floyd or a Rolling Stones album. The amount of attention that must have been spent on this disc, which was only notable in the world of rock music for the record-breaking amount of semen that the hit video ""Kiss Me Deadly"" coaxed from the loins of pubescent boys everywhere, is unforgivable. Sure, taste in music is subjective. But it's not that subjective. Thank heaven that more worthwhile out-of-print discs are seeing the light of day despite wasteful efforts like the Lita project. K Records, owners of Heavenly's later releases, realized that a crucial milestone in the band's catalog was out of print and decided to take action. Augmenting the band's original 1990 mini-LP debut with six additional tracks-- three early singles and their b-sides-- along with new cover art and liner notes to dress it up, K's reissue of Heavenly vs. Satan arrives over a decade later and not a moment too soon. No more spending vacations in Japanese indie stores hunting through the ""H"" section for me. Heavenly was twee almost since the beginning; certainly much earlier than any negative connotations accumulated on the word like ship barnacles. A band born, reborn and then born again, they began as cult phenoms Talulah Gosh in 1986, enjoying critical adoration and the corresponding low record sales. After transmutating to Heavenly in the early 90s, they enjoyed a lengthier and more critically lauded career before shapeshifting once again to Marine Research. But the main twee thread remained ever-present throughout all these costume changes. If rock speaks to lust and pop love, then twee is about crush: superficial love with an undercurrent of tragedy. Heavenly's lyrics emphasize and exemplify love, trust, hurt, awkwardness and insecurity-- the most basic and adolescent of love's entanglements. And in a fashion, the listener quickly develops a crush of their own on the music of Heavenly, focusing on trivia such as the cute hiccup of singer Amelia Fletcher on the third verse of ""Our Love is Heavenly,"" or the tic-tac guitar shuffle Peter Momtchiloff provides in ""Boyfriend Stays the Same."" It's a superficial appeal, but that's the point. Crush, remember? Including the three singles and their b-sides here was a respectable move on K's part. The a-sides ""I Fell in Love Last Night"" and ""Our Love is Heavenly"" are both damning evidence in the case of Sarah vs. Sub Pop for best seven-inches of the late 80s/early 90s. Pop masterpieces, each of them, the latter boasts one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard. Fans of the Cardigans and the Sundays will instantly spot the obvious influence from this one track alone. But the most stellar moment on the disc comes with ""Shallow."" Starting with simple ringing guitar notes that presage the chord progression to come (in a fashion very reminiscent of the Cure's ""Boys Don't Cry""), a sublime jangle kicks in and drives the song along at a two-step pace. Tragi-pitiful lyrics spell out the narrator's self-delusion: ""Singing your praises/ While you're with her/ Foolishly patient for your return/ Silent you left me/ And silence stays."" One of the tolerance testers you may experience on this album is the sheer quantity of such treacly richness. With each song so sugary sweet, listening to Heavenly vs. Satan can, at times, be like post-Halloween gorging on a Hefty bagful of fun-size booty. And there are a few duds, such as ""Lemonhead Boy,"" which just sounds a little too frenetic, and the b-side closer ""Escort Crash on Marsten Street"" with its corny car crash plotline. But even these are minor flaws that sound more like growing pains than botched pieces. So much more than just a key historical listen, the music on this Heavenly reissue does more than merely justify K Records' effort; it makes it an imperative. The progression from C-86 founding scenesters Talulah Gosh to Heavenly, and their maturation through tragedy into Marine Research, mirrors the evolution of carbon: from peat to coal to diamond. And while diamond may be more polished and prettier to behold-- both fair assessments of Marine Research's latter-day updating of the Heavenly sound-- coal still burns more brightly. Heavenly vs. Satan is radiant.","Today, I saw something that, as a music lover, offended me deeply. It was a 24k gold disc, master version ...

Sun Blindness Music,John Cale,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ccea9e61561daa4fc6/1:1/w_160/ce11382f.gif,2001-10-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1223-sun-blindness-music/,Table of the Elements,"When John Cale's name is dropped, any number of things might pop into your head, but chances are, it's going to be his work with the Velvet Underground. Even so, it would be shortsighted to think that his influence and importance in the last 40 years began and ended with the Velvets. Cale's rarely stopped moving in the three decades since VU disbanded, constantly shedding skins and adopting the role of shapeshifter: he's been an acclaimed solo artist (Paris 1919, Fear), a producer (Patti Smith's Horses, the Stooges, the Modern Lovers), a collaborator (Terry Riley, Nico, Brian Eno) and a soundtrack composer (Somewhere in the City). Much has been made in the avant-garde community about La Monte Young's Theater of Eternal Music (or Dream Syndicate), of which Cale was a member, along with Tony Conrad, Marian Zazeela and original VU drummer Angus Maclise. Last year saw the first release of their notorious 1965 recording, Inside the Dream Syndicate, Volume 1: Day of Niagara, a brief live representation of what the group was trying to accomplish in the mid-60s. Even with the extremely lo-fi sound quality, it's obvious that the Dream Syndicate collective was dabbling in sound worlds theretofore untouched-- minimalist drones, hypnotic chants and scraping noise barrages. Now the exhumation of several archival recordings sheds light on another dimension in Cale's chameleonic nature. Sun Blindness Music captures some of Cale's home improvisations during a period paralleling that of the Velvets' most provocative work (1965-68). It's the first disc of three in a series of unearthed Cale compositions from Table of the Elements (all released under the heading New York in the 1960s), documenting his solo experiments and collaborations with other members of New York's avant-garde underground. Collecting dust in Tony Conrad's possession for years, these tapes were probably all but forgotten by everyone excepting possibly Conrad and Cale. Some will undoubtedly argue they should have stayed that way. The record is comprised of three tracks, two of which are centered on Cale's experiments with a Vox Continental organ. Its title track is an incredibly extended improvisation consisting of just Cale and the Vox. Without any real structure, Cale fools around with minimalist sound dimensions. He jams keys into place, locks into a series of drones, mounts pressure on the organ, clusters notes and creates a dissonant wash of noise. At times, Cale occupies himself with an escalating build of resonant, booming drones; other times, drones disintegrate into silence as Cale fumbles for another cluster of keys to wedge in place. Unlike what most people perceive as minimalism, this opening track is propelled by momentous force, dynamism and sweat. It can be both mesmerizing and disconcerting, often within a brief time span. Regardless, at 42 minutes, it's an endurance test no matter who's listening. However, for those willing to provide full attention and look past the somewhat lo-fi sound, it can be a meditative piece of work filled with vibrating textures and radiating intensity. Beyond the difficult and lengthy nature of ""Sun Blindness Music,"" the remainder of the album is slightly more accessible. ""Summer Heat"" is a raucous guitar-driven track where everything is awash with massive distortion. The final result sounds more like pounding percussion than guitar strumming. Predating stuff like Glenn Branca's guitar symphonies, Arnold Dreyblatt's ""sound of one string"" experiments, and even partner Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music by several years, this track is a murky, percussive sludgefest. Thundering on for about 11 minutes, it's an early and brilliant attempt at merging the sounds of rock with minimalism. Sadly, the poor sound quality of the tapes rears its head toward the song's end when the distorted guitars are unceremoniously stopped midstream by tape warble, segueing into the third and final track, ""The Second Fortress."" Though the only instrument credited on this last song is ""electronic sounds,"" it's actually Cale manipulating his Vox again, this time into a series of high-pitched drones. The sound here borders on the popular conception of minimalist music, with repetitious ambient textures. Gone are the obvious crammed-into-place keys and pressured sustain of ""Sun Blindness Music."" They've been replaced with the musician coaxing a shimmering series of drones out of his organ. The pulsating texture is still present, but the pace gives the impression of gliding along into soundscape territory as opposed to the fevered swells of the title track. For musical archaeologists, this disc is only the beginning of an archival dig. With two more discs to be released in the coming months, you'd think Table of the Elements had cornered the market on these historic minimalist documents. And they pretty much have. Along with the aforementioned Day of Niagara, there's also the scraping, extreme drones of Tony Conrad's Four Violins box set. Siltbreeze tried their hand at it, as well, and released a couple of highly recommended Angus Maclise recordings, The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda and Brain Damage in Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, La Monte Young is still sitting on a treasure chest of Theater of Eternal Music recordings, though the likelihood of them being released in the near future is minimal. Taken with everything else, the new Cale disc rests perfectly amongst the other historical documents. And although it stands well on its own, it would be a mistake to treat it as anything other than a vital component of the early minimalist and Dream Syndicate canons. Sun Blindness Music is a portrait of an artist engaged in the maturing process, actively seeking out new sounds while simultaneously breaking down barriers of the old. It's not always successful, but taken in conjunction with his VU work during the same period, it's clear that Cale aggressively and enthusiastically pursued new sound territories.","When John Cale's name is dropped, any number of things might pop into your head, but chances are, it ...

Zoo Sounds and Destructovision EP,Utah!,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f9c0084474cd0c0f51/1:1/w_160/2bea7317.gif,2001-10-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8375-zoo-sounds-and-destructovision-ep/,Arborvitae,"Hello! Welcome to the Pitchfork review of Zoo Sounds and Destructovision, the debut EP from Utah! Utah! are not actually from Utah! In fact, they hail from several thousand miles away, in Kalamazoo, Michigan! Amazing! The real Utah (no exclamation point) is full of nifty geological eccentricities like buttes, stone arches, and a big, salty lake called Great Salt Lake, and lots of Mormons live there! But the Utah! that I'm talking about here contains neither buttes nor arches, nor salty lakes, nor Mormons, so let there be no confusion! That said, let's talk about what Utah! does contain! Utah! consists of Eric Singer, who plays bass and baritone guitar (he doesn't sing, though), Eddie Pellino, who sings and plays guitar, Mickey D'Loughy, who hits some drums, and Anne Polesnak, who plays a mean cello, and sings a little bit! If you enjoy long walks through twisty instrumental passages, spending time with a sensitive male vocalist, and curling up in front of your computer to watch low-budget music videos about socially rejected robots, this CD may be the match for you! I'm getting sick of typing exclamation points, and you're likely sick of seeing them, so I'll stop now! Really, I promise! Zoo Sounds and Destructovision presents a band who wouldn't have to do a whole lot to go from being simply passable to being outstanding. For one thing, they're all skilled musicians-- this is obvious from the lengthy instrumental passages that find their way into every song. For the moment, though, the most interesting interplay is between the cello, bass, and drums. The guitar, however, hasn't quite found its place in the intertwining lines, preferring to grind away in a cloud of heavy fuzz in the background. This results in a texturally dense sound, which, though sometimes effective, often obscures the melodic substance of the songs, be it in the cello or the vocals. Indeed, Pellino's earnest vocals-- reminiscent of a young Jeremy Enigk or Joe Davis from the Pinehurst Kids-- often find themselves a little bit buried in the mix. It's not as though the melodies are that great, anyway, but being able to hear them better might help the listener remember them. The other reason these songs don't tend to stick is that, in the instrumental sections, the band as a whole is often too content to simply ride a groove without offering any melodic material over the top. Polesnak's cello occasionally begs comparisons to Hilary Soldati's outstanding work with Smart Went Crazy, but just as often, it kind of sits around with the other instruments, shooting the breeze and neglecting to entertain. Singer's basslines add the rubbery bottom that brings each song to life-- it's his elastic fretboard stylings that jumpstart ""The Boy Who Gave Away the Bomb"" and ""Babette's Areola,"" interlocking with D'Loughy's frenetic drumming perfectly. D'Loughy could best be described as a busy drummer, and man, does he like his snare! (Sorry!) There are songs on this EP where I swear he doesn't even use toms. In the context of Utah!'s music, though, his active style and heavy snare abuse work well to push the proceedings along. The snare also cuts through the dense, bass-heavy mix better than any other drum. And with that, we come to the part of the review where we discuss the disc's added value features. Yes, Utah! believe in giving you more for your money, and in this spirit, they have included a short film called ""Robot 2: You're Strange If You Know"" in the multimedia portion of this disc. Let me begin discussing this film by saying that I've read reviews of this EP which detail the existential ramifications of said film and speak of its power and meaning. This will not be one of those reviews. Rather, I'll mention the fact that the movie has a certain amateurish charm to it that's hard to deny, but it hardly bears more than one or two views. Essentially, it centers on a big, clunky, humanoid robot who tries to go to a concert being given by an especially heavy emo band in a dingy basement, and gets driven off by the band's fans (possibly because he's not emotional enough). He then attempts to join a card game at a party, but is again shunned by the human participants. He wanders back to the concert, where he headbangs for a bit (this is very amusing, by the way) and gets kicked out again. Despondent, he walks to the river and stares at the moon. He flashbacks to his birth. There are shots from the ground of men with blowtorches in surgical masks, while subtitles that plaintively ask, ""Why are they making me?"" fade in and out until the movie ends with a shot of our dejected hero sitting alone on the waterfront. The lesson we take away from this, of course, is that we should all be nicer to big, clunky robots. Because, after all, they just want to fit in. This moral should also apply to men dressed in big, clunky robot suits. They have feelings, too, you know. Overall, the movie is a cute diversion that adds little value to the package as a whole, but only provides amusement for a short time. As for the EP itself, Utah! definitely have an interesting sound that's worth exploring. With a little more focus on melody and some stronger songs, they have the potential to make a very interesting debut album. Unfortunately, Utah! haven't quite perfected their sound yet here, and it makes for a fairly unmemorable record. Here's hoping for more in the future!","Hello!

Change,The Dismemberment Plan,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14713d19756521385b6/1:1/w_160/a8dc9308.jpg,2001-10-23 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2339-change/,DeSoto,"Change is something fans of D.C.'s The Dismemberment Plan have grown accustomed to over the years, as the band has proven to make vast leaps in maturity with each album. Somewhere between the release of their clumsy 1995 debut, ""!"", and 1997's more balanced but no less raucous Is Terrified!, the band discovered the advantages of rock balladry and pensive lyrics. With 1999's Emergency & I, they hit their stride, recording a landmark underground classic which rocketed them-- almost overnight-- into the stratosphere of indie rock's elite. But when The Dismemberment Plan decided to title their new album Change, they weren't fucking around. After the primal energy and speak/singalong teenage anthems of Emergency & I, Change comes as a bit of a jolt. No longer intent on inciting dancefloor riots through funk-laden post-punk explosions, the new Dismemberment Plan is more reflective, more sentimental, and, perhaps shockingly, confidently collected. Whereas their last album cruised through 12 tracks with a pummeling frenzy that sent audiences into fits of unrestrained revelry, the band rarely kicks into overdrive on Change, instead pondering their place in the world and the prosaic nature of day-to-day life. That's right: they've settled down. There are few things more detested in youth than the inevitable mellowing that comes with age, so should the band be derided for gracefully succumbing to adulthood or applauded for refusing to grow stagnant? Obviously, it depends on the final product. And Change, while unquestionably more mature than anything The Dismemberment Plan have released in the past, is also, at times, an incredibly powerful record that can make mundane ruminations seem like Socratic philosophy. Of all indie rock's leading voices, few have a way with words like Plan frontman Travis Morrison. His hypnotic musings on everything from lonely New Year's celebrations in unfamiliar cities to nuclear decimation have always been an integral element of the band's sound and success. On Emergency & I, his lyrics blended with the electric onslaught to create visceral moments of uplift and sonic bliss. On Change, however, they've become the primary focus of the songs, with the band trading in raging vigor for polite, polyrhythmic grooves. The subjects of these songs lack some of the creativity of past works-- there are no memory machines to wash away the grief, no supernatural invitations from anyone to do anything-- but Morrison's uncanny ability to capture a moment in photographic detail has developed into poetic mastery. On one of the album's highlights, the stripped-bare ""Automatic"", he moans, ""I could see you through the dirty waves/ Smiling like a vampire as you disappeared beneath the whitecaps.../ I could feel my toes curl through the yellow sand/ As I watched you slip away."" On the bizarre ""Face of the Earth"", in which he contemplates the expression of a girlfriend just before she's unexpectedly and permanently sucked into the sky, he sings, ""I freeze the look of pre-alert and study it still/ Her smile starts to loosen/ Her pupils yawn wide."" And then there's the highly quotable line from what is far and away the album's clear standout, ""Time Bomb"": ""I am a time bomb/ And I only live in that one moment in which you die."" Though devoid of the urgency the band built their name on, Change is the most musically cohesive of The Dismemberment Plan's records to date. The album kicks off with ""Sentimental Man"", which bridges the gap between the Talking Heads' Remain in Light and Joni Mitchell's Court and Spark with drummer Joe Easley and bassist Eric Axelson forming a busy, aquatic undercurrent for the quiescent, drugged guitar and droning keyboard. The song flows seamlessly into ""Face of the Earth"", whose temperament is similarly mild-mannered until it opens up with blaring, Jawbox-esque guitar jangle. ""Superpowers"" is the first of the album's truly great tracks, documenting events witnessed through extra-sensory perception (""I've been cornered by the screams of a body as it freed itself of its mind""). ""Pay for the Piano"" harkens back to The Dismemberment Plan of old with surging guitars and that trademark wired dynamism that pulsed through the band's best songs. ""Come Home"" follows with what is-- next to the excellent ""Automatic""-- Change's quietest track. Unfortunately, where ""Automatic"" contains some of the album's best lyrics, ""Come Home"" is too self-pitying, and its lack of any melodic hook gets tired long before it stretches past the five-minute mark. The intensely rhythmic ""Secret Curse"" ushers in a welcome high point, though. The song embodies the fragile tenseness of anxiety as Morrison spits out words at a rate even record-holding typists couldn't transcribe (""Anonymous hex on flavorless food and terrible sex a day of no rhythm a night of no rest""). The lyrical misgivings of ""Following Through"" (most notably, the spine-shivering ""it could have been off the hook, now"") are redeemed by chiming guitar, heartbeat percussion, and a beautifully harmonized chorus. But Change closes on a less intriguing note with two songs: the jungle-flavored ""The Other Side"" and the story of ""Ellen and Ben"". Both songs pass with only minor complaints: the former, while one of the most musically creative songs in the band's catalog, suffers lyrically from a lack of any real point; the latter details the rise and fall of a romantic relationship through the eyes of a gossiping outsider. But even while these tracks are decent enough, they lack both the kinetic energy of the band's earlier material, and the engaging lyrical insight that dominates the rest of the record. So, yes. The Dismemberment Plan we once knew and loved has indeed changed, and like any change, it takes some getting used to. Initially, the tribal percussion and sometimes maudlin tone may not sit well. You might notice small imperfections, such as the mix, which seems slightly muddier this time out, or Morrison's emotive ""yeah's"" which can occasionally be a little abrasive. But with repeated listens, its positive traits-- like Easley's unbelievably creative drumming, Axelson's volatile basslines, and the richly textured keyboards-- begin to pile up, eventually outweighing its negatives tenfold. Sure, it's hard to shake that nagging feeling that it's too early in The Dismemberment Plan's career for this kind of shift, that they had so much more to explore in their endearingly spazzy rock vein. But metamorphosis can be a beautiful thing, and like the butterfly retains a part of the caterpillar, Change retains a part of the pre-mutated Dismemberment Plan. You see, they're still the same band they always were. They're just prettier now.","Change is something fans of D.C.'s The Dismemberment Plan have grown accustomed to over the years, as the ...

Enjoy Your Rabbit,Sufjan Stevens,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57113d1975652138f60/1:1/w_160/590bddaf.gif,2001-10-23 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7511-enjoy-your-rabbit/,Asthmatic Kitty,"It's all fine and dandy for a musician to dabble in widely divergent styles, combining and rearranging until something new in born. But there's a fine line between that and cashing in on a trend and letting market research be your guide. Unless your name is Serge Gainsbourg (who jumped in headfirst wherever his muse happened to lead him, bending whole genres to his will and overpowering them with his personality), it's best to not force it, and let things happen naturally. Given his first album was a collection of folky, singer-songwriterly musings and Sebadoh-inspired, bedroom-recorded alternative rockers, I was a little dubious at first of this second effort from Michigan-gone-New York composer/multi-instrumentalist Sufjan Stevens (who sometimes sits in with the Danielson Famile during their live shows). Enjoy Your Rabbit is a collection of electronic compositions, so my first impression was that it was the work of someone who just happened to have access to high-end software, some extra time on his hands, and a desire to see if he could stir up some TV commercial work-- all of which might be correct, but all questions of authenticity and motivations faded from memory about two minutes into the album. Such concerns are rendered trivial when confronted with such a fully realized piece of work. An IDM song-cycle based on Chinese astrological symbols-- or as the liner notes put it, ""programmatic songs for the animals of the Chinese Zodiac""-- Enjoy Your Rabbit explores a wide palette of electronic textures using few external samples. After a brief introductory track, we're hit with ""Year of the Monkey,"" which uses what sounds like a hyper-modified Atari battling a supped-up Colecovision in a chess match/battle royal. Microchips fly everywhere as a thunderous, crashing piledriver of a beat smashes them both to bits. Like its namesake, it's playfully mischievous, with a hint of violence always lurking nearby. ""Year of the Rat"" follows, starting like a classic Eno piece before squalling feedback undercuts the theme while the song turns into background music for the next Toy Story movie and returns to its introductory theme. ""Year of the Boar"" is frantic with its pin-sharp wind-chime notes scattering across an organic bongo beat, and ending in an ascending faux-guitar solo coda. With ""Year of the Tiger,"" a human voice pops up for the first time atop the sound of circuitry covering the earth like kudzu, ending in an aggressive death rattle. By contrast, ""Year of the Snake"" is almost hymnal with its organ drone, but for the recoiling flashes of short-circuitry and sing-songy bells near the end. The standout track comes with ""Year of the Dragon."" At 9\xBD minutes, Stevens gives himself some room to stretch out. If the other songs have a fault, it's that they cram to much into such small containers. Here, Stevens allows a marching beat to hang around long enough for him to weave in a subtle, yet soaring soundscape. ""Enjoy Your Rabbit"" (replacing the expected title of ""Year of the Rabbit"") is the most conventionally song-oriented track, with a distorted guitar melody line leading much of the way, and even what could be called a recurrent riff. Elsewhere, the rubbery and fluid ""Year of the Dog"" sounds inspired by 70s Stevie Wonder and other bouncy funk; ""Year of the Horse"" rounds out the zodiac with a long piano-driven romp through futuristic gothic architecture; and the album final track, ""Year of Our Lord,"" closes the record with ambient meditation. Taken in one lump dose, Enjoy Your Rabbit can be a bit intimidating as it's almost 80 minutes long, and at times it does sound like electronica-for-entry-level-listeners due to its sheer breadth of styles. But Sufjan Stevens proves himself adept of both long and short forms; downtempo and high BPM; glitches, scratches and ambient drones; blips, bleeps and bloops. I'm looking forward to seeing where he goes from here.","It's all fine and dandy for a musician to dabble in widely divergent styles,\n\ combining and rearranging until ...

Pia,Takagi Masakatsu,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c413d197565213bde0/1:1/w_160/b1fd5777.gif,2001-10-23 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5127-pia/,Carpark,"Capitalism's latest affront on human intelligence: oxygen bars. Just when we thought designer water had pushed consumerism to the limits of its frivolity, someone discovered they could sell air by putting it in a fancy package. I guess we should have seen it coming. For years, the same faux-connoisseurs have been thronging to Starbucks, throwing their money away on factory-made café-culture aesthetics, attractive branding and ""gourmet"" coffee. Marketing weasels can dress anything up in a clever wrapper and reap enormous profits from America's undiscriminating public. Hardly anybody knows what good coffee tastes like, much less good water or air-- people pay for the illusion of sophistication, and seldom for the product itself. The world of IDM is not immune to this phenomenon. The recent proliferation of laptop jockeys has left a lot less room in the genre for innovation, and the result has been an interminable output of insipid, uninspired rot. This is not to say that nothing good has come out of leftfield electronica in the last several years; just that it's been imitated ad nauseum, and some listeners don't know enough to draw the line between the originators and the pretense. Takagi Masakatsu's Pia, an innocuous atmospheric excursion in the vein of Pete Namlook's FAX label, is the sonic equivalent of canned air. There's really nothing of substance here, but the void is concealed by elegant production and the hallmark inaccessibility of electronic minimalism. This may suffice to satisfy simpler audiences, and I wouldn't be surprised if elsewhere this album met with critical acclaim. Minimalism is, after all, en vogue right now. But I can't get past this record's vapid predictability. This album operates on a conventional formula in ambient music, layering digitally processed light white noise over ethereal synth pads and played out samples. Masakatsu runs through the entire catalog of stock new-age sounds-- running water, a rooster crowing, chirping birds and talking children. Don't forget the talking children. Nothing suggests artistic enlightenment like talking children. Occasionally, Pia reaches beyond mediocrity. ""Bienna,"" with its strangely inverted refrain and intricate stereo manipulation, recalls latter-day Fennesz. It's a far cry from original, but at least challenges the listener at a more thoughtful level than the rest of the album. ""Guiter"" introduces a stronger element of musical structure, spreading soft, coherent melodies over percussive jolts of static. But the rest of the album scrolls by like a nebulous grey mass of experimental cliches. Pianos, sounds from nature, self-indulgent moments of contemplation and profundity-- you name it, it's probably here. And I hope I haven't forgotten to mention the talking children, who crop up on a total of three songs (""Eau,"" ""Videocamera"" and ""Caroc""). The package comes with an additional disc of ""enhanced media,"" which features five audio/video pieces created by Masakatsu. The pieces are of a similar minimalist nature in many respects, and have apparently been presented in Japanese art galleries. But while these pieces are pleasing enough aesthetically, I can't picture myself sliding it into my CD-ROM drive very often. Pia, in all of its inoffensive tedium, would certainly be at home on the speakers of an oxygen bar. It works fine as wallpaper-- too understated to scare anyone off, too abstract to be readily transparent. But any judicious listener who subjects this record to sincere scrutiny will find that it comes up lamentably shallow.","Capitalism's latest affront on human intelligence: oxygen bars.

P.S. You Love Me,Kid606,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb84ea9e61561daa7266/1:1/w_160/275790a4.gif,2001-10-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4408-ps-you-love-me/,Mille Plateaux,"Oval's Markus Popp was busy with collaborations between '95 and '99. His remixes for the likes of Tortoise, Pizzicato 5 and Ryuichi Sakamoto were consistently intriguing-- his musical voice was unique and his process was radically different from what was used to generate the source material. My favorite from this era remains his remix of Takako Minekawa's ""International Velvet,"" which wound up on her collection, Ximer. Throwing the high, chirpy voice of Minekawa into sharp relief, Popp buried the instrumentation under an avalanche of processing, saturating the tapes with data to such a degree that they seemed to transform into some sort of post-organic being. Popp's mixes then were so distinctive because they were atom-smashing collisions of opposing forces-- digital vs. analog, played vs. processed-- that wound up generating an original compound. Last year, Kid606 made an entry into the ambient glitch world of Mille Plateaux with P.S. I Love You. With that album, the Kid proved to the world that he had processing and compositional skills to rank him amongst the heavy hitters of the genre. Either that, or he proved that glitch music was easy to make. In any case, it was a varied and rewarding collection, that showed him touching on dub (""Together""), reflective drone music (""Sometimes""), and click&cut; techno (""Whereweleftoff"") with success. So now we have the obligatory remix effort, P.S. You Love Me, which features five new Kid606 tracks and was compiled in part from two previously released EPs. It's a solid collection, but ultimately suffers a bit because the remixers come from a similar aesthetic background and don't seem to be challenging themselves or the original track. Compare P.S. You Love Me to Microstoria's Reprovisors and you can see the opportunity lost. The latter was wildly variable, with a fascinating vocal-meets-laptop contribution from Stereolab, a full-band take from Ui, some traditional instrumental fuckery from Jim O'Rourke, and Markus Popp's crowning achievement (his Microstoria megamix ""Runtime Engine""). P.S. You Love Me, while good, is simply glitch music remixed by glitch artists. Failure to reach for the stars is not a crime, though, so it would be best to assess P.S. You Love Me on its own merits. Somewhat predictably, I'm going to have to say that my favorite cut is Jan Jelinek's ""Kubuki Rock Mix"" of ""Sometimes,"" contributed under his Farben alias. The German intellectual with an ear for the sublime didn't waste an opportunity to play with the most outwardly beautiful track on P.S. I Love You. The original drone is processed heavily, sometimes serving as a background tone as Jelinek fills the near field with his trademark clicks and pitch shifts, other times elbowing its way to the fore to display its shimmering warmth. Matmos also contribute a winner-- a funky technofied take on ""Twirl"" that finds them incorporating the sounds of an interview they gave while simultaneously working on the remix. Despite how tossed-off that sounds, they do a nice job accelerating the rhythmic punch of the original's guitar samples and transforming the tune into something danceable. Tracks by Atom, Twerk and Rechenzentrum are all nice minimal techno (Atom's verges on excellent), but not the sort of thing I return to often. The best of the rest are the five new tracks. ""Act Your Age"" is one of the more melodic tracks Kid606 has released in this vein, with patient deployment of a mysterious music box tune. ""Horseback"" dabbles in the drones of ""Sometimes"" with a more sinister edge, while ""P.S. I Dub Ya/Posterboys of the Apocalypse"" is a punishing house track that combines elements of several pieces. P.S. You Love Me is a worthwhile companion to the Kid's earlier record, but the tracks never quite click (so to speak) in that way that gets you staring at the disc player in wonder. The talent involved here is evident, but as an album, P.S. You Love Me lacks tension.","Oval's Markus Popp was busy with collaborations between '95 and '99.

A Difficult Future,Timeout Drawer,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7afb1335d7bf16990e4/1:1/w_160/4c4dfc0e.gif,2001-10-22 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8061-a-difficult-future/,Some Odd Pilot,"Not a closet. Not a corner. The Timeout Drawer, for God's sake. Just how bad do you have to be to get stuffed in there? It's hard to think of the band in terms of punishment, because their sound is far from transgressive. These four guys might get tossed in the post-rock pile, but what they make is unabashed space-rock, although not in the abstract jam-band sense. They soak their instrumentals in dense synthesizer tones. They feed their guitars through a thicket of effects pedals. And if the smooth results don't sound much like the future, well, it's because the celestial paths were first explored in the 1970s. A Difficult Future begins with electronic piano chords hinting at soulfulness, like the opening of Belle and Sebastian's ""Don't Leave the Light On, Baby."" But then, in washes the monolithic Moog. The prog-dwellers and krautrockers of the 70s shared a simple secret: analog synth, with that slight delay in the decay of its notes, sure sounds great when you're under the influence. And so the Timeout Drawer continue in that vein, each song buzzing and burping in harmonies that would cue reminiscent tears (or flashbacks!) for old Hawkwind fans. You can hear traces of descendants of the sound, too, especially when bass, guitar and keyboards converge in epic choruses, conjuring up the overwrought sincerity of Signals-era Rush. For contemporaries, think Air's Virgin Suicides score, the best Pink Floyd album never made. The technical proficiency of the musicians is near flawless. For nearly an hour, they weave layers of drones, distortion and the clarion call of their synths into a seamless mix. But for all the rocking numbers, there are also moments when the sentimentality of a melody becomes cloying. They don't quite breach Vangelis territory, but ""His Sailing Days Are Over But He Can't Forget the Sea,"" for instance, wouldn't sound out of place in a planetarium's laser light show. And ""Finding a Place in the Sun"" could be the soundtrack to Star Hustler! I can just hear that guy's voice now: ""When the moon reaches its apex, we're going to lie in the penumbra, eat some of these fabulous magic mushrooms I found, and listen to the Timeout Drawer. You should really come along!"" The Timeout Drawer used to have a singer. I can't imagine that hearing his vocals would have dramatically altered my perspective on the band. But lyrics might have added a human dimension to a group whose sound otherwise emits a sterile neutrality, as if radiated from the Nebula of the Ever-Present, All-Encompassing Soup of the Universe. In the end, you wonder what (if anything) these songs mean, or how you're supposed to feel about the whole affair. At its worst, A Difficult Future exhibits all the post-rock-extra-lite tendencies of schlock like Tristeza and the Album Leaf. But at their best, these fellows make extremely competent, mercurial compositions that don't flinch away from their retro stylings. Here's to a future that never happened.","Not a closet.

Distance and Clime,Centro-matic,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56fc0084474cd0c0708/1:1/w_160/2bbf7f15.gif,2001-10-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1378-distance-and-clime/,Idol,"Guided by Voices: an American rock band who became the standard bearer for lo-fi in the early 90s with Robert Pollard's home recordings. Pollard created a Picasso-like sense of unfinished masterpieces through what seemed to be drunken toss-offs. The clear affection GBV held for the Beatles, coupled with a melodic sense all their own, created a sound with all the deconstructive energy of punk, yet the melodicism of 60s pop. Flaming Lips: Eccentric neo-psychedelic guitar band, with a singer who sounds like Neil Young gargling glue. Their sound evolved into bombastic prog-rock of epic proportions on their heralded 1999 album The Soft Bulletin. I know that, unlike the obsessive staff of Pitchfork, you, the reader, might not have heard these rather seminal indie bands. But I understand. There's a hell of a lot of music out there being called ""essential."" There are a slew of great books you need to read as well. Sadly, it's costly and time consuming, and you suspect they might not be as enjoyable as the experts make them out to be. These are valid concerns. That's one reason why I've bored the experts with my descriptions of these two bands, which, when combined and diluted of some twee, approach the sound of Centro Matic. The other reason is that I don't have much else to say about this Texas band. They sound like Lips singer Wayne Coyne fronting a tighter version of GBV. There's nothing much else that grabs me. But I'll go on. Watch: The songs on Distance and Clime, Centro-Matic's sixth full-length album, seem to be quality when I hear them, but I can never sing them back. The rhythm section is wonderfully invisible, propelling the songs like the Fantastic Four's Susan Storm. Will Johnson's guitar buzzes like a thousand bees, but as singer, he often lingers in misshapen triplets over his three syllable words, as if he's a little too in love with the smartness of his cryptic verses. It's a little hard to understand what the words ""in his pantlegs are hidden the blueprints to the stripmalls and the bloodbanks"" (from ""Janitorial on Channel Fail"") might mean, but Johnson caresses them like an ancient incantation. At least he doesn't sneer them all tongue-in-cheek, or try to be British like Robert Pollard. I can't stress how important it is that this band isn't twee, a worthy accomplishment given their influences. Instead of mimicking pre-schoolin' little boys, Johnson's opts for grittier vocals; instead of sing-songy, joyous melodies, they infuse the sound with a ballsy rock roar.

Owls,Owls,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba289d034d5c69bf53c4/1:1/w_160/ae7b43bf.jpeg,2001-10-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6073-owls/,Jade Tree,"Indie Rock is Important. No city embodies that tragicomic claim like Chicago. Thrill Jockey-- the silly coven of haughty and eminently geeky indie-rockers with unbearable jazz pretensions and its arsenal of post-every-fucking-thing-under-the-sun nomenclature-- has consistently been the most egregious of the Second City's many labels vying for real-life importance, your serious esteem, and of course, CD and show-ticket dollars. But while the über-musicianly Sir John McEntire and his Knights of Bucktown have been out wielding Powerbooks, Kinsella(s) Inc. has been steadily building an empire of pretension. Sometimes tickling the critics into embarrassing coos of honeyed admiration, and other times inspiring equally disproportionate rock-crit fatwas, Tim Kinsella has succeeded where other Illini have failed: in disarming the full fury of his detractors with nothing more than a smirk. I'm not talking, of course, about Kinsella's actual countenance; I'm referring to his neo-absurdist temperament and the obvious fun with which he goes about his business. Even when he was just the scratchy-voiced, baby-faced ringmaster of Cap'n Jazz, Tim Kinsella was already establishing himself as a first- (well, maybe second) rate semantic clown and word-gamesman. With a penchant for double-entendre and imagistic jokes, Kinsella charmed his partisans and alienated the rest of us with his Duchampesque disregard for everything, and created a contested little body of work which still polarizes fans of the genre. Personally, Joan of Arc drives me up the fucking wall, but my dismissal of the band has nothing to do with the personality phenomenon of Kinsella; they sorely lacked dynamism, and there were too few hooks and too much blipped-over space for my liking. Owls reunites the boys from Cap'n Jazz for another stab at the rock. Abthent thith time ith the Promith Ring'th Davey Von Bohlen, but the remaining cast (Tim Kinsella, brother Mike on drums, guitarist Victor Villareal, and bassist Sam Zurick) are back in strong form. So, too, is Tim Kinsella's jokiness, though that's not such a bad thing. Even the typical, hideously Kinsellated title of ""What Whorse You Wrote Id On"" doesn't detract from the opening track's elegant mood and almost sing-songy warmth. The guitarwork is nothing short of gorgeous, with Villareal arpeggiating a trebly, spidery path into your aural memory, his picking providing a textural counterpoint to Mike Kinsella's ornate drumming, which it should be said has never sounded this good. ""Anyone Can Have a Good Time"" starts quietly and jangly over a semi-marshal beat in non-standard time. Things seem to be meandering, only to find anchorage in what passes for a refrain. The tonally challenged Kinsella spits tick-tocky syllables over one more verse, and after a pleasant mood shift and instrumental interlude, the song's end-section begins. ""We fall into patterns quickly/ We fall into patterns too quickly,"" sings a background Tim Kinsella, as a forefront one screams, ""Unname everybody/ Unname everyone,"" in emo bursts of surprisingly well-hit notes as the song peters out. ""Life in the Hair Salon Themed Bar on the Island"" (an apparent reference to Beauty Bar on 14th St. in New York City), is the proggiest of the album's tracks. That is to say, it sounds like indie rock interpreting Frank Zappa influences from something they read in a book. The standout comes with the subsequent song, ""I Want the Blidingly Cute to Confide in Me."" It encapsulates many of the album's disparate, yet weirdly integrated, strains: its faux-jazzy rhythm excursions, its Andy Summers-on-crack guitar playing, the intermittently truly beautiful vocal melodies, and of course, Kinsella's lyrical shots in the dark. Owls' music is an odd concoction of opposing and random musical and emotional trajectories. You can hear echoes of Cap'n Jazz and, every bit as clearly, some really weird ""adult contemporary"" musical phrases, too. The mélange works very well enough, though, and hits the mute button on the death knell so many would like sound on Kinsella's oddly resilient and shapeshifting career. Goddamnit.","Indie Rock is Important. No city embodies that tragicomic claim like Chicago.\n\ Thrill Jockey-- the silly coven of haughty ...

Put Your Gloves On and Wave,Halifax Pier,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c04613d197565213ba0b/1:1/w_160/5f6ef337.gif,2001-10-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3718-put-your-gloves-on-and-wave/,Temporary Residence,"Last year's self-titled record from Halifax Pier delivered melancholy to all who would listen, with a violinist and a cellist added to the standard rock quartet of two guitarists, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in the musical conversations of the music. While Halifax Pier hasn't completely rid themselves of their despair, they seem to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore full-length, Put Your Gloves On and Wave, are instrumentals, and the songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999 self-titled debut. ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an all-together-now sing-along taken from a Chris Williamson song, ""Song of the Soul."" It's fairly uplifting stuff. ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely. Opening with the sound of a distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of Greg Burns are eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point, the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse, in which frontman Charles Sommer's vocals are echoed by guest Colleen Doyle: ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight."" ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with a meandering conversation between the cello and violin. The drum and light electric guitar enter to reveal a dark waltz. The euphonious harmonic ornaments of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than grizzly. Then there's ""Sew Your Gloves On,"" which features sections in seven. The track is slightly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more coherent moments, when they're not so damned consumed with the collapse of modern society. And finally, the album closes with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering track that feels closer to something from the Windham Hill collection than anything remotely indie rock. So, yeah. Halifax Pier makes pretty music. While it's rarely emotionally consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does make for a calming listen. What more do you want? It's nice.","Last year's self-titled record from Halifax Pier delivered melancholy to all who would listen, with a violinist and a ...

Bless You,The Court & Spark,by: Christopher F.

In the 70s, there was Led Zeppelin's offering of a whole lotta love, a stairway to heaven, and a facile Kashmir eclecticism. In the 80s, there was cock rock, hair bands and countless groupies. One must hand it to University of Chicago's Allan Bloom, who in 1987 put forth an accurate, yet jaded, generalization on the role of popular music: ""A pubescent child whose body throbs with orgasmic rhythms; whose feelings are made articulate in hymns to the joys of onanism or the killing of parents whose ambition is to win fame and wealth in imitating the drag-queen who makes the music. In short, life is made into a nonstop, commercially prepackaged masturbational fantasy."" While his statement is gargantuan in presumption, it could be said that the mainstream music of the time often bequeathed an overbalanced self-assuredness in the listener. But as my fourth grade teacher aptly stated: change is inevitable. When Kurt Cobain was thrown the reigns in 1991, the new hero wasn't sexual, clean, or a monster of rock. This demigod had feelings ranging from angst to alienation (okay, not that great a divide, admittedly) and rarely came across as completely sure of himself. And with the death of Cobain came the eulogy of genuine rock bombast. Above ground lie a vast assortment of commercial-quality pop and trite modern rock radio, all sans ingenuity or sincere emotion. Underground, there are the emo kids, the shoegazers, the art dilettantes, anti-everything punks, and dozens of elitist music cliques. Where is one to belong? Perhaps the question is not where to belong but whether to belong at all. Thus we have the nature of no depression, and its many bands who are routinely pigeonholed as country. And on initial exposure, such a classification is justified. But at the end of the day, no depression is not your uncle's John Michael Montgomery. Consider the description of San Francisco's the Court and Spark as found in the biography on their website: ""The Court & Spark is a slow-fade, a slow-klang, a climb to the top of Portola Road to watch San Francisco on the longest day of the year."" I may have never been to San Francisco, but this statement can not be denied. In fact, the Court & Spark's sophomore collection, Bless You, introduces itself in a slow-klang. A simple bass snare pattern in two slowly ambles its way to the listener, accompanied by unorthodox percussion and a sound resembling the plucking and strumming of piano strings before the full band enters. The track, ""To See the Fires,"" presents a comprehensive view of the Court & Spark's terrain: slide guitar (only sometimes lap-steel), the addition of Wendy Allen to sing harmony full-time, organ, piano, and southern tinged vocals. But don't be fooled. You are not listening to country. Bless You's musical affect is akin to the feeling evoked by the ruddy sunset depicted on the back cover of the record: approaching peace and grasping utter beauty. The eight gorgeous minutes of the penultimate ""Fade Out to Little Arrow"" are augmented by very light horns that ring more like distant church bells on a Sunday evening. The upbeat tambourine shuffle of ""Rooster Mountain"" complements the most infectious yet bittersweet track. Such a feat is achieved by a very slamming snare sound, resembling a large crowd of impeccably synchronized handclaps, and droning horn leading the bridge back to the verse. What makes Bless You so intriguing is the effectiveness of such subtle ornaments. Wendy Allen proves yet again, with her backing vocals on ""National Lights,"" that sometimes the most subtle of performances can be the best. Here, she echoes the vocals of frontman M.C. Taylor and occasionally adds a light falsetto. The song is seemingly standard fare on the surface, but the Court & Spark have almost mastered their art. The burbling organs of ""A.M. Radio"" lie underneath the entire track, while it climbs between male and female vocals to cymbal crashes and a driving guitar line. ""I have seen the driving rain,"" reflect Allen and Scott Hirsch. But they don't need to tell us; we can hear it ourselves. The Court & Spark don't consider themselves country, so neither should we. Perhaps no depression is the best description: the melodies and performances are mostly plaintive while never being altogether downcast. Their last album, 2000's tUMULt-released Ventura Whites, documented a band gathering their bearings; Bless You presents a band that's almost settled into their identity. They have their tools and have realized the power of subtlety, something the gods of rock from yestercentury tended to completely disregard.","Lament the demise of the rock juggernaut.

The Argument,Fugazi,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be59abf31b7dc715612f/1:1/w_160/55850474.jpg,2001-10-21 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3242-the-argument/,Dischord,"This past January, I was one of a few hundred lucky individuals jammed into the sweaty confines of the Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge, Massachusetts, checking out a triple bill of excellent bands: local roof-raisers Cracktorch, jazz-rockers Karate, and the indomitable Dismemberment Plan. About halfway through their set, the Plan stopped for a brief break between songs and Travis Morrison, ever the insightful one, took a moment to acknowledge the fact that the intersection outside the club had been christened Mark Sandman Square, after the late Morphine frontman. Applause erupted in honor of our local hero, a man who did a great deal of work to help strengthen Boston's now-vibrant music scene in the mid-90s. Morrison went on to muse that perhaps there would one day be an Ian MacKaye Circle in Washington D.C., countering some initial laughter with the assertion that nations like the Netherlands and Belgium are doing a better job of celebrating our rich musical legacy than we are, erecting statues in honor of Charlie Parker and John Coltrane in their squares. Those comments have stuck with me, and I've come to think that it's a really good idea-- MacKaye and Fugazi have been a major cultural force in the last decade. They're worthy of public accolades. Over the course of seven albums (counting Instrument and 13 Songs), they've plied a brand of brutal, often Spartan post-punk that's never catered to fashion, while at the same time garnering a large, devoted fanbase that sends their albums into the Billboard Top 200 without the benefit of major label backing or radio airplay. Of course, one primary obstacle to a public memorial for the members of Fugazi is the band's collective politics which, while moralistic and anti-corporate, are hardly anti-capitalist as many have claimed. In fact, the band has fairly been living the American dream, becoming successful on their own terms without losing the rights to their music or creative direction. They've also taken an active role in positioning their label, Dischord, at the fore of the indie pack; over the years, the label has become the most reliable source of hard-hitting post-punk around. The Argument, Fugazi's first proper album since 1998's somewhat disjointed End Hits, is yet another leap forward for a band that has constantly pushed itself in new directions. For one thing, no Fugazi album has ever been this melodic. For the first time ever, you can hum at least part of the melody to every song on the record. As catchy as they sometimes were, you have to admit that whistling ""Bed for the Scraping"" or ""Sieve-Fisted Find"" was never really a prospect. The album opens with an untitled bit of collage that marries static and police radio transmissions to Amy Domingues' brooding cello drones, immediately setting The Argument apart from the band's past work, before ""Cashout"" makes the thoroughness of the transition even more apparent. Domingues' cello carries counter-melodies to MacKaye's double-tracked singing throughout the song, which itself is a sort of post-hardcore update of the Kinks' ""Muswell Hillbilly."" MacKaye details a series of evictions as the city takes an apartment complex by eminent domain to make room for a development. After spending so many years screaming their sentiments in your ear, it's nice to see that Fugazi have come to a point where they don't necessarily feel the need to raise their voices to put their point across. Joe Lally and Brendan Canty throw down a furious groove on ""Full Disclosure"" to support Guy Picciotto's demented wailing (""I want a mutually assured destructive life"") amid screaming guitar interplay. It's excellent, but it's nothing we haven't heard Fugazi do before, until the second verse, where Lally, Picciotto, and MacKaye enter in three-part harmony. The juxtaposition between shockingly smooth vocals (for Fugazi, anyway), and the jagged rhythmic interplay is extremely effective. The energy level stays high on ""Epic Problem,"" as MacKaye delivers his lines telegram-style, complete with shouts of ""Stop!"" between lines, which the band dutifully obeys. ""And inside I know I'm broken/ But I'm working as far as you can see,"" he sings in the guitar and voice breakdown near the song's end, a section that serves to highlight the fact that this is Fugazi's most produced effort yet. ""Life and Limb,"" ""The Kill,"" and ""Strangelight"" form the album's tense, even spooky backbone, with a focus on melody and intertwining guitar parts, as well as full production that recalls the sound of some of Red Medicine's more ambitious moments. Picciotto's creepy rallying cry of, ""Viva viva viva life and limb"" on ""Life and Limb"" is possibly his subtlest vocal ever, and the guitars buzz like a bees' nest that you know is somewhere nearby, but can't quite locate. There's a nervous tension in the song that energizes like the band's raging bulls from their early days. The cello in the coda of ""Strangelight"" reminds me, of all things, of the Renaissance prog of the Electric Light Orchestra's ultra-bizarre first album, No Answer, though the similarity ends with the cello. The coda also incorporates some dark piano phrases, making for one of Fugazi's most interesting timbrel moments yet. This leads into ""Oh,"" a slow anti-globalization anthem that stands out as the only song on the album that doesn't really satisfy. Thankfully, ""Ex-Spectator,"" one of several songs that benefits from the contributions of second drummer Jerry Busher, quickly redeems things with charging rhythms and more haywire guitar interplay. MacKaye shouts the lines, ""Looking out for cars and mortality/ Trying to find some sort of geometry/ Avoiding mistakes/ Keep an eye on every step I take,"" with the same unbridled aggression he used to make such good use of back when Fugazi were still making a name for themselves. The galloping punk undertow of ""Nightstop"" supports what may be the best song here, and the band even makes room for a restlessly strummed acoustic guitar in the mix. There also appears to be some heavily EQ'd guitar tapping after the second verse. It displays technical prowess without descending into the depths of wankery that so many equally skilled musicians might find themselves in. ""The Argument"" actually sets itself up to be a disappointing closer, with some somewhat questionable stop/start rhythms and a wandering melody, but it picks up after a curious ambient interlude, blasting to a close with a furious swirl of ragged guitar, cymbals, and rumbling bass. Fugazi have made a career out of crafting excellent albums, and with The Argument, they've made one of their best. At this point, I don't see it edging out Red Medicine or 13 Songs from the top of my Fugazi album hierarchy, but it's certainly a worthy entry into their catalog, and proves that they're still one of the most important bands in the world. The dedication of Ian MacKaye Circle may still be a pipe dream, but that doesn't mean that he and the other members of Fugazi don't deserve the honor.","This past January, I was one of a few hundred lucky individuals jammed into the sweaty confines of the Middle ...

The Mission Statement,S.I. Futures,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e95e6ef9596932074e/1:1/w_160/cf91c781.gif,2001-10-21 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7135-the-mission-statement/,Novamute,"Si Begg, a mechanical man of many monikers, adds another to his collection. It's obviously not sufficient that Begg has also been known as Buckfuck 3000, Cabbageboy, and Bigfoot; he now prefers S.I. Futures. Under this guise, Begg's techno and electro-funk poke fun at conventioneering and shareholder meetings. Quite why he's chosen such targets for his satire is not clear to me. Does he object to the great and the good of Proctor and Gamble coming together to discuss investment strategy and revenue streams? And why does Begg consider dance music a viable saber with which to lay into these things? In the absence of even the vaguest of answers, I'll state that the tracks here are sufficiently well put together to stand apart from such distractions. After all, Begg's proven strengths have always been his appreciation and execution of dancefloor mechanics, not his ability to deliver a withering critique of corporate hospitality. So away from concerns about Begg's secondary motivation, how does the music really fare? Well, if you haven't been absorbing the Plump DJs' frenzied cuts, the filthy electrofunk on the pioneering UK Botchit and Scarper label, or Rennie Pilgrim's equally innovative TCR Records, you'll be mildly impressed. The Mission Statement pushed Novamute one step further away from pure Berlin/Detroit techno, and closer to the applied mechanics of breakbeat-enhanced funk. This new direction began with Luke Slater's Wireless and continued in a more abstract fashion with Cristian Vogel's Rescate 137. Unfortunately for Begg, Slater and Vogel arrived first on this block and they brought something fresh. Begg, in turn, now presents us with what many others have become accustomed to. The guy also hasn't done himself any favors by releasing The Mission Statement so soon after the Leaf Label put out his Complete Death of Cool compilation, on which Begg focused on similarly fractured, jokey beats. As a result, The Mission Statement sounds as though Begg has retrieved leftovers from those sessions and presented them to Novamute as fresh sounds. After a daft spoken word intro about this disc being ""another quality S.I. Futures project,"" Begg slaps down the M/A/R/R/S-emulating ""This is the Way."" This opener gives me no way out from unfavorably contrasting it with ""New and Different Experiment,"" one of his nostalgic tweakings of the Beat Street sound on The Complete Death of Cool. Before long, its cuts, scratches, and synth cowbells get dropped for ""I Like That (Brand New)"" which features scene-stalwart, T-Power (aka Marc Royal). Royal has been on the UK jungle/breakbeat since the beginning. His first release in 1991, under the Bass Selective alias, foreshadowed the raw techno that evolved into jungle. As T-Power, his debut album, The Self-Evident Truth of an Intuitive Mind, blended the raga ruffness of Shy FX and UK Apache's ""Original Nuttah"" with avant jazz and a vast appreciation for experimental music. After parting ways with jungle music and the S.O.U.R label, Royal goofed around as Chocolate Weasel on Ninja Tune's dime. Since then, Royal has become the dependable axis around which the immensely successful Botchit and Scarper turns. Royal's manky beats and unmatched understanding of electro-dynamics have made him a highly sought after remixer and collaborator. Working with Begg on ""I Like That,"" however, brings little distinction to either party. The track hinges on crackle-caked snares and dapples of nervy atmospherics. The ""I Like That"" sample that is supposed to bind the track which obviously hasn't got the strength to hold this disjointed series of soundfiles together. The atmospheric elements too often break up the rhythm, rendering the track either a brief drop-in for DJs or an irritating spliff symphony. Begg enlists the hip-hop collective Aspects for ""All Terrain Aspects."" The trippy flute lines and sparse beats could have made the track a fave for bowl-packers. But the concrete-bound, stilted Aspects crew solidify the track's innate fluidity. Begg, in turn, resorts to vocoding them, showing how desperate he is to give the track some vitality. Plus, UK hip-hop has far better crews than Aspects. Roots Manuva could have made this cut a crucial joint. In a reference to the trains that pass through the Channel Tunnel, ""Eurostar"" connects The Mission Statement with 1998's Commuter World, Begg's travelogue-ish documentation of commuter habits and suburban attitudes. However, ""Eurostar"" relies too heavily on Belgium's poorly imaged facsimile of Kraftwerk, Telex, to compete with the virtuoso command of form and function that hallmarked Commuter World. The closing track and single, ""We are Not a Rock Band,"" is similarly hampered by Begg's appropriation of Telex's dopey moves. For every unqualified success (e.g. the growling, theremin-led fear of ""Assault on Precinct 14"" or the mutant sub-bass jungle of ""Ionic Funk"") Begg lets us down with derivative idiocies such as ""The News"" or ""Freestyle Disco,"" a steroid-scarfing remake of ""Gym and Tonic,"" Bob Sinclair's filter disco sampling of Jane Fonda's workout tapes. I find it useful to compare The Mission Statement with Commuter World. Both are concept-driven albums. The difference between them is unmistakable, though. Commuter World was insatiable in its appropriation of styles; Begg never fumbled as he traveled from blunted beats and collages of passengers' conversations to Orb-inspired ambient house/jungle through to hard, unforgiving techno. For The Mission Statement, Begg applies similar rigor only to the album's artwork. Had Begg spent an equal amount of time on the music as he did on the presentation of his conceit, The Mission Statement would have had a defining and winning purpose. But like 99% of company mission statements, Begg's is a collection of threadbare cliches, knackered phrases and cursory will-this-do's.","Si Begg, a mechanical man of many monikers, adds another to his collection.

Visitor Jim,Visitor Jim,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96213d197565213985f/1:1/w_160/afb745dc.gif,2001-10-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8478-visitor-jim/,Fortune,"As if the novelty of having an entire band-- albeit a trio-- named Jim wasn't enough of an ""angle"" for DIY self-promotion, this San Francisco band has tacked on a whole maritime mythos to go along with the music. Nevermind that the lyrical content has little to do with the briny deep or the nautical residents thereof. That didn't stop the Jims from decorating their release with images of deep sea diving suits, or writing a backstory about mutinous sea creatures invading the terra firma, to spread their musical message of pop-rock purism and equal rights for zoo plankton everywhere. Weirdos. The key Jim here is veteran Bay-area songwriter Jim Greer who displays a mastery over the pop song form shared by the likes of Andy Partridge, Eric Burdon and Tom Petty. With three albums of his own behind him, as well as stints in Dr. Octagon and Tipsy, it's easy to get the feeling that Visitor Jim could be just a project band for him, with the other members merely along for the joyride. Especially since the fuel that tends to drive these songs is Greer's well-established m.o.: catchy, hooky melodies with one foot in left-field. It hardly matters, though. Whether just a project, or Greer's main vehicle for future expression, Visitor Jim provides the medium for smart, electrified pop. ""Place of My Own"" is the third song on the disc and the first true sign that a detail-oriented approach to pop songwriting can generate some pleasing results. Acoustic guitar, 60s organ, gentle harmonies and atmospheric drumming (first time I've ever used that phrase) gel into a perfect mid-tempo three minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Two songs later enters ""Kill that Jungle"" with its bouncy, off-kilter melody and crunching, anthemic guitars. A quirky, memorable chorus and bridge, courtesy of the urchins of Fresno's Roosevelt Elementary School is the centerpiece of the song. Written for radio play in a just world, the song could have propelled Visitor Jim to the big time had it been released in 1994. ""Henry & Holly"" has enough of a minor key jangle and a wistful whine to satisfy fans of early REM. A gentle, easygoing song with a throwback, Beatlesque chorus and early George Harrison-style ringing strums for flourish, it's one of the highlights of the disc in a quiet, unassuming way. The instrumental closer, ""The Ballad of Belle and Ruckus,"" starts out with some cluttered soft noise before slipping into a sleazy, glam-tinged groove. A simple organ phrase falls into place, adding depth. The song crescendos with the ancient trick of letting everything but the guitar lines suddenly drop out, and then recedes in a short denouement. All very nice, and with nothing so disturbingly odd as to be off-putting. However, flaws do appear from time to time. One of the unwelcome vibes persistent throughout Visitor Jim is the overt hinting at the Caucasian groove of the Spin Doctors. It's really only an undercurrent and can safely be ignored by exerting a little conscious effort to do so. This common ground is exemplified on the song ""Success of a Cynic"" which leaves the listener feeling that the band owes as much of a debt to those king-goofballs of bad rock as they do to the bands that they'd like to regard as their influences and peers. And while none of the songs (even the best ones) are particularly challenging in any way, that doesn't have to be a strike against. I'm not necessarily always up for a challenge. When all is said and done, Visitor Jim might work best as a jadedness litmus. If you can still find a little bit of Forrest Gump-style wonder in familiar rock structures and manipulative pop hooks, then Visitor Jim may get some well-deserved rotations on your stereo; if you're so far gone as to ignore any disc that doesn't see its first release as an Icelandic import, you'll probably be left as cold as a frigid post-rock soundscape.","As if the novelty of having an entire band-- albeit a trio-- named Jim wasn't enough of an ""angle ...

A Ritual Loop,Per Mission,by: Brent S.

There are precious few ideas, innovations and excesses that have not been, at one point or another, warmly welcomed inside. But that famous hospitality has only been grudgingly extended to the spoken word; its presence has frequently earmarked the music for charges of pretentiousness, academicism and self-indulgence. 75-piece symphony orchestras and 40-minute exploratory jazz-rock odysseys have always been given a pass, but for some reason, the spoken word has been dogged at almost every turn. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Spoken word contributions have provided some of modern music's most abysmal moments: the faux-T.S. Eliot boilerplate tacked onto the end of the Moody Blues' ""Nights in White Satin,"" for instance; or pretty much anything by Jim Morrison. More recently, the momentarily hyped Lift to Experience littered their album, The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads with ponderous Biblical citations and confessional chitchat. But the spoken word has surely had its moments. Langston Hughes' sly and dolorous poems set to the muted burlesque of Charles Mingus made Weary Blues one of the more elegant and thoughtful recordings in modern jazz. The delirious, intertwined poetics of the Velvet Underground's ""The Murder Mystery"" made the track one of the artiest, and arguably, most ambitious thing they recorded in the post-Cale period. The nightmarish recordings of Hitler on John Zorn's Kritsallnacht lent that record an unimaginable sense of terror. Brian McMahan's bored, pedestrian narratives on Slint's Spiderland were so defiantly anti-musical that they came off punk as fuck. And what music fan doesn't have the words ""Number 9, Number 9, Number 9"" burned in their consciousness as one of the creepiest sound bites of the 1960s, Manson's cracked race war interpretations aside? Per Mission's aptly titled A Ritual Loop employs the human voice to almost liturgical effect: pressed intimately against other voices, set to sparse, nocturnal accompaniment, intermittently intelligible, and eerily lovely. Calling Per Mission a side project is virtually pointless; sorting out the musical lineages of the Louisville, Kentucky scene is like untangling Hapsburg genealogies: an endless combination and recombination of incest and various degrees of greatness. Jason Noble, ostensibly Per Mission's creative director, played in the short-lived, now legendary Rodan before becoming a primary member of the Shipping News and Rachel's. Per Mission also features pianist Rachel Grimes, violist Christian Frederickson, drummer Edward Grimes (all members of Rachel's); as well as Shipping News drummer Kyle Crabtree. But perhaps appropriately, A Ritual Loop boasts no credits. Mastered by art-electronics-found-sound wizards, Matmos, the album has an air of anonymity that's captivating. Female voices, electronics, and live instruments are all distilled indistinguishably in dark, gothic erotica. The opening track, ""Two Stories,"" blends various narratives where true voices read against distortions, slowed and sped-up vocal tracks, and the occasional flash of pitter-patter drum machines. The female voices are soft and close, as if reading dirty French poems and somewhat ashamed. Unfortunately, the beats on ""Two Stories"" are tried and obvious. But the rich, tribal percussion of ""In Full View"" apologize for an early misstep: bright bells and low drums amidst circling organs and growling effects; its post-rock's evil twin, meticulous and menacing. The spare, piano-dominated ""Headphoneland"" resuscitates the narrative, albeit in fragmented form: stutters of female voice that don't quite add up to good sense. In the background, behind the voice that continuously attempts the word ""music,"" electronic effects seem to slip backwards. The song simply unravels. The dark psychedelic terror of ""Bassdemetr"" should be kept on a continuous loop on October 31st; the cymbals crash with trepidation, while organs and processed effects pile layer upon layer of breathless noise. You can feel it in the pit of your stomach, and on the back of your neck. Likewise, the murky, beautiful ""The Aureate"" spreads processed guitars over the manically methodical drums, punctuated by bells. The ghostly murmur spins out from the corners like spider webs. The tangled male and female narratives of ""Discovered/Incised"" unfolds thoughtfully over exotic acoustic guitars, reminiscent of the late John Fahey. The voices do not need to be understood to be compelling. They are briefly everywhere. A Ritual Loop is wonderful when it manages these moments of penetration: when the voices truly seem omnipresent, when the fuzzy beats assimilate into the environment, when the organs get in your bones. And although it works more often than not; its failure is somewhat contaminating. There's nothing worse than a spooky, sexual masterpiece exposed as obvious and gimmicky. It's like seeing the staples on the skeleton in the haunted house; or suddenly realizing the spiders hang down from strings. The ingenious deployment of the human voice may be the factor that continuously keeps A Ritual Loop from devolving into the minimalist psych-world-dub that Bill Laswell has been rehashing for the last ten years. Yet, like Laswell, A Ritual Loop seems to make the most sense in the bedroom, where you're too preoccupied to pick at its inconsistencies. The voices, instruments, and electronics, when left alone, seem most palpable. But one cannot deny the incredible effect the spoken word has on what might otherwise be lackluster ambience. It's a different brand of ambience: not a room full of abstract sound, but a room momentarily full of life.","Like God's house, the house of modern music has many rooms.

Happiness,Fridge,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2aabf31b7dc71560e1/1:1/w_160/5e1120b7.jpg,2001-10-18 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3198-happiness/,Temporary Residence,"And I thought my quest had reached its end. After years of searching through used record bins, bothering knowledgeable friends for recommendations, and picking up parasites from local thrift shops, I had found Happiness. It wasn't exactly in the form I'd expected. I always assumed that when I finally found Happiness, it would be a glowing, golden piece of vinyl with a radius of exactly pi, with chubby cherubs floating around it, singing their sweet songs of joy. Instead, I found Happiness in the form of a CD, packed in a seemingly normal plastic jewel case, with a pretty flower on the cover. Thinking that I'd finally reached the final goal of all my years of record shopping, I immediately sold all my records and CDs to the local store, using the remaining money to buy honey and ambrosia to eat while listening to my newfound Happiness. I was so excited, I could barely even bring myself to actually listen to the CD. What mysteries lay within the sanctified aluminum grooves of the magical disc? The sounds of ancient spirits rejoicing at being freed from their earthly selves? A single sound containing an amalgamation of every possible waveform in the universe? Quantum theory proposes that everything in the universe is just a synthesis of waves of probability? Perhaps Happiness would even be the sound of these very waves! Finally, standing naked in the middle of my room with a glass of wine in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other, I decided to unravel the mystery of Happiness. To my dismay, I discovered that there isn't all that much mystery to be unraveled. On their fourth album, Fridge, an instrumental band out of Putney, England fronted by Kieran Hebden (who also records pastoral IDM as Four Tet) and featuring bassist Adem Ilhan and drummer Sam Jeffers, have recorded a mellow, organic, and very well constructed instrumental album. Part vibraphone-laden, Chicago-style post-rock, part electronic minimalism, and part pure melodic exploration, Happiness occasionally manages to slip into an immensely blissful groove. ""Melodica and Trombone"" sets the tone for the largely amorphous sound explorations that make up the nine tracks of Happiness. With an organ providing a solid backing for the song, trombones and melodicas weave interlacing melodies. Unsteady hand percussion only serves to make the song's structure more ambiguous, but this ambiguity adds an element of unpredictability to the track-- an element sorely lacking in some other places on the record. Take, for instance, ""Drum Machines and Glockenspiels,"" a 13-minute whopper of a track with a steady drum machine beat and precious few changes in dynamics. Occasionally, some very interesting melodic interplay is achieved between the layers of synthesized beeps, chiming glockenspiels, and subtly plucked guitars that provide the primary melodic focus of the track. As the song progresses, more and more instruments enter the fray-- some more hand percussion, a snare drum, a flute-like instrument, and a more abrasive programmed beat. By the twelve-minute mark, the song has made about two minutes of progress. The melodies themselves just aren't strong enough to support this kind of sustained inaction. Thankfully, Happiness soon redeems itself, drifting away from structured songs and towards some beautiful explorations of sound and melody. ""Cut Up Piano and Xylophone,"" one of the album's most blissfully structureless tracks, is also one of its strongest. Rather than simply piling on endless instruments, the song arranges minced samples of the titular instruments into a shifting, quivering soundscape of descending scales that recalls Tortoise's ""Ten-Day Interval"" or Ghost's ""Daggma."" The relatively short ""Tone Guitar and Drum Noise"" further explores the less structured side of Fridge, consisting almost entirely of a simple guitar figure, treble drones, and rhythmic noise. At the song's end comes one of the most stunningly gorgeous moments on Happiness: the pure, crisp ring of gently colliding bells. Generally speaking, Happiness is at its best when it focuses on sound rather than song. Fridge seem to work much better with implicit structures than with explicit ones, and when the songs on this record become too formal and arranged, they sink quickly into sonic complacency. Thankfully, there are enough moments of beauty on this record to make up for an occasional lack of forward momentum. By all means, Fridge have constructed a lovely record. But there's a lot more to true Happiness than just being pretty.","And I thought my quest had reached its end. After years of searching through used record bins, bothering knowledgeable friends ...

Area: N/A. Capital: none, the members all live in separate cities. Principle language: English. Traditional music: downcast, yet melodic and pretty pop-rock featuring mostly neutral lyrics about love with an occasional dash of optimism, longing, or melancholy. You may have noticed that Spain and Spain don't really have all that much in common. In fact, Spain, aren't even from Spain; they're American. Mind you, this doesn't stop vocalist Josh Haden from singing with a slight English accent, a move that only serves to further confuse the band's geographical situation. There was a time, back in the 70s, when bands with place-names-- Boston, Kansas, Chicago-- actually came from the places they were named after. Made things a whole lot easier for reviewers. But, of course, the 80s and 90s ruined that, as Asia, Japan, and Texas-- all from Britain-- began climbing the charts. Now I don't know what to think at all when a band comes sporting a geographical location in their moniker. But this is not the issue at hand. The issue at hand is the American band Spain's third album, which I must say is rather dull. Spain is lead by the aforementioned Josh Haden, who you may know as the younger brother of Petra and Rachel from That Dog. All three are the offspring of legendary jazz bassist Charlie Haden, an early collaborator of free-jazz visionary Ornette Coleman, and the band leader on nearly thirty albums of his own. Needless to say, none of children followed in his musical footsteps, but his son did at least pick up the bass. Haden is joined in Spain by guitarist/keyboardist Shon Sullivan, drummer Will Hughes, and guitarist Merlo Podlewski, all of whom are impeccable musicians in their own right. The problem is that when the four of them join forces, the music they make is merely competent, and rarely anything more. As a result, I Believe is one of those albums that hardly anyone could bring themselves to hate, but almost no one could truly latch on to. The album opens with ""She Haunts My Dreams,"" a midtempo number with a fairly spacious arrangement that sounds, for all the world, like it could be a lost Coldplay track. To be fair, Spain have been around for a lot longer than Coldplay, and Haden never clumsily reaches for a falsetto he can't quite manage the way Chris Martin does, but the similarity is absolutely uncanny. For the first time in Spain's career, Haden has also opted to give his songs fuller, wetter production, which makes the comparison that much more apt. As the disc spins on, we're confronted by a series of songs that all suffer from the same afflictions, to varying degrees. For one thing, Haden's melodies are limited in range, and as a result, few of them are particularly memorable. As you're listening, each song is pleasant enough-- you can picture Haden sitting in a wood-paneled studio huddled over his bass and a microphone, pouring out his heart-- but nothing really differentiates one from another. ""You Were Meant for Me"" is a slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued melody and restrained playing. ""Do You See the Light?"" is a slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued melody and restrained playing. ""Oh That Feeling"" is a slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued melody and restrained playing. Are you beginning to sense a theme here? At this point, I think it's important to mention that none of these songs are really bad, but sitting through them all in a row is a chore. Fully half of them use the word ""girl"" in the chorus to refer to a lover, and grates by the time you get to the title track. ""I Believe"" is actually one of the fastest songs on the album, bumping the familiar clean-toned guitar lines ahead a few ticks on the metronome for something that approaches jangly pop, but doesn't quite make it. Elsewhere, it takes a few listens for it to sink in that ""Mary"" only has three actual lines of lyrics composed for it, one of which is ""Mary, Mary."" It's yet another slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued melody and restrained playing, so it doesn't exactly stick out of the bunch. For the big wrap-up, I've been thinking about some possible phrases that best describe my feelings toward Spain. I came up with a few like ""pretty, but dull,"" ""nice, but unengaging,"" and ""pleasant, unobtrusive wallpaper,"" but then I noticed The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sitting on my shelf and realized that the late, great Douglas Adams had perhaps already said it best: ""mostly harmless.""","Spain n. 1.A kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula in SW Europe, including the Balearic and Canary Islands, pop. 36 ...

Sing along with Los Straitjackets,Los Straitjackets,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6113d197565213b51a/1:1/w_160/c47bfa22.gif,2001-10-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4864-sing-along-with-los-straitjackets/,Yep RocCavalcade,"I'll assume most of you aren't too familiar with the bustling metropolis of Lubbock, Texas. I wouldn't be if I hadn't spent my college years there. To be honest, I'm not sure there are many people who were meant to spend a lot of time there, beyond those born and bred in the ""hub city."" The locals, generally conservative (politically, and often otherwise), are polite, mostly soft-spoken and hard working. But life in Lubbock is different than the big city carnival I was accustomed to before heading out west. The rodeo is big, the cinema is packed every weekend and on holidays, and the minor league baseball team is always a draw. Lubbockians also like their music, but don't expect a big club scene. There's something of a good Tejano music circuit, and bar bands grow there almost as plentifully as the cotton. Downtown, in the depot district on Buddy Holly Avenue (Avenue H, for anyone who lived there before 1996, when the name was changed), the Cactus Theater is something of an institution. From the outside, it has all the charm you'd expect from a 50-year old converted movie house, with the old-fashioned marquee and box office straight out of Pleasantville. Inside, the theater walls are covered with murals of the West Texas plains, while the red curtain onstage still reeks of smoke from all the years Don Caldwell and the Texas Rhythm Section were blowing fire up there. Actually, they still are. Old Don leads his band through rock and roll rebirth, putting on shows every weekend at the Cactus. Tunes like ""Respect,"" ""Great Balls of Fire,"" ""Tequila,"" ""Black is Black,"" and ""I Want You (I Feel Good)"" get the shit blown out of them on a weekly basis, and the crowd, white-haired as they are quickly becoming, act like it's the end-all of existence. They literally dance in the aisles, yelping and hollering like kids with no sense of either responsibility or the last 25 years. Maybe it's a nostalgia thing, or maybe Don and his merry old band really are onto something: just rocking the house like it used to be done can still turn normal folks into rock animals. Which brings me to the problem that some newer bands like Nashville's Los Straightjackets will encounter with the unconverted: chiefly that there simply isn't any irony or emotional obligation in their music. The rock they (and others, like the Reverend Horton Heat, or even Man or Astro-Man) play isn't the kind that emphasizes its ties to the Velvets or New York Dolls. And while those bands certainly did know a thing or two about rock, their music was entirely their own. At some point along the line, rock stopped being the music people danced and fucked to, and became a kind of therapy or surrogate family for all the young dudes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that those ""golden oldies"" probably served a similar purpose for the first kids to hear them. But times have changed, and when you throw out the same, relatively straightforward statements 40 years after the fact, the new kids may not have the same reactions. Of course, none of this is criticism of the music. Whatever image qualifiers Los Straightjackets don't have in common with their second cousins in the indie world they account for in sheer love for their music. The band has mostly been known for its attempts at bringing back the surf rock instrumental, a noble goal to be sure, but at odds with a core audience who stopped praising Pulp Fiction when their parents started liking it, and Dick Dale showed up on ""Good Morning America."" All of the Los Straitjackets' other records (four, previous to this one) are instrumental, and approximate all that is surf and twang. They've put out mostly original stuff, though they do occasionally pull out a classic cover (like ""Sleepwalk"" or the theme from ""Rawhide"" on the excellent live album Damas y Caballeros). In fact, live is best way to hear this stuff, because I'm not sure you can really translate the infectiousness of a good surf instrumental in an airtight environment-- the exhilaration and fury of the band's playing isn't really evident on any of the studio stuff I've heard. Including this release, to an extent. Sing along with Los Straightjackets is immediately different from any of the band's other albums because it features vocalists on all but two songs. And because most real surf rock is purely instrumental (the Beach Boys weren't surf rock), they play it closer to trashy garage and 60s white soul here. All the tunes are covers, and the band hires a cast of about a dozen to run through them (literally, most tunes in the 2-3 minute range). I should state that, from the get-go, this album aims to party. When I first heard it, it was somewhat underwhelming because I didn't have the opportunity to really play it loud. When I did, the gems started to shine. Big Sandy is arguably the star of the show, especially when he performs Spanish versions of ""Tallahassee Lassie"" (made famous by Freddy Cannon) and ""Mother in Law"" (Ernie K-Doe). Yes, I realize these are songs that you might not normally admit to your mother admitting she likes. I had many of the same thoughts when I was playing the stuff at the Cactus Theater. But like me, if you give this half chance, you may just start to see the light. The Reverend Horton Heat (perhaps the closes musical relative to Los Straightjackets' raucous revival) lays it all out on Roy Orbison's ""Down the Line."" And leave it to the Reverend to remove any and all tenderness of the original, giving the song a pair for which the old Black Prince may have been too much of a gentleman to thrust upon his followers. X's Dave Alvin takes a similar approach to ""California Sun,"" trying a little testosterone to spice up the tune's inherent bubbly beach factor. You really can practically smell the pomade in this stuff. It's not all boys, though. Exene Cervenka (also a member of X, of course) turns in easily the most surprisingly great performance on this disc (""I'll Go Down Swinging""). She sings with some kind of faux-country whine that I would never have thought could sound good, and she's something to behold here. Her voice is thin-- maybe struggling to keep afloat among the completely assured, Nashville-bound wall of guitar and drums-- but she ends up standing out like a cow-punk diva, decked out in what appears to be actual heartbreak, and enhances the song with the persistence that only a woman let down by one too many men could. ""At least I'll go down swinging, what a swinging way to go."" Reads corny, sounds like the gospel. There are down spots here: Alison Moorer & Lonesome Bob don't exactly light it up on ""I Ain't the One,"" which suffers not from a lack of heart, but from some seriously bland production (""drop the needle music,"" for any of you ad hacks out there), and L-Bob's eerie similarity to lounge crooners like Gordon MacRae. It seems a shame to dump on classic songs, and my only real complaint with the album in general is that it sometimes gets a little too straightforward, like the reverence these guys may have for the material might be prohibiting their ability to bash and clang. The way I get around this is by turning it all the way up. Much better. Of course, there are always going to be the non-believers out there who say that old music is old music and if it was any good in the first place, why don't I already have the originals? To this I say, ""I don't know, why don't you?"" I would also urge naysayers to take a road trip to Lubbock. Take the tour, see the rodeo, and then grab a date and get yourself a couple of tickets to the Cactus on Saturday night. Don't get too close to the stage-- just close enough to the aisle that you can see just what this music does to people. And then try to sit still during the show. Los Straightjackets is betting you can't do it, and so am I.","I'll assume most of you aren't too familiar with the bustling metropolis of Lubbock, Texas. I wouldn't ...

Arena Hostile EP,Frankie Sparo,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a502b1335d7bf1698acf/1:1/w_160/0bb84d65.gif,2001-10-17 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7403-arena-hostile-ep/,Constellation,"Frankie Sparo is a singer/songwriter guy based in Montreal. Earlier this year, he toured Europe opening for A Silver Mt. Zion, and the stripped-down Godspeed unit served as backing band during his set. When the caravan swung through Amsterdam, they dropped into radio station VPRO for a live broadcast, and this four song EP is the document. Frankie Sparo must be one of those artists that works better in small doses, because this 18-minute gem is far more enjoyable than his recent full-length, My Red Scare. The disc includes three songs from that album-- one of which is radically reworked, and the other two are sweetened with the Silver Mt. Zion touch-- and then closes with a solid Stones cover. It's a fine little record, and oddly enough, it's more diverse than his twelve-song long-player. Even more importantly, when this brief EP ends, I wish there was just a bit more. ""Diminish Me New York"" is perhaps the best song from the debut, and he wisely opens both Arena Hostile and most of his live sets with it. A Silver Mt. Zion add some subtle industrial sound effects, which are perfect, and the string swells give the tune the majesty it deserves. As I stated before, the lyrics are almost unbearably sad in light of what's happened to New York since it was recorded, but it would be hard not to appreciate Sparo's sense of lyric detail in any circumstance. ""The Night We Stayed In"" gets a little boost from a walking double bass, and the strings here seem slightly maudlin, like incidental music from a fancy Italian wedding. Oddly enough, the warmer, brighter treatment the tune gets here works much better with Sparo's downcast vocals than the dark shadings of the debut, providing a welcome contrast. ""Here Comes the Future"" is also from My Red Scare, but the tune is barely recognizable in this vastly superior version. For the first time on either of his two records, Sparo actually picks up the tempo a bit, and it suits him nicely. Surprisingly, the mood is lightened further by the presence of some slightly cheesy drum-machine handclaps. Organ, violin and viola once again flesh out the sound, making this perhaps my favorite moment of Sparo's thus far. The final Stones cover is a good one, the less-than-obvious ballad ""I Am Waiting."" It's nice to hear Sparo's grizzled voice wrapping itself around a superior melody, and the spare instrumentation (this one is just him and guitar) helps highlight the fact. I enjoyed My Red Scare, but I was sure I'd never seek out another Sparo record. Arena Hostile is a touching, modest artifact that will make me think twice.","Frankie Sparo is a singer/songwriter guy based in Montreal. Earlier this year, he toured Europe opening for A Silver ...

Bayou Paradis,Gez Varley,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a922c0084474cd0c0f96/1:1/w_160/dc42c19b.gif,2001-10-17 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8415-bayou-paradis/,Force Inc,"Before the Abercrombie and Fitch-endorsing LFO, there was LFO. And I'm not talking about Lyte Funky Ones. This LFO's acronym stood for Low Frequency Oscillators, but their parents knew them as Gez Varley and Mark Bell. Warp Records more than knew them; they loved them: Varley and Bell provided the fledging Sheffield-based label with their first hit, ""LFO."" When I first heard the song, it was on the British chart TV show ""Top of the Pops,"" and my tiny television speakers couldn't handle the 5Hz basslines. Fascinated by the machine music that my second favorite machine couldn't deal with, I bought the single. The frequencies contained on the CD were low enough to be inaudible to ear, yet felt by the body. Years later, after I became a socially inept hi-fi enthusiast, LFO's ""Love is the Message"" EP became my battle weapon. I'd approach sales assistants and ask to try out their new Kef speakers, handing them the disc and standing back. Neither the Kef speakers nor the upscale Finnish hi-fi could register the low frequency oscillations. I would tell the assistant that his equipment just wasn't up to snuff and demand that my disc be removed from the gussied-up Best Buy system. I was truly obnoxious. Not even the CIA's psy-ops speakers could register the quake elements of LFO tracks. I was truly hated. After two albums (Frequencies and Advanced), Varley and Bell dissolved their partnership. I'd like to think that was due to their brain chemistries being altered by exposure to sub-audible sounds, rather than the usual ""Behind the Music"" ego-tripping. Whatever the cause, Bell went onto become a superstar producer, accepting checks and air kisses from Depeche Mode, Deltron 3030, Björk, and, rumor has it, Tenacious D. Varley, by contrast, stayed low to the ground, where he's been ever since. Regrettably, most people just haven't noticed. Bayou Paradis, Varley's second album under his (assumed) birthname, is unlikely to get him much attention beyond his usual audience. And listening to the flawless Chain Reaction-esque techno of the album, I get the impression he cares not. Varley's motivation has always been the groove. His fixation reached an early peak under the G-Man guise with the minimalist classic ""Quo Vadis?"" and its accompanying album, 1996's Kushti. The record still sounds coolly alien, like the irresistible funk of the interstellar medium. Varley came back down to Earth with 1997's Gez Varley Presents Tony Montana, displaying more of his allegiance to the fuzzy dub-techno of the Berlin-Detroit Chain Reaction axis. Not straying from that hazy brotherhood, Bayou Paradis belongs to the same clubbier faction of the alliance as his previous albums. In fact, Bayou Paradis superbly matches Maurizio's self-titled Chain Reaction disc. Both albums relish shimmering percussion tracks and blindingly reflective surface washes, whereas others in the alliance fuzz everything out in a glowering haze. Bayou Paradis begins in this radiance with ""Le Soleil,"" which appropriately shimmers and pulses with the immense energy of a solar flare. The title track mocks the primitive percussion sounds of LFO's debut album by placing them in a sumptuous new dustless environment. The doomy ""Violator"" contrasts well with the title track. (Is Varley deliberately referencing the Depeche Mode album of the same name? If so, is Varley chiding Bell for his chasing of major label cash?) The track is a darkwave stomper, easily gloomy enough for the most morbid Covenant fan. The following cut, ""Gardelle,"" returns to the Maurizio camp, but adds far more clippy and current hi-hat and cymbal programming. Underneath, there's the familiar and beloved rim-shot rumble that harks back to acid house, recalling Phuture's ""Acid Trax."" This record succeeds in its modest aims. Varley has created another set of classy club-ready tunes that techno DJs will justifiably drool over. The man doesn't try for anything else. But whatever anyone thinks about Varley's old studio partner, no one could excuse Mark Bell of not thinking beyond the boxes arrayed in front of him. Varley seems to hide behind his equipment, letting the machines suck up attention. Regardless, if Gez ever plans to make the artistic leap that many have always trusted he could, Bayou Paradis shows no sign of it.","Before the Abercrombie and Fitch-endorsing LFO, there was LFO.

Games at High Speeds,Pilot to Gunner,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07113d19756521383ac/1:1/w_160/2d5f1a12.gif,2001-10-17 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6291-games-at-high-speeds/,Gern Blandsten,"Their name reminds me of that shitty mid-90s movie about a doomed bomber plane mission during WWII, but that isn't important. I'm feeling charitable and, well, these guys sort of rock, too. A lot. It's taken me quite a few listens but I'm feeling them. That said, I surely would have been about ten times as into this as I am now had I first come across this in, say, ninth or tenth grade. By that, I simply mean that Pilot to Gunner gets by on that sort of overtly ""rock,"" unabashedly guitar-centric and kinetic sort of energy that adolescents, by dint of hormones or lack of cynical inhibitions, are so susceptible to. There is, however, much more than brutish chugga-chugga rhythms and screamy vocals to enjoy here. For that sophisticate, college-jerk husk you wear over your dopey inner high-schooler, there's intricate guitar interplay, tense chords, and drumming that's tasteful to the utmost. So there. You allowed to like it now. But chances are that, after several listens, you'll probably like it whether you want to or not. For starters, Pilot to Gunner is sing-songy as fuck. Scott Padden's voice hovers somewhere between Archers of Loaf's Eric Bachmann and-- forgive me-- Faith No More's original singer Chuck Mosely (better known in some circles as ""?""). It's a throaty, hoarse, rousing kind of prolet-rock exhalation, not too far from the style of Tim Armstrong of Rancid and Operation Ivy fame. Coupled with the high quality dueling guitar parts, Madden's raspy pipes, and the contagious vocal lines they belt out, constitute the heart of these songs. The opener, ""Every Minute is a Movie,"" isn't the strongest choice for a lead-off track, but is still a reasonably above-par song. It begins with a few measures of handclaps, lifted straight from the intro to the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love Go,"" before a buzzing wall of fairly corny riffery appears suddenly. The track's vocals are the album's weakest, specifically in the verse sections, but still offer a considerable pay-off in the chorus. In any case, Padden immediately makes his presence and style felt, using his voice to great rhythmic and melodic effect. The end of the song features a short two-voice section that works very well, recalling the similar vocal stylings of Archers of Loaf and any number of D.C.-area acts. ""We Got Games at High Speeds,"" the second and title track, raises the bar to the high level the album will remain at for most of its duration. Again, the melody is key, though this track boasts some of the album's neatest play between the guitar and bass, and lays the foundation for the 1-2-3 punch of gripping, anthemic rock that follows. ""Zero Return,"" ""Put It In the Post,"" and ""It's So Good to Be Here in Paris"" comprise ten straight minutes of shockingly good punk that seems to draw heavily from the more melodic strains of the D.C. tradition, but sounds vaguely like a less cartoonish At the Drive-In. Nevertheless, while these songs should sound sonically familiar, it's nearly impossible to discern obvious influences, which is, of course, the hallmark of a good band. There is an unfortunate, though slight, dip in song quality on ""Bring It Libe"" and ""Believer Receiver"" (tracks six and seven, respectively). They sound like knock-offs of the album's better songs, and noticeably less inspired. But then the ship is righted and stays so for the remaining three tracks: ""Band Finale,"" ""The Lurid Loop's Dead"" and ""Run Interference."" Whatever their songwriting technique, Pilot to Gunner seem to have the communication side of things down pat, which reflects their evocative bandname pretty nicely. Rock wheezes on.","Their name reminds me of that shitty mid-90s movie about a doomed bomber plane mission during WWII, but that isn ...

The Grand Pecking Order,Oysterhead,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2eea9e61561daa717c/1:1/w_160/e1a4f2fa.gif,2001-10-17 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6080-the-grand-pecking-order/,ElektraAsylum,"Do you think that if punk had never happened, we would all be wearing King Crimson t-shirts? It's often said that history is merely a documentation of the winners of the past, and that the cultural values we take for granted are but the idiosyncrasies of our more dominant ancestors. In another life-- one where angst and dissatisfaction never broke through the status quo-- the idea of bypassing an entire generation's music of rebellion (and subsequent, inevitable dilution into dozens of genera) doesn't seem so far-fetched. And yet, there's a maligned minority that sees history differently. You know the type: the guy across the street who lives in his mom's basement blasting Gabriel-era Genesis all night; the guy who never realizes most people don't get Roger Dean's album covers because most people don't live in Oz. It would be one thing if this guy was all alone in his quest to defy history, but the more you investigate, the more you realize that there are hundreds, thousands, maybe millions of these guys out there. Given this stubborn counter-culture, it should come as no surprise that there are indeed multiple versions of history. Oysterhead is something of a regional convention for the Other History. Three basement veterans, each of whom have served time as resident oddball in their respective musical families, converge to compare notes and celebrate the obsessively against-the-grain. So, without further ado, I give you the dirty trio: Les Claypool (bassist/leader of Primus), Trey Anastasio (guitarist for Phish), and Stewart Copeland (formerly the drummer for the Police). And although mainstream history might lead you to believe that theirs would be an embarrassingly insular union, it's not really that out of touch. I should add that the rock supergroup is not exactly a new idea. Additionally, its reputation as being more of an interlude for the diehard fan than any kind of lasting partnership doesn't lend much credence to Oysterhead's existence. Claypool has long been a vocal fan of the Police, so the Copeland connection seems a natural bond. Anastasio appears to be the wild card here, and though I don't listen to a lot of Phish, I have to admit that his willingness to explore all manner of tone colors and styles in this environment is commendable. Claypool's sensibilities seem to shine through most brightly on The Grand Pecking Order. It's not just his basslines (which would be almost impossible to seamlessly integrate into any musical scenario, save an orchestra of rubber bands), but also his persistent juxtaposition of strange voices and stranger characters. Of course, this applies as much to the band itself as the songs, and that his stamp seems most evident on the proceedings is predictable in hindsight. Tunes like ""Mr. Oysterhead,"" ""Army's on Ecstasy"" and ""Shadow of a Man"" could almost pass for Primus tunes with their rather single-minded narrative focus, bass-driven grooves and faux-Waits character studies. However, these are the kinds of tunes that benefit most from the trio's collaboration. Copeland plays with simultaneously more subtlety and precision here than anyone who has played with Claypool in the past, and though Anastasio seems to have been underutilized in many places, is nothing if not more tasteful than Claypool. Is that a recommendation? Are you a Primus fan? Let me try again. Elsewhere, the dynamic shifts towards Anastasio, whose songwriting ability is easily the most traditionally melodic of Oysterhead's three members. He seems to have been the driving force behind tunes like ""Radon Balloon"" (an acoustic pop song in the vein of Mummer-era XTC), ""Birthday Boys"" and ""Oz is Ever Floating."" In each of these instances, melody was placed ahead of the purely groovy, and even though the group lacks any kind of real frontman, vocally speaking, Anastasio's melodies tend to linger in my head longer than Claypool's. Again, it's the playing that will probably get the most headlines for this group, and though I would hesitate to read too much into this music, it's possible Anastasio could ultimately end up with the most to lose by ""throwing away"" songs here. And then there was Sir Copeland, and his heavenly snare and high-hat. From a compositional point of view, it's difficult to tell how much he was involved, save an interesting spoken-word/ambient piece called ""Wield the Spade"" near the end of the disc. Copeland may have been invited to this summit more out of hero-worship from his partners than anything else, but musically, I wonder whom the real leader of this project was. It's obvious he hasn't lost much in the fifteen or so years since we last heard him behind the kit (and Sting, talk about being a ""backup"" musician), and I couldn't help but reminisce a little for the days when this kind of passion for playing was transmitting from radios everywhere. I'd heard that Copeland had gotten lost in a sea of soundtracks and ballets, and was prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, he sounds great. Chalk one up for the forty-somethings that he governs the pace for musos 15 years his junior. What disappoints about this album is that the idiosyncrasies of the musicians never actually gel into something other than a sampling of their individual styles. I guess it's a bittersweet truth that the ones who can find a way to fend off contamination from trends and what is or isn't ""cool"" are often as steeped in their own methods as any punk poet or pop hack. If Oysterhead turns out to be more than a one-off distraction, and one day releases music that ends up being more than the sum of its parts, I guess some kind of historical revision would be in order regarding rock star collaboration. As it is, you get a painless lesson in experimental funk-rock, supergroup dynamics, and that you should never underestimate the influence of the guy in the basement across the street. He's not going away.","Do you think that if punk had never happened, we would all be wearing King Crimson t-shirts? It's often ...

Need New Body,Need New Body,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3baeb335119a49ed79d/1:1/w_160/1b96c841.gif,2001-10-16 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5733-need-new-body/,CenotaphCenotaph,"I'm a big fan of regional flavor-- in music, writing, food, just about everything. Which means these are tough times for me. American culture (if you want to call it that) is becoming homogenized to the point where it's getting hard to tell one place from another. Case in point: I recently moved from a small Midwestern college town to a sprawling Southern metropolis. Once upon a time, this would have meant major culture shock, but I hardly blinked, and now I feel like I've been cheated out of something. Imagine traveling half way around the world to find out St. Petersburg is exactly the same as Chicago. I'm not saying it's to this point yet, but wouldn't you feel robbed? That's how I felt. No matter where I go, I'm always only five blocks (or so) from the nearest McDonald's, ten from Starbucks, and so on. There's just this disheartening sameness everywhere I go. But, not to despair: there's always music. And one of the many great things about music is that it can preserve these regional distinctions. Defining musical periods throughout history have always been closely tied to geography-- unique moments that could have only happened at a specific place and time. Late 18th through early 19th century Vienna, early 20th century Paris, mid-50s Memphis, late-60s Detroit, early-80s New Zealand: there's an unmistakable regional distinctiveness that sets these places and times apart. Even today, anyone with a basic familiarity with indie rock can usually tell the difference between a Chicago band and one from, say, Portland. Lately, I've been enjoying the regional distinctiveness of the sounds coming out of Philadelphia: the so-called ""Psychedelphia"" scene. The term is a little restrictive (and more than a little clunky), and many of the bands categorized under the catch-all banner have little to do with one another. Most could even hardly be called ""psychedelic."" But there is (at least from my standpoint as an outside observer) a sense of community underpinning many of these artists, and a common feeling of exploration rooted in common influences. Bardo Pond probably has the highest profile of any of the participants, or maybe the Lilys. But there's also Aspera (formerly Aspera Ad Astra), Asteroid #4, Lenola, Three 4 Tens, and the Photon Band (I highly recommend Lounge Records' Sounds from Psychedelphia compilation for a good overview). The band that first got me interested was Bent Leg Fatima. First off, what a great name, but more importantly, their early Pink Floyd-inspired saucerful-of-drone was a pop-eschewing wake-up call. Yeah, it was a little revivalistic, but not cheaply so. Bent Leg Fatima didn't last very long, but it was ultimately a good thing because three-fourths of them went on to form Need New Body with some other like-minded freaks. Their self-titled debut does a fine job of taking the Bent Leg's best elements and warping them beyond much recognition by adding, well, a little bit of everything. It would probably help to say that Bablicon's Blue Hawaii recorded most of this album, and that Bablicon themselves play on a lot of it, as do Aspera (though their contribution is unclear). But while Bablicon's imprint is visible, they never overshadow the primary members. Need New Body share a similar sprawling, labyrinthine quality with Bablicon, but whereas the main point of departure for Bablicon is early Soft Machine, for Need New Body it's Faust-by-way-of-Zappa, or maybe Beefheart. At times absurd, ominous, or otherworldly, the debut begins with ""Dirty Bitch Medley"" as a wavering Middle Eastern horn intro launches into an ultra-repetitive beat that draws you in by making you wonder exactly when (or if) it's going to change. An interesting way to start off an album, it shows a lot of confidence and respect for the listener to put possibly the most abrasive thing right up front. Next comes a spoken word piece about a klepto monkey that will turn away most of the people not already turned off by the opening track. Maybe a little too goofy. But Need New Body are just starting up, and it seems as though the band purposely tries to set up a really high threshold as a means to weed out those not in for the long haul. After a few listens, all these parts make sense, but if you're not willing to put in the effort, forget it. (Incidentally, this is what's wrong with so much music: it doesn't expect anything from the listener; it just wants you to sit back and be anesthetized, er, I mean entertained.) This album knows it's good, and if you can't see that, it doesn't need you. Need New Body have embarked on an ambitious and mostly successful 22-track mission to combine Krautrock with electronic, bicycle/junk-shop noise, banjo-led folk, vaudeville, Gamelan, traditional Vietnamese, and cheerleader chants in a way that defies much description. (It depends a lot on what you, the listener, bring to the table.) The resulting album is at once placeless and distinct, everywhere and singular. It's reassuring that someone has found a way to explore all routes and find similarities between them without reducing everything to the lowest common denominator.","I'm a big fan of regional flavor-- in music, writing, food, just about everything.

One Day I'll Be on Time,The Album Leaf,by: Christopher F.

But on this particular morning, I gave myself a few extra hours to recover from the previous night's three-hour haul from Washington, D.C. I'd been in D.C. for a concert by Pitchfork heartthrobs Sigur Rós. The Album Leaf (aka Tristeza's Jimmy LaValle) opened the show accompanied by another guitarist and synth player, a bassist, and a drummer. I suppose the band was effective in setting the mood with their unsurprising washes of Fender Rhodes, delayed guitar lines, and well, pretty much delayed everything. And while their performance was fairly forgettable, their simplicity mellowed the crowd in the only way appropriate before we were to be enveloped in the gorgeousness of our glacial Icelanders. So yeah, I woke up around 10:30 (the wallpaper contractor I'd set an appointment with a few days earlier finally roused my sleepy ass out of bed by banging 100,000 times on the front door). Cardboard boxes were strewn across the floor of my room, all of which had arrived while I was out the day before, most bearing the ""Insound"" return address. These were empty, of course, and a stack of unwrapped discs sat patiently on my desk. I glanced at the new music with a bit of indecisiveness, then pulled out the Album Leaf's One Day I'll Be on Time from somewhere near the bottom of the pile. I wasn't excepting anything spectacular from the record, and as it turned out, there were no surprises. ""Gust of..."" gently opens with-- shock!-- a droning organ before proceeding into pretty homogenous figures of arpeggiating organ and synthlines. Homogenous, that is, to the entire record. Every few songs we get a bit of guitar, and if we're lucky, drums or drum-machine. But for the most part, One Day I'll Be on Time is about minimalism: minimal song variation, minimal melodic creativity, minimal staying power. There are, of course, a few instrumental pop numbers for contrast. ""In Between Lines,"" a prime example, wouldn't have sounded out of place on U2's last record. (This is not a compliment.) Interlocking lines of delayed guitar hit it off with lighthearted beat programming and facile synth ornaments. Perhaps the banality of the track could have been maximized had Bono been called in to sing over it. The record isn't an utter waste, though; a couple moments of serenity are sequenced well enough to save it from total abandonment. The best of these comes with ""Story Board."" The track seems to have been recorded with a single compressor microphone in a room with the windows open, letting the sounds of highway traffic seep in. We imagine LaValle hunched over his acoustic guitar in an asinine mockery of Nick Drake's disconsolate poses. Here, the subtle Rhodes overdubs, rather than seeming contrived, complement the circular patterns of guitar quite calmly. But the bulk of One Day I'll Be on Time's remaining duration, despite the genre in which this record could easily be pigeonholed, is far from easy listening. ""Vermillion"" all too dangerously approaches new age cheese; ""Hang Over"" is like an inebriated guitarist stumbling over his own minimalism; and ""Glimmer,"" the album's closer, is... wait, I already used ""new age,"" right? By the time the record ended, I'd forgotten about the wallpaper guy, who had already nearly finished putting up the new pattern downstairs. As I descended, he asked me what it was I'd been listening to. ""The Album Leaf."" He mentioned that he was also a massage therapist (I'm thinking he's like that guy on ""The Pretender"" who can do anything), and that he thought the album would be ""very appropriate"" for his massage sessions. Considering the nature of the album, that possibility didn't seem too remote. Somehow, the conversation got around to ambient music and Brian Eno (What can I say? This guy is The Pretender!). I contended that Brian Eno is a virtuoso of space, which contributes to the dynamism of his ambient works, and that James LaValle simply changes instruments to create what ends up being an artificial dynamic. The contractor agreed, but then reminded me that even Brian Eno has produced a few U2 records.","Any other Wednesday morning would have opened with a shock into consciousness at\n\ precisely 6:30 a.m. I ...

Retrofitting,Metrovavan,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44ec0084474cd0c366d/1:1/w_160/52fa4fbb.jpg,2001-10-16 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5254-retrofitting/,Darla,"A few months back, as a farewell to a girlfriend I thought I'd never see again, I recorded four mixtapes, themed around the seasons of the year. An aloof emotional gesture, to be sure. The tapes traced the story of our relationship-- from the carefree delight of summer, through the bittersweet grandeur of autumn, the desolate alienation of winter and the transcendent majesty of spring. Yeah, I'm a geek. So are you. If 1999's anthemic Source Material compilation embodied the breezy spirit of June and July, and the sorrow-tinged tones of Kreidler's ""Au Pair"" and Air's ""All I Need"" represented October, Retrofitting would have filled the gap in between. The mood of this album is upbeat, but laced with moments of reflective nostalgia and a subtle tinge of regret. It's that same pang of sadness you feel when twilight creeps in on a Sunday sky, or when a cool Labor Day breeze signals the close of summer. Retrofitting is the debut full-length of Looper knob-twiddler Scott Twynholm, whose previous solo output had been limited to a 7"" released last year. Twynholm's work as Metrovavan infuses the twee-hop styles of Looper's The Geometrid with a darker emotional timbre, shifting emphasis from the group's fluffy lyrics to his instrumental and technical talents. Only two songs on this record feature singing, but Twynholm seems to work best without vocals. The instrumentals on Retrofitting showcase his crisp sampling techniques and his knack for stereo noodling, with the hollow vocals rarely being anything more than a distraction. The banal, cloying lyrics simply take themselves too seriously to be effective. And the prominence Metrovavan gives to the vocal arrangements on ""I'm Glad I'm Not a Spaceman"" and ""Behind the Last Star"" comes at some expense to the instrumental nuance that marks the rest of the album. The rest of the material on this disc is surprisingly well-crafted-- the melodies are catchy without being cliché, the songs are danceable without being predictable, and the instrumental arrangements reference a variety of genres without falling into any particular one. The album opens on a brilliant note with ""Space Shadows,"" a lush cocktail of acoustic strumming, undulating basslines and washed-out amp feedback. Glitchy flourishes creep in at the song's margins while sharp snare-fed breaks set the tempo. ""French Lessons,"" a soft down-tempo groove garnished with cymbal splashes and a melange of vocal samples, continues in the chill, wistful vein of the record. All that's missing from this autumnal tune is a brick-hearth fireplace and a mug of hot cider. Elsewhere, Metrovavan plies his hand at a more obtuse sound on ""Keep Breathing"" and ""A Parisian Taxi Ride in November."" More dissonant and atonal than the rest of the album, these songs are nonetheless quite engaging, and number among Retrofitting's standouts. It's not often that an album's hook retains my interest for more than a few listens. The appeal of a quality single typically only lasts long enough to rope the listener into the more complex songs, then becomes transparent and eventually vanishes. The 24-karat sonic splendor of ""Because of the Sun"" breaks this mold; it's at once the most accessible and the most elaborate song on this disc. What starts out as a linear electro jam evolves into a feel-good dancefloor breakout. The buoyant basslines and funky organ riffs are offset by the distant wail of a plaintive guitar, and the refrains come at you from all angles, touching on every imaginable channel of the stereo spectrum. A mere ten songs comprise this album-- two of those are filler, and another two are rendered unlistenable by Twynholm's sappy vocals. This album could stand to be longer, and could stand to simply be more. Six strong tracks make for a laudable effort, but Retrofitting just isn't ambitious enough to stand out as a classic. Hopefully, Metrovavan will proffer up a little more substance on his next record and dispose of the frivolous lyrics. But if he doesn't, I'm sure I'll still be happy with Retrofitting; it certainly surpassed my expectations.","A few months back, as a farewell to a girlfriend I thought I'd never see again,\n\ I recorded ...

The Carnivorous Lunar Activities of...,Lupine Howl,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda7abf31b7dc7155fbf/1:1/w_160/348fe885.gif,2001-10-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4930-the-carnivorous-lunar-activities-of/,Beggars Banquet,"Whether or not you like their music, you have to respect the guys in Lupine Howl. Three years after being ejected from Spiritualized by the band's control freak leader Jason Pierce, they're off on their own, unabashedly plying the same exact modern psychedelia that was their old band's calling card. And why shouldn't they? Despite Pierce's perfectionist tendencies, these guys were big architects of the Spiritualized sound, and should have the right to revert to it whenever they see fit. The Carnivorous Lunar Activities of Lupine Howl is, in name, the first full-length for the new band, though their U.S. debut, the 125 EP, was more or less an album itself, clocking in over the 40-minute mark. Here, they stretch nine songs out over the course of almost a full hour, coating everything with a thick purple haze of noisy guitar and noodly keyboards. Lupine Howl essentially take the bluesiest moments of past Spiritualized records and use them as the starting point for their sound, placing the emphasis on gritty rock rave-ups, and adding another Marshall to the stack for every orchestra member Pierce hired for Let It Come Down. The sound actually ends up landing closer to the dark, swirling shoegazer sessions of Pierce's old band, Spacemen 3, than it does to anything Spiritualized have put their name on lately. The most unfortunate aspect of the sound Lupine Howl have settled upon is that it's extremely prone to excess. Nowhere is this more evident than in the rambling, bastard Krautrock breakdown that drags ""Carnival"" out to an interminable 10:21. The song itself isn't really that bad, possessed of a decent melody, drums and vocals cast adrift in spacy reverb, and some well-layered guitar tracks, but the extremely repetitive, noisy riffs that pile atop one another in the midsection render the full track flaccid and directionless. Bassist/vocalist Sean Cook holds up well as a frontman, making the most of his strong, if melodically limited, voice and wailing away like a man possessed on his harmonica. But he's often jinxed as he and the rest of the band let the songs escape their grasp. Most of these tracks would be a lot better if the players had the willpower to restrict their length to below five minutes, but nearly every song contains some distracting movement or pointless, noisy outro, diminishing its impact. For example, ""125"" comes equipped with a laser guided melody, as Cook stretches out the phrases and really digs into the long notes while Mike Mooney's guitar careens off every audible object in the background. It's all in the endings, though, and the band have sadly decided to take the approach that more is more, piling layer upon layer of feedback on without ever giving thought to shaping it into something memorable the way a true master of the form like Kevin Shields might have. The song lurches to a soupy halt without ever attempting a return to the verse structure that made it work in the first place. It's not all bad, though-- in fact, the album is bookended by two of its best tracks. The single, ""Vaporizer,"" opens things at a fuzzed-out gallop, announcing Lupine Howl's brand of psych with an authoritative shout. ""The Jam That Ate Itself"" closes things on a high note, applying one of the band's more restrained arrangements to a killer percussion groove laid down by regular drummer Damon Reece (augmented here by Johnny Mattock, another ex-member of Spiritualized). The best song of the whole lot, though, is ""This Condition,"" the one track with just the right number of layers and the correct amount of breathing room around the vocals the entire way through. The final line, ""I wonder do you ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"" may or may not be a swipe at the band's former partner, but it's delivered with incredible feeling, as Cook breaths his soul into his harmonica. It's one of the few moments on the album that really grabs you by the throat and demands that you listen, and it's almost enough to make you forget most of padding the band subjects you to earlier on. The balancing act between excellence and excess ultimately yields in favor of the band, as even the most labored songs manage to reveal a bit of soul in their verses. If Lupine Howl could simply step back from their songs for a second and realize that what they need is some space in the mix and a bit of a trim, they could start making music on the order of their old band. Hiring an outside producer might not be a bad place to start. In the end, fans of Spiritualized may enjoy this, and might be interested in checking it out, but few others will be enticed by what they hear. At the very least, Lupine Howl have shown that can hold their own without Jason Pierce, even if the music they make isn't half as transcendent as something like ""Broken Heart,"" or ""Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space."" Given time, though, they could get there.","Whether or not you like their music, you have to respect the guys in Lupine Howl. Three years after being ...

Oceanless,Landing,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc965e6ef95969322e97/1:1/w_160/52c1eeaa.jpeg,2001-10-15 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4671-oceanless/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Fuzzed-out drone-pop gets a bad rap from some quarters because it doesn't seem difficult to play. People suspect that post-My Bloody Valentine shoegaze is more about shopping than musicianship, in that the skill lies in knowing which pedals to buy. Hell, guitar feedback in its most elemental form doesn't even require the player to, well, move, if you get right down to it. It's not a coincidence that the metaphors typically deployed for this kind of music are passive-- things like drifting, gliding and floating. But Sonic Youth's enigmatic Silver Sessions taught us that overdriven guitars tend to make an unholy racket when left to their own devices. Turning feedback into something the man on the street can call beautiful requires careful manipulation of the never-ending electromagnetic stream. Notice that the seemingly passive verbs used above to describe shoegaze imply a subtle interaction with natural elements like water and wind. Movement here is a matter of channeling the base-level forces in a desired direction. I've always suspected that this had something to do with why Flying Saucer Attack was labeled as ""rural psychedelia""; David Pearce has spent his musical life dirtying his hands in distortion's black earth. Connecticut's Landing inhabits that amorphous space where time itself expands and contracts according to a delay pedal setting, and dream pop blurs into dream proper. Groups like Stars of the Lid and E.A.R. have wandered this same misty plane in search of the perfect drone, but Landing incorporates Bardo Pond's jam aesthetic into the journey, imparting a welcome communal feel to their lengthy, meandering compositions. Landing's effects-heavy guitar sound will not seem new unless you've been trapped under something heavy since 1992, but on Oceanless, they give convincing demonstration of why it has endured. The title of their second full-length has to be a joke, considering many guitar lines seem like heavily processed, six-string interpretations of whale songs. Like Windy and Carl's Depths (Landing have done a split record with the pride of Dearborn), these pieces unfold many fathoms down, in the slow motion required by immense pressure, allowing each ripple of sound to be examined in detail. Its six songs total more than an hour, and two of them stretch past the 20-minute mark. Possibly because the pieces never strive to be proper ""songs"" (a couple of whispers aside, it's an instrumental album), they never seem overly long, and most develop nicely from faint drones to epic crescendos and back again. This flair for drama is best exhibited on ""Are You Gone to Vast Arc Hues?,"" a live piece recorded in a Provo, Utah coffeeshop (near where the band was formerly based). The opening drone whines like a siren, and then a melodic bass inspired by Galaxie 500 folds in, followed by an elongated implosion of guitar feedback. As the piece builds, the loose drumming becomes a key element, lending a slightly unpredictable pulse (another Galaxie 500 pointer?) that fits with the barely controlled howl. Around the ten-minute mark, the piece hits a long patch of pure shoegaze bliss, as overtones cluster and multiply like bacteria in a petri dish, and a dense fog of pure pink noise threatens. The song fades out slowly over several minutes, as the voices of the café eventually reclaim the space. Elsewhere, Oceanless hearken back to the more restrained, earthy sounds of earlier Landing records like the Centrefuge EP. ""Structure vs. Chaos"" is an exercise in reverb and delay, as twin guitars serve mainly to set a variety of echoes in motion, and the resultant melodies seem both accidental and quite beautiful. ""How Did You Feel?"" represents the dark end of Landing's expression, with a sinister bassline reminiscent of Joy Division's ""Transmission"" (because of the tempo, it reminds me a lot of Low's cover), harsh guitar drones, and buried vocals that never approach comprehension. This black moment is the exception. Through most of Oceanless, I feel the ascension of the best drone music, the blissful high that comes from slowly converting force into movement.","Fuzzed-out drone-pop gets a bad rap from some quarters because it doesn't seem\n\ difficult to play.

The charity-jocking No Mayo label has sold out to Matador, inexplicably replacing all the big names of the first compilation with some mostly unheard-of cats they're hoping will blow up and make this move more units than Nelly (all for the schools!). Here's your track-by-track: Skhool Yard: ""Here We Come"" - Better than it had to be, although these guys really shouldn't have let Protest out from behind the boards. Why do all new MCs sound like Planet Asia? Is it because he's just so nice? Rasco: ""Uncut"" - It's not another ""Unassisted"" (what is?) but it's still nice in that Rasco bump-bump way. ""Front page like I was George W. Bush."" Fuck yeah. Live Human: ""Lagoona's Bliss (Elephant Mix)"" - Yeah, I had this track on their album and it was okay, but I'm feeling this remix a lot more. DJ Logic, hold ya dome. Azeem: ""Contradictions"" - Motherfuck Green Day, why do all the poetically inclined MCs always listen to worst white-people music? That said, the production on this isn't bad and the lyrics are passable. I like that tropic of cancer bit. Zion I: ""We Got It"" - North Cali mix-show fodder, if he's lucky. Foreign Legion: ""Bike Thief"" - Maybe I'm crazy, but this is dope. The pre-teen ""steal shit"" lyrics are cuter than Kris Kross and the beat makes me jump up and down. I like it. Eye Cue and Rashinel: ""Clear the Slate"" - Mediocre until the beat changes up halfway through and then it's boom-bap brassy goodness like a nasty Pete Rock track. ""Incredulous is incredible, and I'm awestruck/ Can't you tell because of the presence of dumb-fuck?"" Um, yes? Anticon: ""Pity Party People"" - Formula for massively pleasurable yet ultimately forgettable Anticon posse cut: put some De La on the intro, grab a shimmery loop out of big Anticon bag of circular guitar samples, have no mic skills, be white as fuck. And it's beautiful! DJ Vinroc: ""3thahardway"" - Very possibly the least interesting scratch track to come out the bay area since ""Drop the Weight,"" and that's saying something. Stymie and the Pimp Jones Love Orchestra: ""Fan Club"" - Shit club. Encore: ""The Movement (Precedent Mix)"" - Architect is an underrated producer but he's still just biting Primo circa Hard to Earn. It's hard to make jazz licks propel Encore's flow instead of riding under it, but somehow it works. Kemetic Suns: ""We a Warrior"" - Promising opening lines about bucking down demons and vampires, but what a drab chorus. Silly suckas. EB F: ""Condiments"" - If you can listen to this twice, you're on more West Coast dick than Mack 10. Sahnuhtayshun Duhpartment Muzik f/Khaos Unique: ""I'm K.U."" - That's a bitch of a name but this really isn't bad, and Del guest-mumbles on it too (uncredited, of course). I bet this would sound nice on an O-Dub tape. Pep Love: ""Warrior Poet"" - Least interesting Hiero member goes out and rips it! Tinkly keys and loping cello sound like the beats Mathematics gave GZA for that last album. Not bad, not bad at all. So there you go. It won't get much love up in the clubs but there's a few cuts worth your half-hearted spin. If you can't cop the Rasco and Foreign Legion joints off Audiogalaxy then you might want to pick up the $5 promo now sitting at an indie used bin near you and dance around in your underwear til volume three drops, hopefully with no fake-ass funk and more of those hot singles that we know the left coast underground can do so well. It won't ""plant the seeds for educating the next generation musically"" (like Erick Arnold says in the self-important liner notes, bigging-up the rap game like the poor man's Chuck D). But we can leave that responsibility safe with ODB, can't we?","Despite having too many fucking instrumentals and being on some corny ""save the music"" tip, the first Funky Precedent record ...

The Olatunji Concert: The Last Live Recording,John Coltrane,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6285e6ef95969320c80/1:1/w_160/cc32bcb6.gif,2001-10-15 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1550-the-olatunji-concert-the-last-live-recording/,Impulse!,"""He not busy being born is busy dying.""
- Bob Dylan, ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding"" ""Live flesh and coursing blood, hearts, brains, souls spluttering fire!""
-LeRoi Jones, ""Black Art"" April 23rd, 1967. John Coltrane appears for his penultimate public performance before a crowd at Babatunde Olatunji's Center for African Culture in New York City. Three months later, liver cancer would claim his life. He would play once more in front of a live crowd, but the last available live recording is documented here. On this set, he's bolstered by drummer Rashied Ali, bassist Jimmy Garrison, pianist Alice Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders on tenor sax and Algie Dewitt on bata drum (a Yoruba instrument). For legions of jazz aficionados around the globe, this final live document is something of a Holy Grail. And now, thanks to sound engineer Bernard Drayton (who still had possession of the master tapes), anyone with $15 can finally get their mitts on one of the most historic documents in all of 20th century American music. Coltrane spent the last years of his life engaged in a mission that few could understand. As witnessed on A Love Supreme and other recordings during those later years, his ultimate objective was that of a continued spiritual awakening. Whereas the objective itself was not that difficult to grasp, Coltrane's means of attaining it were far from conventional. Abandoning the preconceived notions of tonality, and immersed within a musical state of dissonance, Coltrane's music became a communicative attempt at reaching a higher plane. Spawned during one of the most tumultuous eras in history, Coltrane's ideas were reflective of a period in which the foundations of American life trembled to the core. Influenced by the nation's entrenchment in war, its social and political upheavals, and its civil rights and protest movements, John's music deserted almost any semblance of traditional form in a move toward celestial harmony and universality. In the early months of 1967, faced not just with the chaos of society, Coltrane waged his own personal war with death and his music again shifted. What's documented here is that personal warfare, replete with bursting explosions and a splattering of machine-gun notes. No sooner than Billy Taylor can introduce John as ""one of the most remarkable forces in jazz today,"" Coltrane comes up front and center on ""Ogunde,"" opening the set with a warm, bluesy moan. But this is only temporary. Almost immediately, the rest of the band in tow, Coltrane embarks on a trans-dimensional flight, bleating and coaxing sounds from his sax, and escalating at a fever pace to the highest register with guttural whoops and hollers. ""Ogunde,"" based on the Afro-Brazilian song ""Ogunde Varere,"" is an almost thirty-minute wall of dissonance, peppered with shrieks and howls. It's as if Coltrane is expending every imaginable source of personal energy here to create a swirling maelstrom of noise. Coltrane and Sanders swap solos: John rips out with a weeping wail before ascending into a full-blown shriek attack; Pharoah begins playfully, reeling off a fiery solo, dancing around a theme, and then descending into a grunt-filled rage. Ali focuses on polyrhythms and spacial dancing, consistently adding dimensions and crossing barriers, taking the band into something otherworldly, while Garrison's bass remains muscular, anchoring the sound and expanding the framework. Alice Coltrane's percussive plonks and thuds drift in and out of the background before she rolls out her own deft solo, scrambling around the melody and filling the space rapidly with sixteenth notes while the saxophonists quietly wait for their scorching return. Soon, Coltrane roars back in, the band following on his comet's tail. Coltrane and Sanders successively spit out anguished yelps while the band soars into wraithlike dimensions, teetering on the precipice of a volcanic eruption. From here, the track remains full-throttle until it ends with Coltrane and Sanders invoking the spiritual via an ecstatic rite of fire. After Coltrane humbly gives his thanks to the elated audience, Jimmy Garrison steps into the spotlight for a lengthy bass solo that introduces Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""My Favorite Things."" A staple of Coltrane's set since the early 60s, ""My Favorite Things"" had now morphed from The Sound of Music's simple innocence into something altogether beastly and monstrous. Garrison flexes his chops for well over seven minutes with brawn and grit, piecing together a skeletal structure and beating the path for the others' departure into unknown terrain. What follows is music overflowing with such emotional and spiritual intensity that it floods your living room. Coltrane's bleats and squeals are drenched with a searing pain. It's like the sound of rending flesh, the tune ripped apart and broken into sorrowful hollers and moans. With the band thundering behind them, the two sax players are intent on dousing every inch of that NYC block with their incendiary fury. Explosions, barking yawps, shrill high-register runs, and throaty, rasping groans-- the place sounds like it's going to spontaneously combust. Occasionally, there's slight recognition of the Rodgers & Hammerstein theme as Coltrane references the motif before descending into death howls and mournful prayer. If ""Ogunde"" was a full-throttled blare, ""My Favorite Things"" clambers rapidly out of this realm and into permanent celestial gravitation. Coltrane maintains velocity at this pace for nearly twenty minutes, caught in a firestorm from which no one will walk away unscathed. For every intent and purpose, this is difficult music. It's the demanding sound of a man faced with impending death, yet unafraid to carry forward and remain steadfast to his intense, singular vision of music as a universal bridge. With every note, Coltrane chases a higher power in an attempt to transcend the corporeal. For the unprepared listener, it might all be too much-- not only because of the sheer intensity of noise levels or dissonance, but because this is the sound of a man who knows every breath he draws inches him one step closer to the grave. Yet, the sadness this evokes is overwhelmed by the pure beauty of a man being rebirthed, recreated, and reimagined. The Last Live Recording is a deliriously scattered mess of joy and pain, intermingled and bound up within Coltrane's unbridled and luminescent energy. And now it stands as his parting gesture: one last moment bursting out at the seams with elation and ferocity, an awe-inspiring testament to life.","""He not busy being born is busy dying.""

Triple Point,Loscil,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd63abf31b7dc7155f2f/1:1/w_160/532db1d4.gif,2001-10-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4866-triple-point/,Kranky,"We learned the first and second laws of thermodynamics in my 7th period physics class junior year. The first law of thermodynamics states that, in a closed system, the total energy, including heat, is conserved. The second law states that heat flows spontaneously from a hot body to a cool one, that one cannot convert heat completely into useful work, and that every isolated system becomes disorder with time. I stopped doodling long enough to copy these laws into a free corner of my notebook. 8th and 9th period ruminations didn't make the second law any more comfortable, so I went home and cried. Really. Loscil is both the basic unit that Csound software uses to build a sampling synthesizer, and the pseudonym that Canadian sound designer Scott Morgan performs and records under when he's not drumming for Dan Bejar's Destroyer. I can only assume that Morgan, who has been active in the Vancouver music and new-media scene for some time, has put more than a few loscils to use; possibly even some loscil3's, which use fancy cubic interpolation schemes. Triple Point, Loscil's debut record was titled for the point when the vapor, liquid, and solid phases of a material are all in equilibrium. And as it so happens, it's an ambient dub concept album about thermodynamics, created with samplers, synths, and a Powerbook. Sure, the idea has some potential, since the dark promise of thermodynamics' second law can bolster nihilism and elicit a very strong emotional response from humans, but the odds aren't on the side of success. After all, most people don't know much-- if anything-- about thermodynamics, and this combination can quickly equal bad art. Bard College might give 2\xBD credits for interpretive dances inspired by ""Fuel Exergy,"" but that doesn't mean you want to listen to its audio counterpart on the way to work in the morning. Triple Point begins where the periodic table does: the opening track is titled ""Hydrogen."" The song starts with a muted beat under a looped two-note synth melody, and then neatly adds elements to this base one at a time. It sounds more like Bergheim 34 at half-speed or Aphex Twin than any primary component of the universe to me, but somehow, the music seems like it might be anticipating something. It anticipates more of the same. The second track, ""Ampere,"" begins with the exact same formula as ""Hydrogen."" The drum machine starts with what sounds like a heart beating to a mutant rhythm, while the synthtone keeps the pacing of a respirator. While I wait for more sounds I hit the dictionary. ""An 'Ampere' is equal to a constant current which when maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible circular sections..."" I notice a three-note melody of synth cello and a dance beat have been introduced. The last element to enter the song is clanking, irregular percussion. For the first time so far on Triple Point, the metallic beat sounds like something that might have been played by a human instead of processed by a sequencer. And though the sound is flatter and more contained than live drums, the excessively sterile quality of the rest of the record seems heightened when it drops out. The next song, ""Pressure,"" is actually an IDM cover of that ridiculous Billy Joel number. Oh! That was just my imagination! It's actually just spacy music that might lead one's mind to wander. ""Pressure"" is sparse, and filled with ""pssst"" noises that leak out with every long slow synth tone. At this point in the record, it becomes clear that Triple Point is less a musical interpretation of thermodynamics-- or a response to the implications of thermodynamics that some might find sad or frightening-- and more a recording of what these processes might sound like if they were closely miked. Morgan's digital dubs add detail to loops as they build throughout the songs, thus creating the impression of ""listening in closer"" to hear small bubbles popping and delicate echoes pulsating. ""Vapour"" is Triple Point's haunted house. A sharp intake of air trails each programmed gong tone. The low ring shifts pitch as swarms of sound swing in and out. A ping-pong ball bounces once and then dribbles off. If the song was longer, the looped ping-pong ball would quickly become the aural equivalent of Chinese water torture. It brings to mind the work of electro-acoustic tape artist Francis Dhomont, who used samples like balls, chains, and gears almost cinematically to create spaces. While Loscil's work is based in rhythm and meditation unlike Dhomont's free compositions, the dampened beat and sterile synths he repeatedly uses on Triple Point could use some of Dhomont's creaks, cranks and flutters. The concepts of thermodynamics are difficult to express in writing, music or art. Entropy and heat death are famous for being misused in tacky metaphors to explain chaotic social dynamics, atonal music, and relationships in need of therapy. Thomas Pynchon gave it a shot in his early story, ""Entropy,"" but now is very critical of the piece. He's since written that the concept was so forced that the characters themselves were shortchanged. His advice to others is, ""Get too conceptual, too cute and remote, and your characters die on the page."" Triple Point might be inspired by thermodynamics, but Loscil's attempts to communicate these ideas through sound are forced. Sure, the placement and timing of the samples is finessed-- Morgan has a clear talent for arranging sound-- but after ten tracks, the muted beats and droning synths just sound dead. But then again, the ""triple point"" of a material marks a moment of stasis. So that might all be part of his plan.","We learned the first and second laws of thermodynamics in my 7th period physics\n\ class junior year. The first ...

Chemistry Is What We Are,Simian,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4105e6ef959693207ac/1:1/w_160/61e5b136.gif,2001-10-14 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7172-chemistry-is-what-we-are/,Astralwerks,"After avoiding biology my entire life, I'm getting my first exposure to the science of evolution this year. I find most interesting the metaphors that are drawn to give the students the best possible conception of evolution. One example was used to illustrate the possibility that humans were created through a series of accidents. Naysayers suggest that humans have as much chance of sprouting from evolution as a monkey has of rewriting Shakespeare's sonnets if armed with a barrel of letters that could be arranged in such an order. My professor made the point that evolution works such that once one of the monkey's letters falls into the correct position, it sticks and eventually, the monkey has all of the sonnets. While the example sounds ridiculous, Simian's debut full-length works in much the same way. Please pardon the pun. Chemistry Is What We Are takes very disparate elements and flings them together. Sometimes it sticks; sometimes it doesn't. ""Drop and Roll,"" the lead-in track, begins with a childlike vocal and an accordion playing a steady I-IV line (think circus march) before crashing in with ride-heavy drums and a set of voices singing in harmony. Organs reiterate the sinewy melody, and is accompanied by some lulling ""na-na-na's."" Things break down with some simple drum machine noises and lyrics about fire. And while this doesn't sound much like the Beta Band, there's an atmosphere that parallels the space-age pastiche of Simian's labelmates. ""The Wisp"" lashes out with Aphex Twin-style synth pulses and a multitracked chorus spilling out four-part Beach Boys harmonies. The song is sparse, but layered with effects like raygun fire and clanking glass. Unfortunately, on this track, it tends to be more distracting than enhancing. That's not to say that things aren't interesting in the world of Simian. Their fantastic lyrics demand dissection and the percussion heavy atmosphere anchors the sporadic noises. Take the lyrics of ""One Dimension"": ""I see the world in one dimension/ I only see through my dementia.../ Feelings seem to run my mind/ Clarity is bliss, but/ Chemistry is what we are."" It's far from Blink 182's philosophies about love in ""All the Small Things."" To further ground the disparity, the ghost of John Lennon plays a vital role in the songwriting of these four Manchester lads. A majority of the tracks, if stripped of their studio playtime, would be revealed as very structurally simple songs, with infectious yet sometimes unconventional melodies. ""Mr. Crow,"" one of the standouts here, seems to draw the most inspiration from Lennon, resembling some of his solo tracks with a standard, driving drum pattern, strummed acoustic guitar, and harpsichord synths along with those layered harmony vocals the band seems to hold so dear. Simian records in a studio named Trial and Error-- the phrase isn't far off the mark in describing the musical extras of Chemistry. The performances are always energetic, but lack a sense of focus that could come with a premeditated plan for recording their music. The end product of this process delivers 50 minutes of constant movement. Still, there are points at which calm would be a good thing.","After avoiding biology my entire life, I'm getting my first exposure to the science of evolution this year. I ...

Is This It,The Strokes,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58b13d1975652138f9b/1:1/w_160/c1b895b7.jpg,2001-10-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7537-is-this-it/,RCA,"Hype. It's a bitch. Ascending mediocre bands to heights of unwarranted popularity, and smacking the truly great down to ""critics' pet"" status, hype has become a plague on any band hoping to achieve unbridled adoration among music elitists. When the media hounds smell success and respond with their annual cry of ""saviors of rock and roll,"" disappointment is inevitable. So it goes with the Strokes, a band that's seen enough publicity in 2001 to make bin Laden jealous. Touted by the press as ""the forefathers of a bold new era in rock,"" ""the greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones"" and ""the second coming of the Velvet Underground,"" the Strokes have nowhere to go but out of style. And the album only came out last week! So why all the fanfare? Are they really that good? Of fucking course not. There is no bold new era in rock; the Rolling Stones have yet to be contended with; and if there ever is a second coming of the Velvet Underground, they won't be doing second-rate imitations of Lou Reed. The Strokes are not deities. Nor are they ""brilliant,"" ""awe-inspiring,"" or ""genius."" They're a rock band, plain and simple. And if you go into this record expecting nothing more than that, you'll probably be pretty pleased. See, while I can't agree with the Strokes' messianic treatment, I'd be lying if I said I thought Is This It was anything other than a great rock record. What's refreshing to me about the Strokes is that, in a musical climate where even the dirtiest garage bands can create the illusion of million-dollar studio techniques through sound filters on mom's Packard-Bell, the Strokes prefer to rock in the classic vein: no laser sounds, no ethereal reverb, no pre-programmed Aphex beats. Their influences are so firmly rooted in the post-punk tradition that it's as if the last two decades had never occurred. The same names are always dropped: the Velvet Underground, Television, the Stooges. And while the Velvets are obviously a major source of inspiration, the Strokes' only similarity to Television and the Stooges is the confidence with which they play. Frontman Julian Casablancas' vocals bear more than a passing resemblance to early Lou Reed, but where Reed seemed to accidentally dispense life-changing lyrics through a drugged drawl, Julian sings about the simple trivialities of big-city life with stark lucidity. These songs revolve around frustrated relationships, never coming near to approaching anything that might resemble insight. Yet, with Casablancas' self-assured, conversational delivery, and the almost primal energy of the four guys backing him, attention shifts from the simply present lyrics to the raging wall of melody these guys bang out like it's their lifeblood. There's a hint of Britain's post-punk 70s in the Strokes' frenetic furor. Bands like the Buzzcocks and Wire subscribed to a similar less-is-more production aesthetic, and seemed naturally adept at scribbling out instantly approachable melodies. And like Singles Going Steady (and, to a lesser extent, Pink Flag), there's something in the Strokes' melodies that few other bands possess: they're immediate without pandering, relying on the instant gratification of solid, driving rhythms while maintaining strong but simple hooks that seem somehow familiar, yet wholly original. Their production is stripped raw, and not terribly divergent from that of their band-of-the-moment contemporaries, the White Stripes. But the difference between the two bands lies in their degrees of skill: the Stripes have an air of amateurishness that belies songwriter Jack White's obvious talents; the Strokes, even on their debut album, sound like experienced professionals for whom mastering the form seems only an album away. ""The Modern Age"" stomps like a renegade elephant with bashed kickdrums and turbulent guitar riffs while Casablancas passionately reels off, ""Work hard and say it's easy/ Do it just to please me/ Tomorrow will be different/ So this is why I'm leaving,"" in an unsteady sing-speak that invokes all the right elements of a great rock leadman. ""Last Nite"" quakes with growled vocals and bluesy, blustery distortion. ""Hard to Explain"" eerily recalls the blissful pop of the Wrens' Secaucus with an unforgettable hook, distorted drumkits and fuzzed-out ride cymbals. Of course, none of this changes the fact that Is This It lacks the creativity and unconventionality inherent in any of the all-time great rock bands they're so impulsively compared to. Still, the Strokes have struck an incredible balance between the two extremes of rock music: sentimentality and listlessness. Any sentimentality in these songs' lyrics is countered by Casablancas' self-reliant indifference, and his listless delivery is offset by the band's fervid attack. Beyond that, it's hard to pinpoint what exactly it is about the Strokes that keeps me listening. All I know is that it's not easy to come by, and I like it. A lot.","Hype. It's a bitch.

My Red Scare,Frankie Sparo,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a501c0084474cd0c0608/1:1/w_160/71b5e625.gif,2001-10-14 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7402-my-red-scare/,Constellation,"Montreal is the Chicago of the Great White North. I'm not talking about the buildings or the baseball teams or the median waistline, but the tone of their respective independent music scenes. The parallels are striking. A handful of influential labels in each town have supported artists making an effort to expand the boundaries of rock. Both have embraced recent developments in electronic music. Both have vibrant improv scenes with members teaming up in innumerable combinations to experiment. Montreal draws a bit more from film music, and Chicago makes good use of its German imports, but there are common threads, no question. The Montreal/Chicago comparison occurred to me while listening to this album by Frankie Sparo; he's like the Canadian Califone. His songs are painfully slow, and sung in a gruff, downcast voice. They also draw upon the music traditions of the distant past (some folk and blues, even more vaudeville) and the technology of the future (there all sort of wonderfully processed sounds on My Red Scare) to offer a portrait of urban desolation and despair. The production was the first thing that really got to me. Recorded at the now-legendary Hotel2Tango by some folks from Godspeed, Sparo surrounds his songs with some beautiful noise. To extend my earlier comparisons a bit further, the music sounds much more like a Brian Deck production than anything you might imagine from the Godspeed camp. The drums used to hold 55 gallons of oil, cymbals are bowed or left out altogether, and evocative noises of every stripe waft about in the cobwebbed rafters. The guitar ranges from the latter-day Crazy Horse snarl of ""Send for Me"" to the spare, lonesome 50s-style vibrato of the opening ""Bastard Heart."" But there's one essential ingredient lacking from My Red Scare, and its absence is glaring: melody. Sparo goes so far in conjuring an effective mood that he forgets to craft tunes. As I said before, his song structure owes less to folk and blues and more to the bleak vaudeville so loved by Tom Waits in the 80s. But the songs are so incredibly slow and the melodies so vague that Sparo's voice, which is interesting enough at first listen, loses its power. A word combination like ""feeling glamorous"" is sung as ""fee-ling glam-or-ous,"" and takes about five seconds to complete. Annoying, I'm sorry. I can handle it with a band like Low because the melodies reveal their beauty with each new syllable, but songcraft doesn't seem to be a major priority for Sparo. There are some exceptional moments, though. The aforementioned line comes from a track called ""Diminish Me New York"" that I imagine Sparo is getting some good mileage out of these days. Lines like, ""It's so hard to feel tall/ Everything is tall/ Magnificent New York"" are hard to hear now, but somehow, wrapped as they are in the spacious junkyard production, they're moving. ""The Loneliest Mademoiselle"" combines Sparo's reverberating guitar with some affecting layered violin work by Jessica Moss, and it achieves its poignant aim. But these moments where Sparo transcends the limitations of his songs don't come quite often enough, and My Red Scare remains an interesting artifact that never fascinates.","Montreal is the Chicago of the Great White North.

The National,The National,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a85e6ef9596932389d/1:1/w_160/c3553bac.gif,2001-10-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5717-the-national/,Brassland,"There's no substitute for the real thing, but sometimes you take what you can get. It's been too long since the last Silver Jews album. The wait is almost over, with a new one is due next month, but in the meantime, the debut from the National provides a decent appetizer. I hate to be so condescending, and reduce a band to simply being a primer for another band, but they had it coming. From first listen, it's pretty clear the National are going for the same elegantly wasted view of everyday American life captured so well by the Jews, from the solid, but unobtrusive musical backing that shifts focus onto the lyrical content, to the laid-back, just-more-then-slightly-inebriated delivery of singer Matt Berninger. The only problem is, Berninger lacks Jews frontman D.C. Berman's ability to recreate life's mundane ephemera with striking and haltingly vivid imagery, as well as his gift for the kind of lyrical accent and emphasis that can make even bland statements seem revelatory. But I guess it's a little unfair to blame them for not being someone else. Taken on their own terms, the National present solid, perfectly inoffensive adult rock. Like the stuff that sits between the radio hits on a Tom Petty album, it doesn't reach out and grab your attention, but it doesn't really send you running, either. It's just kinda there. After listening to The National three times, I couldn't readily recall any interesting lyrical phrases or melodies, but a vague feeling of satisfaction hung on my mind like residue. So I went back for fourths determined to find out why. What I found is that, if you want much out of this listening experience, you have to be determined enough to take a pick-axe to the frozen, nearly featureless surface that besets the album. So the question becomes: is the payoff worth the effort? ""Beautiful Head"" starts the album off on a strong note, beginning with a sped-up Nick Drake-style acoustic guitar riff that picks up a driving beat before Berninger launches into a tale about seeing an ex-girl friend (or maybe a soon-to-be ex-girlfriend) at a party: ""You walk in taller than you should/ The air is thin around your beautiful head.../ Haven't looked at me forever/ You got a diagram of associations."" The music of ""Cold Girl Fever"" is lifted directly from Springsteen's ""Your Hometown""-- that is, until the end when menacing synth is added to the mix and an almost inaudible backwards vocal track. It took time to add this effect, so it makes you wonder why they don't make it more noticeable, which in a way sums up the whole album: what would normally be tasteful subtleties are awash in a bath of tired, homogeneous arrangements. Nothing gets stressed, just reduced to a forgettable sameness. ""Son"" is a good example of this cover-up job. Hands down the best song on the album lyrically, and underpinned by a echo-y distant drum beat, lines like, ""She's reading books from empty women/ They're giving beauty tips from empty hips,"" and the very Berman-like, ""How is the water of the rain/ And how is the air of the wind,"" somehow become forgettable under a blanket of uninspiring, middle-of-the-road music. They crank it up one notch for ""Pay for Me,"" which out-Son Volts Son Volt, sounding a bit like Tindersticks reinvented as an American roots-rock band. And for about three songs, they build some momentum with ""Bitters and Absolut,"" ""John's Star,"" and ""Watching You Well,"" which play up Berninger's more soulful side, while staying firmly planted in Americana. From a production standpoint, ""29 Years"" is the standout track, using a scratchy LP in-groove as a rhythm track while Berninger croons atop, ""You know I dreamed about you 29 years before I saw you."" Then he becomes disgusted with himself, drops the mic (audibly), and ends the song abruptly. It's the only time the National seem to let their guard down and reveal their personality. The track, while clearly the high point of the album, is unfortunately followed by the droll album closer, ""Anna Freud,"" possibly the most forgettable track here. Ultimately, the National execute like session musicians: very pro but with a similar kind of facelessness. Frontman Berninger hasn't found a distinct voice yet, in his singing or his lyrics, but I get the feeling he very well could someday soon. Until then, they just remind me of how much I want to hear the new Silver Jews album.","There's no substitute for the real thing, but sometimes you take what you can get.

Choreographed Man of War,Robert Pollard and His Soft Rock Renegades,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cd9d034d5c69bf27e8/1:1/w_160/b1a04388.gif,2001-10-12 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6380-choreographed-man-of-war/,RockathonRecordheadRockathonRecordhead,"Dayton, Ohio, 1968. A 10-year-old boy creeps through the dimly-lit hallways of his house. He checks every room twice-- yes, mommy and daddy are still at the grocery store. He's all alone. He sneaks into the kitchen, and drags the stool from the corner of the room over to the kitchen table. Slowly, he climbs up onto it, then onto the table itself, trying as hard as he can not to knock anything over. He grabs his Mattel Superstar Microphone, and shouts at the top of his prepubescent lungs, ""This song is called... 'Poopy on the Potty of Professor Plum,' from the album Little Puppy in My Front Yard! One, two, three, four!"" Yes, it's always entertaining to think of little Robert Pollard shouting ridiculous song titles from atop his kitchen table. But it's also funny to think that, as he nears middle-age, Robert Pollard has a career standing in front of amorous crowds and saying, ""This song is called... 'Gold Star for Robot Boy,' from the album Bee Thousand! One, two, three, four!"" Considering that Pollard was working away at excellent tunes like ""Weed King"" before he even approached his teenage years, saying that Pollard never really grew up as a songwriter is sure as fucking hell not an insult. When I was that age, the best song I could come up with was called ""Mean Mole,"" about a mean mole who's ""Not like a genie/ He's a real meanie."" Even my 7-year-old peers thought it was pretty weak. It's been said again and again that Pollard's more recent work has been indicative of a more mature type of songwriting. But while his lyrics and music certainly have taken a darker, more adult-oriented turn, Pollard still seems fascinated with living out his big rock fantasy. Isolation Drills, though more lyrically personal than any GBV record before it, still relied greatly on larger-than-life arena rock hooks, resulting in a pretty good rock record, but one that didn't much deliver in the way of conveying the introspective sadness expressed in its lyrics. Choreographed Man of War, played by Pollard, bassist Greg Demos, and Drummer Jim MacPherson (all of whom appeared on Do the Collapse), couples Pollard's newly discovered introspection with a more stripped-down, melodic sound. And the result could very well be Pollard's most promising solo record since Waved Out. ""I Drove a Tank,"" a song which has become a staple at GBV shows, provides a shaky start for a surprisingly solid album. Opening with a riff that borrows the rhythm from the classic ""Postal Blowfish,"" the song shifts quickly into a hook that's perhaps the most blatantly Who-sounding moment ever to grace a Pollard LP. ""I Drove a Tank"" may actually have benefited greatly from the Schnapf treatment that was given to Isolation Drills, as the present version, with its meandering, sloppy mid-section, doesn't do the arena-sized hook justice. Choreographed Man of War's first true standout comes with ""Edison's Memos,"" one of only two tracks on the album to break the four-minute mark, and one of the finest melancholy rock songs Pollard has ever written. With a gorgeous verse and brief, rocking chorus, ""Edison's Memos"" kicks off to a brilliant start, before degrading slightly with a gratuitously fuzzed-out bridge, and redeeming itself with the introduction of another awesome big-rock hook. ""7th Level Shutdown,"" another excellent track, crystallizes the vague melancholy of ""Edison's Memos."" With its heart-wrenching chorus of, ""You wanted to be alone/ But I don't want you to be alone,"" ""7th Level Shutdown"" is the most direct, beautifully reflective song Pollard has penned in ages. ""Aeriel"" is similarly gorgeous, excepting the two-minute instrumental introduction that makes the track rather hard to swallow. On the more cheerful side of Choreographed Man of War is ""Kickboxer Lightning,"" a breezy rock tune with a feel similar to that of ""Drag Days"" off Under the Bushes Under the Stars. GBV vet Greg Demos' melodic yet understated bass-playing helps make ""Kickboxer Lightning"" a seriously great rock song. The similarly rocking ""Bally Hoo"" begins somewhat awkwardly, but goes on to revisit the hook from ""I Drove a Tank"" with an added guitar hook big enough to make Pete Townshend notice. And he's nearly deaf, you know. As is the case with most GBV-related albums, Choreographed Man of War is not without its throwaways and failed experiments. But the record's significance seems to transcend the overall quality of the songs-- this is truly the first album in Bob Pollard's recent canon on which he seems willing to lay off of the crunchy riffage to let some genuine melodic beauty and emotion seep through. Perhaps he's finally learned that if you're hanging your head in sadness, you can't do a high-kick without kneeing yourself in the face.","Dayton, Ohio, 1968.

Carnival Folklore Resurrection 7: Libyan Dream,Sun City Girls,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5aa9d034d5c69bf3350/1:1/w_160/bdf23ad2.gif,2001-10-11 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7568-carnival-folklore-resurrection-7-libyan-dream/,Abduction,"Once, a few years ago, I co-managed a record store. One day, the owner asked me to put together a section of music devoted to music that no one will ever buy. Apparently, the rest of our stock hadn't collected enough dust, so a new section entitled ""You Won't Buy This, So Go Look at the Reggae"" was devised. Actually, that wasn't his exact request, but this was how it went down: Owner: Luke, this store needs a new section and you're going to put it together. Here's the one-stop catalog. Have fun! Me: What kind of music are we talking about here? Owner: Let's see. What are all these wacky hipster kids listening to these days? I know: put together an avant-garde section. Get me some freaky music. I want a section for all those weirdo hipster kids. Got it? Groovilicious. Me: [shrugs] Uh... Owner: Oh, yeah. Try and find something that sounds like somebody dug up a bunch of graves and started beating the skulls together. And then they take apart the skeleton and beat the skulls with the bones from the arms and legs. Amazing! And so it began. I spent the next week circling titles in magazine reviews, scanning music guides, getting feedback from the customers who the owner had deemed ""a little out there,"" and going about this whole project in a state of bewilderment and confusion. I ended up putting together a list of 100 titles for the next order. Somewhere near the bottom was a band I'd heard mentioned a couple of times, always with a look of disgust on the person's face. I'd scribbled near the bottom, ""Sun City Girls - anything you can find,"" and faxed the list to our one-stop. Friday came and the first shipment arrived. A handful of titles from that order made it in with the next shipment, one of those being Sun City Girls' Midnight Cowboys from Ipanema. I ripped the shrinkwrap off and stuck it in the disc player. Unbeknownst to me at the time, I was listening to what was widely considered to be the worst release in the Girls' entire catalog. Still, I couldn't help laughing at the atrocious, sloppy covers of ""Fly by Night"" and ""Midnight at the Oasis."" More SCG titles steadily trickled into the store. No one bought them. Except me. Unleashed almost twenty years ago, the Sun City Girls have reveled in the role of trickster since the very beginning. Comprised of three members (brothers Rick and Alan Bishop, and Charles Gocher Jr.), the band is characterized most easily by their erratic impulsivity. In fact, the one element that has remained constant over the years is their unpredictability. Sure, there have been recurring themes: a heavy bent of Middle-Eastern musical tradition and mysticism, demon and goddess obsession (Kali), extended improvisational freak-outs, dreadful covers of classic rock standards, infrequent live shows, audience baiting, attempts at breaking down the barriers between performance and art, late-60s-inspired jazz composition, and campfire psycho-babble storytelling. But any attempt at pigeonholing them to a specific genre remains futile. One of America's most prolific and proficient underground bands, the Sun City Girls are a collector's nightmare. It's not just the sheer deluge of releases that has record fiends scouring the used bins; it's the limited availability. After a few initial releases on now-defunct Placebo Records, the band disappeared from public view and began to unfurl a mountain of cassette releases (sold exclusively at shows or via mail-order) under the tag Cloaven Radio. Resurfacing in 1990 with the vastly underrated Torch of the Mystics, Sun City Girls slowly built a cult following over the subsequent decade. Despite a few scattershot live appearances, an ever-expanding catalog, and extensive global traveling, the band has spent the last ten years languishing in relative obscurity. Nevertheless, they've maintained, for all intents and purposes, a fairly high profile recently. In what's purported to be a neverending series of releases, the Bishop & Gocher Girls have (over a 24-month span) begun to flood stores with a string of albums under the guise of Carnival Folklore Resurrection, each limited to 1000 copies on the band's own Abduction label. And with eight installations so far, the series shows no signs of slowing down. One of the most recent, Libyan Dream, is a perfect example of the band's ability to cover vastly different musical territories, often within the timeframe of just one track. The seventh disc in the series begins with a burst of brutal guitar and drum buzz as they cover Amboy Dukes' ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"" for the second time in their career. Busting out with trashy guitar solos and the brothers' dueling vocals, it's a raunchy, shameless update of Nugent's original. What follows is a run of tracks encompassing familiar territory for Sun City Girls fans: squealing garage guitar, sprawling, drugged-out instrumentals, frenetic Middle-Eastern fuzz, an update of ""The Vinegar Stroke"" from Torch of the Mystics, and a few improvisational takes. ""Instantaneous Decisions"" begins with what sounds like Middle-Eastern hillbillies chanting over Gocher's endearingly messy drumming, but then unfolds into an angular, jagged display of bass and guitar. Each sudden burst of noise is followed by a series of nonsense squawks and yells from the band members. At times, the track falls apart at the seams; at others, Gocher and Rick Bishop maintain a stunningly open dialogue between guitar and drums. Most of the album, excepting the Amboy Dukes' update and an ode to opium, is instrumental, and it's an astonishing display of the Girls' musical adeptness. ""Sangkala Suite"" is a stunning, seven-plus-minute reworking of a traditional Middle Eastern tune that incredibly begins with a riff that sounds lifted by Dean Ween for ""Mr. Would You Please Help My Pony?"" Filled with the transcendent play and musical banter of a band that sounds truly enamored with the music they're making, it's a staggeringly beautiful piece. Unlike many of the other compositions and noise workouts here, ""Sangkala"" comes close to being, dare I say, inviting. What follows are two short tracks-- the acoustic ""Tavoy Salon"" and the hyper-charged Eastern blowup ""Opium Den""-- and the amazing, Rick Bishop opus ""Libyan Dream."" Clocking in at almost fifteen minutes, it's a forum for Bishop's skills. Incorporating styles from across the globe and referencing everything from flamenco to rock to raga, Bishop proves that, contrary to what some have said, the Sun City Girls are no joke. Dismissed for years as a noise outfit, a novelty, and a band incapable of playing their instruments, the elusive girls from Sun City remain surrealist masters of disguise. A career that spans nearly two decades is testament to their ferocious and uncompromising nature. They've done it all, from puerile pranks (Midnight Cowboys from Ipanema) to politically charged rants (Horse Cock Phephner) to campfire hillbilly freakouts (Jack's Creek). Carnival Folklore Resurrection may be an attempt to clean house and empty the vaults, but if this is the bottom of the barrel, the Girls have got me hooked. As the Nuge said so well in ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"": ""Come along if you can, come along if you dare..."" See you in the ticket line.","Once, a few years ago, I co-managed a record store. One day, the owner asked me to put together a ...

Change Is on Its Way,Three 4 Tens,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a791ea9e61561daa55fb/1:1/w_160/c90fac8e.gif,2001-10-11 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8031-change-is-on-its-way/,File-13,"Time travel is a concept that has fascinated many throughout history, with time machines coming to the fore of wishlists in the late 1800s as authors like H.G. Wells penned fantastic stories about scientists who'd perfected the ability to move freely from era to era with the aid of wondrous devices. Today, scientists are legitimately discussing the possibly of travel in a fourth dimension, though the systems that seem possible are a lot less flexible. One current project involves the idea that if you were to create a vortex of accelerated particles and step into it, you may be able to transport yourself back to the point at which the machine was turned on, essentially looping time back to the point of the device's creation. I don't really know the physics involved (I read about it in the newspaper several months ago), but I do know that, while interesting theoretically, such a device would be useless on a practical level. Evidence is quickly suggesting that the geekiest among us may as well abandon their fantasies of scoring with eloy chicks by day and battling vicious morlocks by night. Astoundingly, and in strict defiance of current science, it seems the Three 4 Tens have somehow managed to procure a working flux capacitor. And in a truly devious move, they've used it to travel to 1967 and steal the master tapes to the newly completed full-length of some poor, unsuspecting garage band. Sure, their story-- that they formed in Philly in 1996 and released a seven-song EP and a couple seven-inches soon thereafter, and that this is their bona fide ""debut album""-- may sound convincing, but I don't buy it for a second. This stuff just sounds way too authentic. However, assuming that it really is a modern recording, it's the band's uncanny authenticity that saves Change Is on Its Way from simple-minded pastiche. There are a lot of 60s throwback records kicking around out there, but few evoke long, unwashed hair, a two-car garage, and a Dodge Challenger parked on the front lawn quite as well as this one. The Three 4 Tens may not be from the 60s, but they fairly drip its essence. It's as though they've never heard anything outside of the British Invasion and the Nuggets box-set, with the possible exception of a chance encounter with Beulah or the Essex Green. Producer Paul Smith, who's also worked with Marah and Steve Earle in the past, even joins in, lending the band a sound extremely similar to that of a typical psych record you'd find reissued on Gear Fab and reviewed somewhere near the back of Record Collector. Cheap organs, low-budget wah, and droning sitars ooze out of every available nook in the band's sound, providing an incredibly apt bed for the guys to lay their thick four-part harmonies down upon. Even while reveling almost entirely in a bygone era, Change Is on Its Way isn't an unoriginal record. It simply owes a crushing debt to another time that many simply won't be able to forgive. For those who choose to take the ride, though, it's a pretty cool trip. There are monster hooks hanging off virtually every track here, and you're guaranteed to have at least one of them roosting in your brain for a while after the disc stops spinning. ""Right on Time"" ramrods its melody into your long-term memory with thudding tom-toms and bouncy basslines, trumping the Apples in Stereo at their own retro-fetish game. The band steps a little further into the void with ""Ostinato Raga,"" a raging, swirling mantra beset by marauding guitars which swoop in from above like peregrine falcons honing in on their prey. And it wouldn't be going too far out on a limb to assume that George is their favorite Beatle, given the omnipresence of droning textures on the album. The band do Todd Rundgren and the Nazz proud with ""Little Dove,"" dropping an economical guitar solo into the middle of a soup of catchy harmonies and rampaging backbeats. ""A Red Shirt Today"" bears a certain similarity to the Olivia Tremor Control's ""Hilltop Procession"" (due mostly to the way the vocals are recorded), but the harpsichords in the verse clearly swim over from the Left Banke. This gives way to the album's closer, the bizarre ""Bent Leg Chant,"" a jaunty, discordant sea shanty. In terms of execution, the Three 4 Tens seem to have used some pretty high-quality equipment to get themselves back in time, perhaps sharing an apparatus with similarly skilled borrowers the Essex Green. But whereas the Essex Green tap the folk/hippie tree for their brand of transcendent nostalgia, the Three 4 Tens channel the spirit of the British Invasion through the swirling psychedelia of the Electric Prunes and the Chocolate Watchband to create some truly arresting music. I haven't heard the trick pulled off this well since XTC released their Dukes of Stratosphear project in 1985. Somewhere back in 1967, there's a band that just recorded a damn fine album, wondering where the hell their tapes went, oblivious to the fact that the sneaky bastards in the Three 4 Tens will one day release it under another name. For their part, the Tens themselves can plunder the past all they want, and though it may never amount to anything innovative or truly essential, it'll sure as hell be enjoyable.","Time travel is a concept that has fascinated many throughout history, with time machines coming to the fore of wishlists ...

I just bought some nice zip-up knee-lengths myself, and now spend my days on the streets comparing them to those of other girls. Did I get the right pair, with buckles in just the right place? Will they become spring fashion castaways? Could all that money have gone to more superfluous records with which I could compare this album? Probably not, 'cause I got 'em all: the Stooges, the Modern Lovers, the Velvet Underground (in their first wave), and all those second-generation rip-offs I wholeheartedly love, against my better judgment. Vue appeared in the late 90s amidst the quote-unquote glam revival which you may recall as a media conspiracy centered around Ewan MacGregor's final stab at babeness, Velvet Goldmine. At that time, the shoes were platforms (mid-calf and often more round at the tip, unless chased with mod, in which case, we went for the Beetle-boots). Vue's riding rigs were a bit more glittery back then-- their 1999 debut EP for Gold Standard Laboratories, The Death of a Girl, and their self-titled Sub Pop releases frequently garnered comparison to Pulp or Jonathan Fire*Eater. Lots of people ate it up, but of course, the contrarian types at Pitchfork smelled a sequin-studded rat and slid both efforts into the pan. Well, now's now and everybody like the Strokes, the White Stripes, et al. Detroit will save America with its big, bad rhythms and no one cares how contrived the lot is. Enter the new Vue album, a slam-damned, roots rockin', acoustic growlin' Jaggermonica explosion of the righteous past. But let's be honest here: all those words I just reeled off mean absolutely nothing. That's the point. This is rock! From the border-skipping ruse of ""Hitchhiking"" to ""Do You Think of Him Still?,"" there's that heavy-handed sexuality, and that grotesque pout so associated with collagen-laden chic types and yesterday's real deal (ahh, glam again). These moments are certainly shameless, but nothing compared to ""People on the Stairs,"" which shivers from its naked exposure as a cosmetically lifted ""Sister Ray."" Still, they're pretty good at it. Frontman Rex John Shelverton, a guy who must sleep in a proper little tie, appropriates Jagger in much the way Christian Slater copped Nicholson's trademarks. It's locked in. Distortion prevails, mixing keys and blues guitars in that perfect blend of mud to snazz. It's so real I want to go up to it in a lobby and touch its leaves just to be sure, or scratch it along a window like a shady fiancée. But I know, as far as anything goes, that the appearance of ""authenticity"" is a construct (any time spent reading about Lou Reed's supposedly beat life will tell you that) and perhaps all this tittering about sonic opportunism is just so much revisionist righteousness. What? I mean to say, this album rocks shamelessly in this autumn's boots and cares not. That's just what they do. I guess this makes me a contrarian's contrarian, or perhaps just another fashion victim.","I hear rootsy R&B; is in this year, along with equestrian-style boots. I just\n\ bought some nice zip-up ...

Hey! Bob! My Friend!,Polysics,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e113d19756521384d2/1:1/w_160/16c42844.gif,2001-10-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6397-hey-bob-my-friend/,Asian Man,"Meet the Polysics. The beautiful impossible super-wonderful 100% Tokyo new wave mutant Polysics. Enigmatic as they are, they've at least given us clues as to what they're listening to. Their website is named Neu! Their latest Japanese full-length is entitled Eno. The cover art of Hey! Bob! My Friend!-- a scraped-up man popping through a serrated tin can hat-- is strikingly reminiscent of Frank Zappa's immortal Weasels Ripped My Flesh. They've been known to don matching plastic safety coveralls and industrial goggles for live performances, garnering incessant comparisons to their self-proclaimed gods, Devo. This junk drawer of band trivia provides a rough outline-- japanoise, grand synthetic fusion, electro-pop, propulsive motorik, and spastic digi-geek new wave. Gradually, they're coming into focus. So meet the Polysics. They've come to make rock uncool again. And they are unstoppable. Originally founded as a quartet in March 1997, the Polysics (reduced to a trio shortly after their first album) have already released four albums, a handful of EPs, several live videos, a two-disc remix/live album, and scattered vinyls, and have also appeared on some half-dozen compilations. Rumor has it that their trademark hazard-orange ""P"" can be spotted all over Tokyo, and that their absolutely manic recording energy is merely a spill-off from their dangerously volatile shows. Their first stateside release, Hey! Bob! My Friend!, is actually a compilation of material culled largely from their first two albums, but you'd never know it. The entire record pulses with the same nervous energy: clinical lab-coat-and-clipboard sterility married to frenetic dork rage. ""Sunnymaster"" bleeps in with thin, icy drum-machine loops and demented video game melodies before exploding into pummeling guitar noise that's more easily likened to K.K. Null than anything that might, for a moment, be considered new wave. This metallic assault lays the groundwork for the immediate ""Buggie Technicha,"" whose vocoded vocals sputter incomprehensibly over furious riffage, eventually resolving into some kind of metal-surf game show theme. Zappa's ghost haunts these proceedings. At concerts, Zappa would cup both bands between his legs and make the ""big balls"" sign, signaling his band to change whatever they were playing into ludicrous heavy metal aggression; he'd twist an imaginary braid on the side of his head and they would shift on the fly into reggae. That kind of stylistic schizophrenia dominates Hey! Bob! Cool electro-pop becomes white-hot noise becomes sloppy, grinding no wave becomes logarithmic computer sequences. Like an atmosphere re-entry in some bad sci-fi movie, everything will be okay, as long as they can just hold it together. The infectious ""Plus Chicker"" is jagged and punkish, yet dominated by Hiroyuki Hayashi's (aka POLY-1) loose, high-pitched vocals and Kayo's (aka POLY-3) squiggly synthesizers. ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Married to a Frenchman"" pay the most loving tribute to their idols in Devo-- not the quirky, clean, MTV-era Devo, but the brash, no wave-inflected Devo of the late 70s. Beneath the sugary vocals and zipping electronic pops and squeaks lurk fierce percussion and edgy, distorted guitars cranking out measured belligerence. It dances but it bites. And spaz is king. Hey! Bob! My Friend! simply flails, throbs and convulses with abandon, shifting from Boredoms to Falco and back again at will. One isn't likely to find this kind of frenetic exuberance elsewhere this year. Hey! Bob! sputters and chatters like a toy chest filled with spastic, plastic, blinking, bleeping robots, discharging missiles and spouting digitized catchphrases. Sounds like fun, right? It's as serious as a heart attack.","Meet the Polysics. The beautiful impossible super-wonderful 100% Tokyo new wave mutant Polysics. Enigmatic as they are, they've at ...

Corridors and Parallels,David S. Ware Quartet,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9d25e6ef959693214a2/1:1/w_160/77093948.gif,2001-10-10 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8583-corridors-and-parallels/,AUM Fidelity,"Ex-Magnet writer Phil Freeman picked a prescient title for his recent book. More so than ever (if possible): New York is Now. Subtitled The New Wave of Free Jazz, Freeman's book sketches the Big Apple's current scene from the enthusiastic perspective of a former metalhead. The sprawling landscapes of cacophony, both that of the scene and the chaos at the former World Trade Center concourse, aren't so much analogies for each other as much as they are reflections of the increasingly complex geometry of the City. Too bad Freeman wasn't more influenced by these flexible avenues; he might have written something more encompassing, and less two-dimensional. His gossipy account of attending a recording session for the new David S. Ware Quartet album is amusing in its fanboy chatter, of course, but the bubble of epic mystery in that final chapter is burst when you hear the mixed results of the final product. Corridors & Parallels does appear to have all the hallmarks of an artistic tectonic shift. It's tenor saxophonist David Ware's first album in years on a smaller label. Plus, Matthew Shipp controversially abandons his usual role as the group's pianist to play a Korg synthesizer filled with preset sound effects while bassist William Parker and drummer Guillermo E. Brown make for a tight backbone. Thematically, the album begins and ends with (and is divided down the middle by) untitled interludes. And then there's the marquee song titles, like ""Straight Track"" and ""Jazz Fi-Sci."" ""Straight Track"" features Shipp's choppy, flute-like synth, Parker's washboard plucking, and Brown's rainstick-mimicking, cymbal-showering drums, clearly conscious of the presence of former band member (and recent Yo La Tengo touring percussionist) Susie Ibarra. A minute passes, then two, three-- the pun is almost audible: where's Ware? After four minutes, the hornet buzz of his tenor finally appears. This would have been the perfect place to test the cool of the Korg with the frantic sax, but for some mind-boggling reason, Shipp sits on his hands for another few minutes. Eight, and the convergence comes too late-- synth and sax meet for just a moment at the apex of this bloated ten-minute track, and everything grinds to a halt seconds later. ""Jazz Fi-Sci"" moves along a similar axis. Ware and Brown hammer away at incredible speeds. Then, they pause completely, as Shipp keys a sequence of madcap electronic arpeggios and gritty noise. Same parallels-- electronic and organic lines never cross. It's fun, and Ware's desperate bleating sounds wild, but the track title and the artificial partitions scream ""gimmick!"" from a thousand miles away. The frustrating part is that Isotope 217 have done this type of fusion in an infinitely more relevant, yet irreverent manner. Another good/not-so-good parallel: the two songs on this album with preprogrammed rhythms tracks. ""Superimposed"" employs the kind of pseudo-African-influenced drum lines heard in 80s radio pap or ""zoom-zoom-zoom"" car commercials. The wailing hip-hop whistle doesn't exactly do much to freshen things up, and all of Ware's tight-lipped squeals and extended wails don't make up for this dank retro. The title track fares slightly better, if only because Parker's ultra-low-end, cello-like playing and Ware's slower, more deliberate style dominate the drum loops they stole from 808 State's closet. The best cuts are the least predictable. Despite their brevity, the three untitled interludes are full of intrigue. Parker's bass takes eerie prominence (especially important because he's often drowned out elsewhere), and the last track is mixed so effectively that Brown's sticks sound unnervingly like they're tapping on the inner rim of your headphones. ""Sound-a-Bye"" develops like an elaboration on these pieces. Here, Ware plays about as slowly as possible, the sustained drone of his sax complemented nicely by Shipp whose keys now plink with clipped accents. The intensity matches the voluminous soundscapes of Spring Heel Jack's Masses project, which all but Ware contributed to. And the alien harmony of ""Somewhere"" strains comprehension, each musician struggling to make their instrument sound like anything but itself. ""Mother May You Rest in Bliss"" ends the album proper with an emotional tempest that was sorely lacking up to this point. Dedicated to his mom, Lucille, the elegy is led by Ware's incredibly lyrical delivery, a soulful solo complemented by Shipp's synths which seem to channel Moby's ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters."" I'll leave it to the listener to decide whether the good half of an album makes it worth the purchase. Unfortunately, the other half weakens all its supports with some tacky choices regarding sound palettes and dynamics-- deconstruction in the least clever sense, far from Phil Freeman's comparison of Corridors & Parallels to the Orb.

Fahrenheit Fair Enough,Telefon Tel Aviv,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74d5e6ef95969320f3f/1:1/w_160/ca9bccac.gif,2001-10-10 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7962-fahrenheit-fair-enough/,Hefty,"For guys who've worked closely with Nine Inch Nails, Telefon Tel Aviv's Charles Cooper and Josh Eustis sound remarkably calm and contemplative. Far from being an album of corporately bloated, manufactured angst, Fahrenheit Fair Enough is so laid back that it's permanently supine. Cooper and Eustis have previously worked on remixes with Nine Inch Nails' Danny Lohner, who's responsible for tracks such as A Perfect Circle's ""Judith"" and ""The Hollow,"" as well as Eminem's ""The Way I Am."" In addition to collaborating on a glitchy remix of NIN's ""Where is Everybody?"" (on the Things Falling Apart remix EP), the pair have also contributed to ""Even Deeper,"" which will appear on the soundtrack to the John and James Hughes high school road movie, Newport South. Though the contemplative vibe of Fahrenheit Fair Enough raises eyebrows, given the band's previous production credits, John Hughes' Hefty label is a perfect home for Telefon Tel Aviv. The band, now supporting Godspeed You Black Emperor and Califone on tour, are comfortably (in fact, sometimes too comfortably) similar to Scott Herren's Savath and Savalas project and, all too infrequently, the seismic waves of Italian glitchworkers Retina. Kicking off with the title track, Cooper and Eustis perform their deft impersonation of the lulling, tastefully echoed tones of the Album Leaf. An electronic piano makes deliberated, pseudo-profound statements before the Warp-descended posse of percussion squiggles, bips, blips, and blops take up their squirmy position by the e-piano. These opposites never attract. Though a steady backbeat keeps both time and order, Cooper and Eustis are forced into using a calliope-like sound to bring any beauty to this ill-conceived pairing. A slightly Oval-processed electric piano opens ""TTV,"" but it's the malfunctioning, algorithmic percussion that holds the field before Cooper and Eustis let a solo flute furnish the track with sentimental elegance. ""Lotus above Water"" initially features dapplings of efx-laden guitars and a Matthew Herbert-style sample-anything atmosphere. The duo tones down those noodly ambiences when they engage a subdued kickdrum, but at 3\xBD minutes, the track's too short to build any real steam. ""John Thomas on the Inside Is Nothing but Foam"" isn't only heavily indebted to Millions Now Living-period Tortoise, but is also a near-identical twin of Savath and Savalas' ""Conditioning."" The guitar melodies rise and fall with studied grace and a pitiable yearning to be admired, but we've heard these stereotypical post-rock figures a million times. And I think it's safe to say that the duo hasn't been comatose or listening to Slayer albums since Slint disbanded. ""Life Is All about Taking Things in and Putting Things Out"" never gets beyond the oblique strategy of its title. A grand piano impersonates ambient composer Harold Budd, but to avoid unfavorable comparisons with Budd's The Plateaux of Mirrors, Cooper and Eustis allow ambient spectral roars to wander through the mix. Perhaps Trent Reznor advised them to do that. Telefon Tel Aviv achieve some degree of distinction with ""Your Face Reminds Me of When I Was Old."" Beginning like a sound sculpture, Cooper and Eustis bring clattering, curling elements to the foreground and allow them to loiter and interact with each other. Elsewhere, real instruments and software-generated noises exist in an apartheid of non-engagement. Because the distinction between ""real"" and ""virtual"" is erased on ""Your Face,"" Eustis and Cooper capture the essence of Savath and Savalas' success. Though Fahrenheit Fair Enough includes nothing incisive or insightful, it's nonetheless an intriguing release. Annoying as the album frequently is, it doesn't irritate through ham-fistedness or incompetence. But it's somewhat frustrating because, while the duo occasionally displays the beauty they're truly capable of, they generally settle for a disappointing simulacrum. Next time out, they'll be that much further away from Trent Reznor, and that much nearer to getting it right.","For guys who've worked closely with Nine Inch Nails, Telefon Tel Aviv's Charles\n\ Cooper and Josh Eustis ...

"Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970): It's About That Time",Miles Davis,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bac0084474cd0c0ebe/1:1/w_160/245dda05.gif,2001-10-10 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2197-live-at-the-fillmore-east-march-7-1970-its-about-that-time/,Columbia,"Would you know greatness if you saw it? This is the eternal question for people like me, posting their supposedly well thought-out pontifications for anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to read. The issue of being able to distinguish what's good from what isn't seems like a job ill-suited for anyone who doesn't have the power of omniscience, or at least a good track record with uncovering genius. And yet, this is a request made by artists all the time-- that of acceptance, or some kind of recognition of what they've produced. Maybe it's not really a matter of taste, but closer to keen perception and foresight. But while some folks may pride themselves in their ability to find interesting art, it takes popular consensus to brand a piece or work ""great"" or ""revolutionary."" Herein lies the dilemma: if you aren't able to recognize the inherent greatness of a particular piece of art, how can you appreciate any art at all? Or, if you do think you see genius somewhere, how do you communicate this to somebody else? These are the kinds of questions I have for the audience assembled for the Miles Davis Quintet performance at the Fillmore East in New York City on March 7th, 1970. Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970): It's About That Time is the official release of an oft-bootlegged performance of Davis' ""lost quintet."" His cohorts were Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette and Airto Moreira. Not a bad lineup for a band that never existed, save a few fiery performances in 1969 and 1970. In fact, at the time, the status of Davis' proper quintet (featuring Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and Shorter) was a little hazy. Williams had left to run his own show with Lifetime, but Hancock and Carter would continue to play with the trumpeter on and off for a couple of years. Also, the issue of the new quintet actually being a sextet added to the confusion of just who, exactly, was a part of Davis' band. One other oddity confronted the lucky few who were able to witness these guys live: almost all the music being played was unreleased, and unlike anything ever produced by jazz musicians. Most of the tunes performed at this Fillmore date (not to be confused with another release, Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East, recorded in June of the same year) were from the landmark Bitches Brew LP. Although Bitches Brew had been recorded the previous summer, it wouldn't be released until a few weeks after this performance. And as any of that album's millions of fans will tell you, its music isn't really the kind that sinks in on the first listen. The Davis Quin/Sextet was opening for Steve Miller and Neil Young for these sets. But if the jazz community was bitterly divided over the notion of Miles Davis playing ""rock"" music, I can only imagine what was going through the heads of people accustomed to hearing ""Cinnamon Girl,"" rather than ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,"" for an encore. Judging by the audience response here, they probably didn't really know what to think. The applause is polite, but hesitant, and the two or three guys who wanted more at the end may have been anomalies, because it was pretty obvious the band had left it all onstage after the last number. To recognize greatness: it is elusive, and most likely, beyond the sensibilities of most hippies and/or mere mortals. The first set begins as Holland, DeJohnette and Corea vamp to a furious funk groove. Heavy bass and some well-placed exotic percussion (supplied by the redoubtable Moreira, whose playing receives the ultimate dis by being labeled ""superfluous"" in the liner notes) kick things off, and by the time Davis enters, the brew is already quite hot. The tune is ""Directions,"" and apparently, it refers to many at once. Miles seems to be aiming straight for the jugular while Holland takes the straight and steady, and when Shorter comes in, he leads DeJohnette and Corea on a path so ridden with turbulence and strife, it derails the entire tune. About five minutes in, it becomes impossible to remember that most of these same musicians had produced something like In a Silent Way, only a year earlier. Afterwards, the band segues into ""Spanish Key,"" one of the more straightforward pieces on Bitches Brew, but here already transformed into a three-headed monster by a band that obviously couldn't sit still on a bet. The three heads in question: a rhythm section which never actually came down from the highs of the previous rave, Davis, who was playing more aggressively and with more muscle than he ever had, and Wayne Shorter, who was playing like he never would again. Of course, he wouldn't, at least with Davis. After this date, Shorter would leave the group to form the seminal fusion outfit Weather Report. When he first performed with Davis in the early 60s, he'd received the rap of being a Coltrane disciple (not a criticism, really), but had always possessed a natural calm that his spiritual mentor would discard in favor of pure expression and, often, fury. On this date, Shorter meets his maker, full of fire and machine gun lines on soprano and tenor sax that had only been hinted at on the great releases by the second Davis Quintet. During the second set, whatever jazz history had not been rewritten got its due and then some. ""Directions"" (it appears twice, since these two discs document both an early and a late show) starts off innocently enough, with a low, humming growl from Holland, but quickly develops into the Apocalypse. There are moments when the music seems to cross over into the avant-garde and free jazz realms, especially whenever Shorter is playing a solo. Reportedly, Davis never considered himself a part of those camps, but it's clear he wasn't afraid to let his band steer the ship in that general direction, so long as they kept the groove alive. Corea brings it down a little with a few choruses of comparatively traditional playing, even if it isn't less intense than the others'. The tune segues into ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down""; very different, far greasier and Fatter (with a capital 'F,' as you can see) than the studio version on Bitches Brew. It could almost pass for hard blues-rock, if not for DeJohnette's relentless cymbal attack and Davis' distorted howling. Here, though, it seems to serve as a kind of breather so the band can rev up for ""Bitches Brew,"" arguably in its finest version anywhere on this CD. It begins with ominous, woozy percussion, and some agitated horn punches from the leader. Then, out of nowhere, everything gets funky. Holland lays down some serious dirty pimp low end, filtered through that infamous ""ring modulation"" to give it the extra ass-mangling quality so desired in serious jazz performance. After a bit, Shorter drops another trip-bop bomb, and then the quiet comes back. Davis takes it out with a few quick, muted jabs, while the beat simmers below. And if I never heard another track by that band again, I'd still rank them alongside Davis' other classic groups. The set ends with a version of ""It's About That Time"" (from In a Silent Way), spliced with something called ""Willie Nelson."" The first part takes the original and applies the underlying aggression of this set to its once peaceful groove. The second half takes the bottom out, and showcases at once the band's penchant for repetitive riffing and complete irreverence towards the way jazz solos were supposed to be played (I'm not sure there's a straight chord progression on the entire record). When the track is over, the audience, who probably weren't sure of what had just happened, offers cautious appreciation via some very polite applause. The emcee announces the group again (Miles never spoke during performances), and there are a couple of calls for an encore. Moreira lets everyone know it's over by blowing his whistle, and I surmise that many of the people there were letting out sighs of relief. There's no way to know if they were aware of the jazz revolution starting right under their noses. Over thirty years later, I'm not sure I understand what the preceding hour-and-a-half was all about, except what I consider exceptional musicians taking exceptional chances. It's undoubtedly pointless trying to reduce music to levels of ""genius,"" so from now on, I'll take whatever those guys had to say without much inclination of trying to put it into words.","Would you know greatness if you saw it?

The Worst of...,Black Box Recorder,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ceb1335d7bf1698593/1:1/w_160/32d2ac97.gif,2001-10-10 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/740-the-worst-of/,Jetset,"In the average lifetime, a human in an industrialized nation will spend three and a half years eating, six months on the toilet, and twelve years watching TV. We'll grow an average of two meters of nasal hair, kiss for two full weeks, and blink 415 million times. These are just a few of the various facts of life proffered in Black Box Recorder's video for ""The Facts of Life,"" one of four included on the multimedia portion of The Worst of Black Box Recorder. Consider those facts for a second. Over the course of a lifetime, that's a lot of television, and not a whole lot of kissing. It's enough to make you want to skip those 3:00 a.m. reruns of ""Dear John"" and give someone close to you a quick peck to set things right. The members of Black Box Recorder-- Ex-Auteur Luke Haines, former Jesus and Mary Chain drummer John Moore, and vocalist Sarah Nixey-- seem to have mundanities like this on their minds a lot, taking the state of modern life and weaving it into a manifesto of wry observations and stinging commentary. You can almost consider their songs to be the black box recording of our decadent, materialistic society's final moments, before our engines fail and we crash into a churning sea of revolution (or, at least, recession). Considering that most of these songs were written a few years ago, it's amazing how well Luke Haines' pre-millennial tension translates to the changed world we've been living in for the past month. The Worst of Black Box Recorder opens with a gleeful, airy romp through Jacques Brel's ""Seasons in the Sun"" (originally a bonus track from the U.S. edition of their debut, 1998's England Made Me), which essentially sums up the band's output with its sunny melody and absolutely morbid lyrics. The sound is totally straight-faced, yet you can picture the band cracking a smile at their own gallows humor as Nixey's ultra-femme voice caresses the simple arrangement. Initially, I questioned the appropriateness of Black Box Recorder releasing a b-sides compilation after only two albums, but The Worst Of proves itself largely worthy over the course of its twelve tracks. It's definitely the trio's most varied release, and it serves as a decent introduction to their discography. U.S. fans might have reservations, though, as anyone who owns the domestic versions of their two proper albums already owns six of these songs. Still, it's nice to hear some of the band's grittier moments after last year's incredibly smooth The Facts of Life, which occasionally steered a little too close to adult contemporary territory for my ears. The majority of this disc, on the other hand, is uptempo, and actually feels a little more designed for a mass audience than some of the band's a-sides. ""Lord Lucan is Missing"" and ""Start as You Mean to Go On"" possess the crunch of some of Haines' louder work with the Auteurs, like After Murder Park's ""Light Aircraft on Fire"" and ""Lenny Valentino"" from Now I'm a Cowboy. The off-kilter guitar figures of ""Watch the Angel, Not the Wire"" offset Nixey's sing-song vocals nicely as she expounds upon perception and free will. Another highlight is ""Brutality,"" a catchy, sugary-sweet tune lamenting the passage of ""doing the decent thing,"" and drinking and driving with equal reverence. Theremins whistle countermelodies in the background as palm-muted guitars nudge the rhythm along, interlocking with multi-layered analog synths, creating a song that's both gleefully subversive and eminently hummable. ""The Facts of Life,"" as remixed by Chocolate Layers (aka Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey from Pulp), is imbued with the icy chill that graced Pulp's ""Seductive Barry,"" while adding samples of children offering their theories on where babies come from, and the same masturbation instruction tape that Italy's Valvola sampled for ""Flashing Light."" ""You have to sit for a few minutes while the doctors phone up for the babies,"" says one little girl, hesitantly, before a seductive female voice coos about synching your body's reactions to obtain a perfect orgasm. Otherwise, the song is kept largely intact, and the remix actually improves a great deal upon the original. As previously mentioned, the multimedia portion of the disc tacks on four videos, the most noteworthy of which is, far and away, the aforementioned spot for ""The Facts of Life."" Along with the flashed statistics, it features Nixey as a school teacher with a penchant for form-fitting skirts, and two private school kids doing themselves up to the hilt in front of mirrors, only to walk right by each other at the end. The video for ""England Made Me"" gets the title of Most Disturbing, with Nixey's face appearing on dozens of bodies a la Richard D. James. (Well, it's not quite that disturbing, but it comes close.) So, thankfully, The Worst of Black Box Recorder turns out to be quite a misnomer. It's a good starting point for the uninitiated, and UK fans who held off on buying the singles will find it extremely rewarding. On the other hand, if you already own six of these songs, it's up to you to decide whether or not you're that much of a completist. Either way, The Worst of Black Box Recorder is a solid disc that showcases the band's range better than either of their albums, and a great soundtrack to have going while you're growing all that nasal hair.","In the average lifetime, a human in an industrialized nation will spend three and a half years eating, six months ...

Here's to Shutting Up,Superchunk,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d5b1335d7bf1698cc1/1:1/w_160/42c3dd9a.gif,2001-10-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7617-heres-to-shutting-up/,Merge,"Twelve years is a long time to hold a job. Any elderly engineer or factory worker can attest to the banality of the same tired day-to-day routines. Eventually, wasted months trail behind like a dense fog in your hazy memory, leaving you wondering if there was even any point to it all. Fortunately for Superchunk, their job entails being a highly influential rock band with a devoted fanbase, their own record label, and a legacy that most of the nation's wealthiest 1% would trade in their multi-millions for. For Superchunk, twelve years is a dream come true. Their humble beginnings as a small-time Chapel Hill pop band in 1989 have, over the years, given way to next-big-thing status, major label bidding wars, and eight studio albums, several of which have become heralded as indie classics. Now in their 30s, the long-standing lineup of Mac McCaughan, guitarist Jim Wilbur, bassist Laura Ballance and drummer Jon Wurster is still making music with the same heart of their early records, even while time has begun to change them into a subtler incarnation of their former selves. Signs of the new, more refined Superchunk first appeared on 1999's Jim O'Rourke-produced Come Pick Me Up with tracks like ""Tiny Bombs"" and ""Hello Hawk."" But they were just signs, as raucous, infectiously upbeat songs like ""Good Dreams"" and ""June Showers"" dominated the album with anthemic bliss. On Here's to Shutting Up, though, the once-tightly wound hyper heroes have foregone the distortion in lieu of smoothed-out balladry and reflective repose. While often sung from the point of view of fictional characters, McCaughan's lyrics on Here's to Shutting Up often reveal his wist for days gone by. This is perhaps most notable in one of the album's rare rockers, ""Out on the Wing,"" in which a person confides, ""All the music that I love is out of date/ So take me to the place/ Where there's no such thing as taste,"" a sentiment most thirty-something ex-music fans can bitterly relate to. Several of these songs also dwell on young love and history, such as the subdued, pedal-steel-infused ""Phone Sex,"" which addresses a teenager stood up for a date, and the despondent 7\xBD-minute-long ""What Do You Look Forward To,"" where McCaughan recalls seeing ""anticipation and a smile on the face of this girl/ And her mother through the glare on the glass of the windshield as they drove away."" But even though this album exhibits a softer, more melancholy side of Superchunk, a handful of old-school rockers fill the album out nicely. It's with one of these, the not-necessarily full-force, but nonetheless aggressive ""Art Class (Song for Yayoi Kusama),"" that the album's clear standout comes. Amidst a pounding rhythm section, McCaughan seems to deride art schools more than that classic time-wasting high school elective with lines like, ""Why so serious/ When it's only your life that's at stake/ Why so serious/ When your life is the art that you make,"" and, ""So shit in a can but your art is not free."" Elsewhere, the almost Guided by Voices-length slab of raging guitars and crashing drum fills, ""Rainy Streets,"" provides some early relief from the album's pensive meditations. Producer Brian Paulson, who worked with the band on 1993's Foolish, is back behind the decks for Here's to Shutting Up, and despite the band's maturing songcraft, his recording techniques give the record more of a classic Superchunk feel. Jim O'Rourke may have added some meaty soundwork to Come Pick Me Up, but Paulson seems more comfortable with the guys, mixing Mac McCaughan's still-boyish tenor amongst the instrumentation rather than up in your face. It's a seemingly small touch, but an unexpected one, and it makes all the difference in the album's long-term listenability. Of course, at the end of the day, Here's to Shutting Up isn't anything spectacular. The new direction of these songs seems logical enough, and will likely sit well with longtime fans who are, by now, also growing somewhat less excitable. Still, you can't help but miss the youthful ambition of Superchunk's glory days, when they seemed so relevant shouting out simple songs of love and boredom, and blared constantly from college stations across the country. On the other hand, twelve years is a long time to hold a job. It's just nice to see that they're still inspired by what they do.","Twelve years is a long time to hold a job.

The Fugue in the Fog,Apes,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0bdb1335d7bf16980b2/1:1/w_160/3389abb4.gif,2001-10-09 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/218-the-fugue-in-the-fog/,Frenchkiss,"Gorillas are the nice ones. You can teach a gorilla to speak in sign language, like the world-famous Koko. You can give a gorilla a kitten, and it will love and nurture it. It will give it a cute name like ""all ball"" or ""smoky."" Apes, on the other hand, are fucking vicious. You can sing to an ape, but it will only fling its dung in your face, pound its chest, and masturbate furiously. You can give an ape a kitten, but it will only beat it into a bloody, lifeless pulp, and then consume that pulp like a tasty milkshake. Or maybe my perception of Apes has been altered by this, the debut record from the sneering, posturing rockers bearing the name of the oft-maligned primates. For those of you who'd think it impossible to cock-rock without a guitar, the The Apes prove that having a chick with an organ (er...) can incline a band towards rocking out just as much as having a dirty guy with a ponytail on ""lead"" guitar. In fact, the organ works wonders for The Apes, filling out their sound to the point where it becomes a massive, towering entity that provides perfect backing for lead singer Paul Weil's spitting quasi-antics. I use the term ""quasi-antics"" because The Apes still seem to be working out what exactly their antics are. They like to say ""The Apes"" a lot. A lot of their songs have the word ""ape"" in them. At live shows, they speak of ""Sugar Mountain."" They wear camouflage gear, sometimes capes. Weil takes off his shirt, revealing his fine, chiseled body. No, really, he does have a fine, chiseled body, but that only makes the shirt-removal seem more gratuitous than that conducted by the less chiseled Tim Harrington of Les Savy Fav. Indeed, Les Savy Fav have some very close ties to The Apes-- they signed the band to bassist Syd Butler's Frenchkiss label, and are thanked in The Apes' final ""thank you's"" track, ""Apes Salute."" But musically, The Apes follow a path much more straightforward than that of their mentors. Les Savy Fav have an amazing knack for crafting dynamic, off-kilter punk songs; The Apes just want to rock. And rock they do. At its heart, The Fugue in the Fog is a simple riff-rock album. There's really not all that much in the way of vocal melody, as most of the vocals here are practically spoken and highly distorted. So the issue really comes down to the quality of the riffs themselves, and the songs containing these riffs. Unfortunately, The Fugue in the Fog doesn't succeed in its execution as much as it does in its setup. At times, the band's sheer energy carries the songs. And at other times, the songs are simply pretty damned good. ""Blood and Light,"" the album's most engaging track is, like most of the tracks here, based around a basic central riff. Thankfully, it varies enough to hold your interest. Quite simply put, it's a well-crafted rock song. The album's opener, ""Black Tears,"" is another fine example of The Apes fully exploring the potential of a single riff. Elsewhere on the album, however, the band tends to rely too heavily on the same played-out pentatonic scale techniques that have been rock staples pretty much since its inception. Led Zeppelin could get away with it 30 years ago, but today's demanding listener expects a bit more. As far as straight-up rock records go, though, The Fugue in the Fog is damned good. The Apes have forged a relatively distinctive sound, and cranked out a few seriously awesome songs. There's a ridiculous amount of potential here, but oftentimes that potential goes unexplored. Still, The Apes are, without question, entertaining. If they paid a little more attention to actually writing their songs, they could be downright dangerous.","Gorillas are the nice ones.

The Silver Sound Sessions EP,June Panic,by: Daphne Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4a5e6ef95969322b9b/1:1/w_160/d29cc435.gif,2001-10-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6142-the-silver-sound-sessions-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"How happy was I when I woke up one morning and realized no one cared about Kindercore anymore? College freshmen were now name-dropping Saddle Creek and adoring raw-driven honesty over the bravado of Brian Wilson and late-era Beatles. Shiver to think they drew blanks when asked about the relevance of Cornelius or that they didn't ride the Os Mutantes wave all the way to shore. Oh, but I did. Ah, 1997. I was there through it all-- those incredibly banal Kindercore concept albums about monkeys, forests, pastoral childhood, etc, etc, ad nauseam. Standing tall through the wasteland of incredibly poor album titles, toy percussion and mispronunciations of Moog, I'm admittedly jaded towards anything that smacks of mod-revivalist psych-pop. Which is why the first skim through June Panic's Silver Sound Sessions was somewhat disconcerting. Initially, the record seems to swell and bubble over with too-sincere, sweeping hooks. And then there's the guy's voice: too nasal to be suave, too reaching to qualify as straight pop. The clues momentarily spelt disaster. Elephant 6? The 'Core? No, only your average bedroom artist whose 11-year path has occasionally fallen victim to handclaps and silly melodies. That said, June Panic is a great songwriter whose sprawling list of solo records, EPs and compilation appearances have given him time to flesh out his skills and hone his craft. Now, after eight cassettes and three full-length albums, he comes through with The Silver Sound Sessions. The improvement is dramatic. Several of these songs downright grabbed my hand, went for the man-hug and ended up in the full embrace. There are certainly ties to such 'Sixers as Elf Power and Beulah, as well as a little Black Foliage-era Olivia Tremor Control (most noticeably on ""The Silver Sound""), but without the cloying pseudo-mystical bullshit OTC slathered between tracks on that album. For the most part, Panic muses on the standard pop topics, with emphasis on deceit and love-gone-wrong. The guy's obviously not out to change the world or anything-- in the traditional pop vein, his lyrics rhyme rather than going the reflective, rambling route that's stood for ages as a trademark of self-consciously ""important"" songwriters. And how about the music? The Silver Sound Sessions is primarily guitar-driven, and packed with lazy-river drumming and even the occasional eight-bars. Suffice to say, its charm isn't in the techs. ""(Bells) Ring Out the News"" carries a bar-room bassline and slithery blues. The opener, ""Travel Time,"" employs a snare backbone and sub-layers of horns that lie dormant underneath the track until near the end when they infiltrate and chaotically take over. All told, The Silver Sound Sessions is a pretty solid record coming from a guy with such a history of isolated bedroom emoting. Of course, it's not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination. But if nothing else, it beats Masters of the Hemisphere and the Marshmallow Coast.","How happy was I when I woke up one morning and realized no one cared about Kindercore anymore?

Jack, who showed up for the first time in these parts last night, is a bastard. He made me late for work by forcing me to scrape my windshield at 6:00 a.m. Robert, the sappy, mass-appeal scribe, is the Barry Manilow of poets. He has the dubious distinction of being the first object of scorn for most people after they develop their literary palate beyond the 6th grade level. That leaves Edith, tied with former Huskers quarterback Scott Frost, architect of one of the most spectacular last-minute, game-winning plays in NCAA history-- a deflected endzone desperation pass that propelled his team to the 1997 national championship. Actually, Edith and Scott have their similarities. Edith, too, came unexpectedly into the national spotlight in 1997, not on the strength of her right arm, but rather her critically acclaimed debut, Calling Over Time. And Scott was drafted by the Jets not as a quarterback, but instead to make the leap to defense in the strong safety position, which is faintly analogous to the change in direction in Edith's shake-'em-up sophomore effort, the psychedelic and electrified Telescopic, which many surprised fans took to be a veer off of the well-worn, singer/songwriter path she'd started down. But this is Pitchfork; we're not here to make clunky comparisons and stretched linkages (no, really). We're here to review quality music. And luckily, Edith's third full-length, this summer's mellifluously titled Wonder Wonder, has plenty of that. Half the tracks on the disc are upbeat, unbrooding affairs. Not rockers, but songs that aim for optimism and whimsy, and hit the mark dead center. Equally whimsical in the instrumentation, the album is sprinkled throughout with bells, chimes, shakers, and a cocktail of other percussive oddities, as well as a weird bass harmonica on a couple tracks that sounds like a dead-ringer for a baritone sax. The title track is perhaps a too-perfect example of both of these characteristics. Kitchen drawer-percussion horse-clops beneath a goofball bouncy beat and melody, driving the song along at a canter. A carefree clarinet solo is offbeat but still manages to be a perfect fit. When Frost dives into the swinging break, ""And always/ My wandering mind/ Takes me right down to the bottom of the basement,"" the smile is involuntary, and wide. ""Cars and Parties"" opens with bells and a military tattoo beat. Frost slurs lines like, ""Everytime I close my eyes/ I dream of someone in Texas/ And every strip mall along the highway/ Reminds me of my home,"" with equal parts feigned detachment and homesickness. This is one of those rare, perfectly balanced songs where the power of the lush-yet-catchy music is matched evenly by the power of the lyrics. The other half of the songs are so intimate that Frost could very well be standing behind you, whispering them into your left ear. On ""Dreamers,"" the first syllable Frost sings sounds so brittle and fragile it seems about to shatter into ice crystals at any moment. The chordal opener of ""True"" is graceful, buoyant, and gently fingerpicked, and ""Hear My Heart,"" one of Frost's earliest compositions, each tweak my voyeuristic streak. Edith uses her voice like a paint stripper, flaking away the artifice, leaving only the base primer coat of her raw emotion. The songs sound so tenderly personal at times, I experience peeping-Tom guilt listening. Two of the best tracks on Wonder Wonder are ones that display Frost's more strongly cultivated country influences. Brushed snare circles out a pattern in ""Easy to Love"" that could have easily been found in an Acuff/Rose C&W; standard, with a dulled piano break and cowboy harmonies completing the masquerade. And ""Further"" takes an old-time swing premise, adding a killer melody and violin solo. Frost's usually gentle vocals soar and dive between sweet and torchy. The vibe you get is that this song, out of all of them, was the most fun for her to record. The support personnel are above reproach. Steve Albini's engineering work is, quite simply, masterful. His hand/ear coordination is so keenly attuned to the low-key material that the songs and sounds seem almost to leap from the plastic. Rian Murphy, the producer of Frost's first album, returns once again to assemble a cast of musicians including Archer Prewitt, Poi Dog Pondering's Susan Vøelz and ex-Telegraph Melts cellist Amy Domingues. With this album, Frost moves beyond comparisons with others who may have a similar birthmark on their music or timbre to their voice, and should now be firmly entrenched as the benchmark for intelligent, eclectic, eccentric folk-pop. She can lull. She can pop. She can put on a retro croon. If I had any savage beast within me, I'm certain it would be soothed. Everyone else, come measure up, if you think you can.","Edith is quickly becoming my favorite Frost. Jack, who showed up for the first\n\ time in these parts last ...

Constantines,Constantines,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a651b1335d7bf1698dd7/1:1/w_160/1df31c3b.jpg,2001-10-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1590-constantines/,Three Gut,"""Young hearts be free tonight. Time is on your side."" The Constantines are quoting Rod Stewart's ""Young Turks"" on their own ""Young Offenders"". I love that Rod Stewart. He hasn't always made the greatest records, but he's always been a fun, friendly spirit, and what a great voice. Plus, he refused to age gracefully. From puberty on, we strip ourselves of any grace. We can either be subsumed by our awkwardness or we can revel in it, which is what rock and roll is really about-- a perpetual adolescence. What more powerful, sensitive, anguished and alive period of your life to perpetuate? And what more vibrant, muscular, raging-for-life music than rock and roll? Guelph, Ontario's The Constantines are constant teens, too. And when their music isn't capturing the goofy sweetness teenagers can share when they let their guard down, it captures the drama, anguish, artsy pretension and urgency of youth. They carry the torch for Fugazi with heart and muscle. Bassist Dallas Wehrle's pulsing eighth notes ground dynamic mathematical riffs, with the players dropping in and out to shock the repetitions. The Constantines climb closer to the Fugazic Throne on the strength of guitarist Steven Lambke's chops, the intelligent poetry of Bry Webb's lyrics, and the boozy rasps of both Webb and Lambke's vocals, which recall Let It Be-era Paul Westerberg. And like The Replacements, The Constantines dominate their movement with their personality, seeming wounded and aged (another teenage-less trick) before their time. ""We want the death of rock and roll,"" Webb announces on the opening track, ""Arizona"". It's a bleak and blocky number about the 1983 Arizona suicide of Danny Rapp, who wrote ""Rock 'n' Roll Is Here to Stay"". As the words come out, the music defies the message. The songs get better, looser, and more varied as the album progresses. ""Tonight we milk the stiffs,"" Webb announces on ""Some Party"". ""Storm the Bastille/ Raid the throne/ Mock the swine who'll rot in heaven/ Swinging on the velvet ropes/ Some punks getting some kicks at some party."" Nice lyrics. The Replacements influence shows up again on ""No Ecstasy"" which swings like the classic ""I Will Dare"". But it's ""Hyacinth Blues"" that really makes the bid for greatness. The guitars toll for thee as they stand silhouetted like an exorcist in the mist: ""Under Suspicion/ The fool's got the hyacinth..."" And here's one of the great pauses of rock and roll, giving meaning and heart to the topic at hand: ""...Blues."" Then, with anger and passion, they literally spell it out: ""O-V-E-R-D-O-S-E."" Another Westerbergian moment, ""St. You"", serves as the record's acoustic ballad, and no doubt the first of many in a long career. It's the part of the album that says, ""All this hard rocking is just something I do for a gas. I'm really a songwriter, and a damn fine one."" The also gentle but stronger ""Little Instruments"" closes the album on a determined note. They may not have the baddest axes, but as they state on the track, they've ""got an amplifier."" Indeed, they are amplifiers, as all overgrown teens are. They're emotional burn victims, holed up in their rooms, reading portentous comic books. Maybe they read Alan Moore's Swamp Thing and identify with the isolated, elemental monster. All teenagers are Swamp Things. They long for Alan Moore's other character, John Constantine, to come and tell them what they are, and that they and they alone can halt an apocalypse of the soul.

It doesn't roll off the tongue like Emerson, Lake and Palmer, now does it? Although I will concede that this bandname is slightly less cumbersome than Anderson-Bruford-Wakeman-Howe, it's fair to say that this record was not intended for discussion. Can you see asking someone, ""Have you heard the new one by Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge?"" Or, ""I like the Pixies, John Coltrane and Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge."" Fuck it. It just doesn't work. But I have to figure something out, because if asked about recent favorite records, my answer would include this thing by Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge. A bit of background on the players: David Kristian is an electronic musician fond of collaboration who explores the audibility threshold with his ambient works (see Room Tone) as well as dabbling in beat-driven techno. Sam Shalabi is a versatile musician who has lent his name to the near-East trance combo the Shalabi Effect, as well as playing on countless records in the Constellation/Godspeed/Alien8 axis. And Alexandre St-Onge plays upright bass with the Shalabi Effect, in addition to other gigs. All are based in Montreal, where they've performed together as a trio on occasion. While this record is improvised, the mood of each piece is so integrated and clearly defined it feels more like studied composition. St-Onge's upright bass provides the anchor with unsettling drones, scuffs and plucks. Kristian fills in dark colors on an analog synth, sometimes with gurgling modulation, and other times with quaking bass tones. Shalabi, meanwhile, provides much of the texture, picking and scraping his way on guitar and oud. It's an odd combination on paper, but the three work together as a single six-armed beast intent on conjuring black, brooding atmosphere. A discomforting sense of anxiety is established from the outset with ""Dirt Well."" Kristian lays down a warm drone, and over it, St-Onge bows a slow, creaking bass. When Shalabi adds delicate plucks on oud, the music becomes paradoxically both menacing and delicate, as the tiny, precise sounds far exceed the sum of their parts. The music occasionally threatens to burst into pure noise, but the crescendo (and attendant relief) never comes. This music is about the stalk and the hunt, not the kill, and the tension is impressively thick. The mood throughout is so consistent and relentless that some of the individual pieces are hard to differentiate. As Kristian's is the most sonically flexible instrument, the tracks that stand out most are those where he takes the lead. ""The Heart of a Mouse"" begins with some looped glitch-style friction, introduces other low level pops and hisses, and then becomes an increasingly quiet buzz that fades over the course of a minute or more. ""Insistent Falls"" finds Kristian piercing the silence with a high-pitched, grating synth drone piled on by guitar scrapes and bass moans. St-Onge take the lead on ""Little Feck,"" bowing higher in his instrument's range and imparting an eerie, speech-like quality that works perfectly next to the hypnotic hum. Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge is a demanding record-- one that requires a certain amount of work from the listener to be fully appreciated. The subtlety and quiet detail simply cannot be grasped without concentration. So no more talking; it is time now we listen.","Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge.

The Apology Wars,Blueline Medic,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a321b1335d7bf1698663/1:1/w_160/13eb6be1.gif,2001-10-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/823-the-apology-wars/,Fueled by Ramen,"Koalas and the boomerang. Paul Hogan and the Crocodile Hunter. Untold zillions of boisterous, brew-swilling, hostel-jumping backpackers. Oh, and, uh, 'roos, or whatever. You can add newcomers Blueline Medic to that hallowed list of exports from the island continent of Australia. With a name like Blueline Medic, you might be asking yourself how much your co-payment will be, but no, no, they're not an insurance company or even an HMO. In the great tradition of Aussie guitar noise, they're a capital R, capital B, Rock Band. Buzzsaw distortion, thoughtful lyrics, more power chords than you can reasonably be asked to deal with, and a vocalist that's equal parts J. Robbins, Bad Religion's Greg Graffin, and super-sensitivo and Hessian-last-named Blake Schwarzenbach are Blueline Medic's most salient features. Actually, the universal-sounding vocals are decent enough-- I'm not ripping on Donnie Dureau for having an unoriginal voice. In fact, it's the perfect voice for the band's sound. J. Robbins is not only a convenient reference point for describing Dureau's voice, but the affable and hook-conjuring mind behind Jawbox and Burning Airlines also manned the nobs and untangled patch chords on The Apology Wars. But unlike some of his other semi-recent production efforts (Promise Ring, Jets to Brazil), Blueline Medic's songs have enough teeth to showcase the man's production skills, and conversely, his able hands add contours to songs that might have otherwise sounded stale and quotidian. And now, friends, the track-by-track: Things get off on the wrong foot, unfortunately. ""Cathedral"" (Dureau's a big Raymond Carver fan) is lyrically engaging, but the melody-- especially for the all-important opening track-- sucks. The vocal phrases are too wordy, strung-together, and shapeless to redeem the punk-by-rote song. ""Ever the Lawn"" benefits from the contrast with its lackluster predecessor, and bubbles over with quirk, similar to much of the material off Burning Airline's debut, 1999's Mission: Control! ""Making the Nouveau Riche"" is a straight ahead, almost corny pop-punk song about leading an unconventional lifestyle, but more specifically, about being in a band. It works, getting by on sheer kinetic energy and memorably off-kilter lyrics: ""I'm without a zack/ A truth/ A coin, a kopeck or an elusive brass razoo."" ""At Least We Had the War"" is the fourth and finest track on the album. It's also guaranteed to make you do an auditory double take as you wonder how the fuck Morrissey took over your CD player; the intro and ending to the song are as good a Smiths imitation as there ever was. The meat of the song is murder-- sweeping, semi-epic pop with better-than-average melodies boasting smooth transitions between the tonally different Smiths-sounding sections and the main body. ""Not Interested"" is likewise heavily Smiths-informed in certain parts and smart-punk in others. The well-titled ""Shuffle and Scrape"" sounds like something off some Golden Era of Dischord release, very much in the spirit of Jawbox's seminal album, Novelty. ""Somnambulist"" displays Shaun Lohoar's simply tasteful drumming, while also incorporating decorative chiming sounds to great effect, one of the rare departures from standard instrumentation. ""Up Against the Fault,"" on the other hand, is simply a good example of the band's flair for the anthemic. There's nothing particularly mind-blowing about The Apology Wars, but the warmth and comfort of a new and eminently listenable rock band is noteworthy on its own. That the unimpeachably solid songs are also graced by thoughtful lyrics and underlined by obvious enthusiasm is reason to keep an eye on the Melbourne-based four-piece.","Koalas and the boomerang.

Hysteria,Kammerflimmer Kollektief,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb665e6ef95969322be0/1:1/w_160/fa2d5a34.gif,2001-10-07 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4381-hysteria/,Bubble CoreAfter Hours,"There must be something odd going on in the quiet little town of Weilheim, Germany. Home to the collective of labels known as Hausmusik, Payola and Kollaps, the number of groups from this area south of Munich has multiplied spectacularly in the past decade. To name only a few: The Notwist, Tied and Tickled Trio, Village of Savoonga, Fred is Dead, Couch, Console, and A Million Mercies. Some of these bands are better known than others, but each functions within the often incestuous Weilheim framework. Now we can add Thomas Weber's Kammerflimmer Kollektief (Shimmering Collective) to that list. Begun in the late 90s as an electro-acoustic one-man project incorporating electronic sound constructions into both the rock and jazz idioms, Weber initially released two limited-run 12"" singles for the Weilheim-based Payola label in 1998 (both of which were collected on their debut full-length, Mäander, last year). Approximating the free jazz of the late 60's (John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Peter Brötzmann as reference points) and blending it with traditional rock structures, Kammerflimmer astounded, and marked new territory for the German scene. Tracks like ""Implodiert"" and ""Nachtwach"" were rhythmically explosive; anchored by Weber's bass and working around a slow-building hiss of electronics, they would eventually careen into a climax of ear-splitting dissonance and static. With those releases and subsequent works-- an incredible remix of Tied and Tickled Trio's ""Constant"" and the strictly jazz Incommunicado, which is just seeing U.S. release this month through Temporary Residence-- Weber carved his own niche within the minds of a select few record aficionados around the globe. With this, the Kollektief's third release in a year, the sense of surging immediacy so prevalent on the initial releases has been abandoned in favor of subtlety and suggestive soundscapes. Weber expanded the collective to a six-piece with the jazz workout of Incommunicado, and that lineup sticks around for Hysteria as well. Clocking in at barely over thirty minutes, the newest release plays more like an EP. Reserving three of the six tracks for his solo sonic experiments, Weber plays along with the other members on three group songs. After just one listen, it becomes quickly apparent that Weber functions much better on his own than within the group context. Kammerflimmer begins the album in a haze with the title track. Built around his electronic treatments and the plucked strings of an upright bass, the lead track buzzes with Weber's signature sound-- a high-pitched burst of static noise that weaves in and out of the background. Weber's ability to take inorganic sound treatments and effortlessly blend them with traditional instrumentation has been one of the most captivating elements of the music he produces. At times reminiscent of Scenic's Acquatica, the standout track (""Engel Wacht"") is Weber working solo again. Pulling together the sound of wind chimes, distant percussion, and (surprise!) sudden but effective bursts of static, Weber constructs a beautiful track built around mournful guitar playing. ""Seen (Not Seen)"" follows the title track and, with it comes the full band's first attempt at exhibiting their skills (or lack thereof). With very few of Weber's treatments, the track is contingent upon the unit's ability to coalesce into a whole. Comprised of alto and baritone saxes, guitar, bass, analog synth and percussion along with Weber's sound collages, Hysteria's musical landscape should be comparable to what Weber was doing all by his lonesome three years ago. Regrettably, on their new release, Weber's acoustic jazz ensemble rarely achieves anything more than aimless meandering. The near exception is ""Mohn!"" (loose translation: ""poppy""), the album's closing track, and the one in which the group finally proves they might actually be able to bring it all together into something more than just the sum of their individual parts. Evocative of urban nightscapes, the track is similar to ""Engel Wacht"" but doesn't work nearly as well. Bassist Johannes Frisch lays the groundwork for the other musicians, but no other player ever steps forward to lead, including Weber. Clocking in at nearly six minutes, the track finally gets exciting with about 20 seconds left when Weber's electronically manipulated guitar enters the picture. And then, as abruptly as the excitement began, it ends. On Hysteria, it feels like Kammerflimmer Kollektief never really get off the ground. There's a stark contrast between the tracks on which Weber plays exclusively and those on which the group plays. The decision to divide the tracks equally between the two only exaggerates the differences. Much of Weber's solo tracks are satisfying, but the group's work feels like sonic doodling, never really quite hitting the mark. The finest moments, bleak and desolate, stand at odds with Weber's prior recorded output. Much of the stuff on Mäander brimmed with energy and playfulness (sheets of static fuzz thrown in with rhythmic, percussive explosions and fractured saxophone squawks), something desperately needed on Hysteria. Tied and Tickled Trio keyboardist Andreas Gerth once said, ""It's true that all the music coming from [Weilheim] seems touched by a certain melancholia."" Up until now I could've disagreed based solely on Kammerflimmer Kollektief's catalog, but now even Thomas Weber exhibits a tinge of that autumnal feel. Unfortunately, the melancholy that's worked so well for others in the Weilheim musical landscape renders the Shimmering Collective motionless and uninspired.","There must be something odd going on in the quiet little town of Weilheim,\n\ Germany.

Nut Music: As Free as the Squirrels,Starship Beer,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a553ea9e61561daa50f0/1:1/w_160/a381a7c4.gif,2001-10-07 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7482-nut-music-as-free-as-the-squirrels/,AtavisticUnheard Music SeriesAtavisticUnheard Music Series,"When I first heard about Starship Beer's Nut Music: As Free as the Squirrels, I was lost in reverie. I had a little fantasy, a daydream if you will: It's late on a Thursday night in 1984. Los Angeles. Grace Slick, Mickey Thomas and the gang are holding a band meeting. You see, founding member Paul Kanter has just flown the coup, and the boys (and girl) of Jefferson Starship are in the midst of an identity crisis. After much heated debate (mostly surrounding the whereabouts of the requisite band meeting cocaine supply), they decide to get back to their roots-- which involves foregoing the nose candy in favor of large quantities of weed, hallucinogens, and beer. So, the ol' hooka is dusted off, an RCA label lackey goes out back to pick some shrooms from the garden, and bassist Pete Sears whips out his old pal Lucky the Psychedelic Toad from the codpiece of his buckskin trousers. Before long, things start getting pretty ""cosmic"" and the band decides to strap on their gear and see what happens. And it's all good and mellow until Lucky decides to take a swim in Grace's beer mug, unbeknownst to her. Bad vibes commence. ""Paul!!! Paul, where are you?!?,"" Grace howls in her operatic tenor. ""I'm cruising through the universe on Starship Beer! I'm knee deep in the hoopla! I'm cruising the universe in Starship Beer, knee deep in the hoopla!"" Meanwhile, the whole band starts freaking out. Drummer Danny Baldwin starts hitting everything in sight, whether it's part of his kit or not, and everyone else pretty much ditches their main instruments for piano, recorders, clarinets, and organ. Somebody even finds a shortwave radio and starts screwing with it. Suddenly, the spirit of Albert Ayler enters the room to conduct the whole mad orchestra. A week passes before the next band meeting. This time, things go more smoothly. The cocaine supply has been replenished, and they all have a good laugh at what happened the week before. ""That silly Grace, what a card,"" they say. As an in-joke they decide to name their next album Knee Deep in the Hoopla: Grace's bad trip will be a symbol of their rebirth. What's more, they decide to change the band's name from Jefferson Starship to Starship Beer to cement their commitment to their bold new musical direction. But after a ""reality check"" with label execs, the whole plan is scrapped. It's decided that the bandname will simply be shortened to Starship so as not to confuse people. They're allowed to keep the album title, as it has a certain schmaltzy, vaguely blue-collar ring to it that will appeal to a broad range of everyday working class joes. But instead of avant-skronk freakout, the band goes with plan b, spewing forth ""We Built this City"" and ""Sara."" The good news is that some far-sighted studio intern had the smarts to roll tape during the Starship Beer sessions, and now we can all bear witness to this anomalous wrinkle in musical history. Unfortunately, none of this is true. Well, except for the description of the music. In reality, Starship Beer first took flight (forgive me) in the early 70s though most of the material on Nut Music: As Free as the Squirrels was recorded and released in limited quantities in late 1979. The band is comprised of a core trio of Wes Mingin, Pat O'Brien, and Kevin Whitehead, the latter eventually becoming a jazz critic for NPR's Fresh Air. They banded together while students at upstate New York's Oswego State, and have performed off and on ever since. This reissue, dug up as part of Atavistic's Unheard Music Series, contains four bonus tracks-- two from the 70s, two from the 80s-- making it a must for the Starship Beer completist in your family. On the lead-off track, ""Black/White White/Black,"" the band tests the limits of listenability with a jive-poetry rant that owes more than a little to Captain Beefheart: ""I got black pants/ I got black shoes/ I got white shirt/ I got white sunglasses.../ And when I walk out the door, my eyes begin to fall like rain."" The rest of the song is made up of variations on these bare statements, while a bass and an electric guitar chase each other around. The next hour or so is all over the place: solo piano meanderings, extemporaneous verse, honking clarinets, feedback assault, all apparently improvised. It all pretty much falls into the category Lester Bangs termed ""horrible noise,"" meaning it's pretty good if you're like me and are into this kinda nonsense. Still, I guarantee that you'll listen to this no more than twice: once for your own enlightenment, and once again when someone sees it in your collection and says, ""What the hell is Starship Beer?"" At which point you have my permission to tell them a little story about Grace Slick and company.","When I first heard about Starship Beer's Nut Music: As Free as the Squirrels, I was lost in reverie ...

Poses,Rufus Wainwright,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b79d034d5c69bf3cd5/1:1/w_160/f3b695d5.gif,2001-10-07 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8557-poses/,Dreamworks,"Rufus Wainwright has quite the life. After he cut his first demo with producer Pierre Marchand, his father, Canadian folk giant Loudon Wainwright III, passed it on to legendary arranger Van Dyke Parks, who in turn saw that it found its way to Dreamworks executive Lenny Waronker. With a simple glance at the Dreamworks logo on the back of Poses, I trust you can connect the dots for yourself. If only it could be that easy for everyone, right? Oh, wait. I guess I forgot to mention that Rufus Wainwright deserves it. On his 1998 self-titled debut, Wainwright managed to pull together myriad strands and meld them into a grand, cohesive vision. And now, with Poses, he takes that vision and refines it, resulting in an epic album that speaks with grand gestures and a refined eloquence rare in young songwriters. Of course, it never hurts to have a killer cast of collaborators to help you achieve your vision, and Wainwright has certainly assembled one for this record. Drummer Jim Keltner (Elvis Costello, Ry Cooder) returns on the traps, trading off spots with Victor Indrizzo (Chris Cornell, Redd Kross). Paul Weller cohort Pete Wilson mans the bass, and Dennis Farias (Burt Bacharach) provides colorful trumpet accents. Propellerhead Alex Gifford, Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, Robyn Hitchcock), and Damian LeGassick (Blur) combine for production that veers effortlessly from the dark strings of ""Evil Angel"" to the beat-infused ""Tower of Learning,"" and widely across a lot of terrain in between. Poses opens and closes with the Tin Pan Alley tribute ""Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,"" recalling some of the Divine Comedy's more playful moments with its ode to subtle addictions and the way our compulsions rule our lives (""If I should buy jellybeans/ I have to eat them all in just one sitting""). In between, we get everything from a Ouija board session with the ghost of Jeff Buckley (""The Consort"") to the faithful and endearing cover of Loudon's classic ""One Man Guy"" that proves Rufus has at least a touch of dad's folk roots in him. The album's title track stands as one of Wainwright's finest songs, with an aching melody and Spartan piano backing. It also illustrates how far his voice has come since his debut. He's become far more expressive in the last few years and his voice is a bit less of an acquired taste than it used to be. The funky ""Shadows"" is coated in thickly layered vocal harmonies that betray a definite debt to vocal jazz, though the swelling strings might sound a little more at home on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Still, it's pretty fantastic stuff, and Rufus takes pains to breathe life into his Frankensteins, never letting them degenerate into limp genre exercises. ""Tower of Learning"" is more impressive still, opening wide up in the second verse over programmed beats in an arrangement that looms over the rest of the album. Barring the reprise of ""Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,"" Poses is closed on a somber note with the beautifully simple ""In a Graveyard,"" a soulful reflection on moribund themes that momentarily leaves the oboes and strings at the door for a direct heart-to-heart with the listener. It's always refreshing to see a recording this singular find its way out the door of a major label, and it's heartening to know that Wainwright probably has a secure home at Dreamworks. With Poses, he proves that he's swinging for the big leagues, and that he has every right to be there.","Rufus Wainwright has quite the life.

Onanie Bomb Meets Sex Pistols (which contained their first two Japanese releases) hit American shores in 1989; some were shocked at the level of idiocy and destructive tendencies in the music, while others just looked at song titles like ""Anal Eater"" and ""Lick 'm Cock Boatpeople"" and turned the other cheeks. Of course, most people didn't notice, and it's something of a shame because the world hadn't seen such a good No Wave act since Suicide's Martin Rev spit on his first fan. The band responded to their nay-sayers by acting as if nothing ever happened, and in turn attracted such Yankee luminaries as John Zorn and Thurston Moore. For some reason, the band seemed to appeal more to the experimental audience than any others, and when it came time to book the second stage at the second Lollapalooza, Boredoms got their first real American props. It was good timing, as Warner Brothers was releasing the band's third album, 1993's Pop Tatari, which Spin called the most non-commercial album ever released by a major label. I suppose the band trusted Spin about as much as I do, because their next album, 1994's Chocolate Synthesizer, was even more of a slap in the face to anyone who ever struggled to get signed to a major than Tatari was. It seemed that there was no end to their persistent, uncommonly devastative music. Then, there was an end. In 1993, the band had recorded a seemingly one-off EP entitled Super Roots. Its music, and that of the limited edition follow-up, 1994's Super Roots 2, were basically extensions of their by-then familiar avant-punk. But just after Synthesizer, they released part three in the series, which consisted of but one tune, 33 minutes in length. The track was really just a hardcore punk song, but it stretched out over the length of a sitcom, and without any breaks, save a two-minute moment of silence at the end. It was an interesting idea, and one they built upon with Super Roots 5, extending the tune to 65 minutes. Of course, the sheer monolithic nature of playing punk for half an hour didn't win many new fans. The most obvious change in Boredoms' philosophy came from around 1996, when they released Super Roots 6. Unlike anything they had ever done, it featured low key, mostly instrumental tunes influenced more by Can and Neu than hardcore punk. Additionally, unlike all but the first in this series, it was released in America, which meant that anyone with a Blockbuster on their corner and $12 could get in on the ground floor of Boredoms, mark II. Before most folks had time to digest the new direction (and to be fair, Boredoms are still more than a little obscure), the band changed sounds again. Super Roots 7 was released in Japan in 1998, and expanded the band's arsenal to include the blissfully psychedelic and all that is trippy. It wasn't trance, but it could bring you to the same place, and it was certainly more inviting than anything they'd ever released before. Soon after, they released the acclaimed Super Ae, and have since been stuck in a rather wonderful looping system of sun worship and general repentance for all the damage they'd done the previous 15 years. Vision Creation Newsun came out in Japan in late '99, and was released in America the following year. For anyone unaware, it was something of a refinement of the hard trance Boredoms explored on Super Roots 7 and Ae, taken to its seemingly logical conclusion. Yamatsuka Eye, possessing an affinity for underground DJ culture, had some of the Boredoms' stuff remixed by various big names (including U.N.K.L.E. and DJ Krush), but apparently wanted to try his hand at the game himself. Rebore Vol. 0 is Eye's remix of Vision Creation Newsun, and helps make the case that Boredoms are one of the great bands of the rock era. The track titles are as follows: ""7,"" ""77,"" ""777,"" ""7777,"" ""77777,"" ""777777,"" and ""7777777."" For clarity (or because I can't process more than four numbers at a time), I won't reference songs by name. This should be okay, as the spirit of the record, similar to recent efforts, lies in the whole as opposed to the individual. It follows the track order from Vision Creation Newsun, so anyone familiar with that album should be fine-- not that chronology has ever been a major player in Boredoms' music. The album begins with something of a fanfare, but there are certainly no trumpets to announce the arrival of this ship. Something like looped war cries (it sounds like drummer Yoshimi, but you never know) resonate over whirlpool reverb and the future shock of congas spliced with dial tone hum. Phased guitars and maraca treatises come in and out of the mix, but over its almost nine-minute duration, the overwhelming feeling is of takeoff-- like a rocket without a rudder, and the final frontier nothing but a prologue. Once airborne, we're offered any number of puffy, articulate hors d'oeuvres, courtesy of Seiichi Yamamoto's guitar and subtle synth. Eye's remix tends to favor what seemed superficial on Newsun. Most of the pounding percussion has been removed and remodeled to suit the aims of the new breed: reverb, flange, delay, the cut and pasted-- in short, the electronic and altered rather than anything natural. This may be my only complaint with the album; chiefly that while I always enjoy a good trip over the moon, a little earthbound warmth might have been nice. Elsewhere, we have intrusive drum machines making waste of whatever seams had been left untouched. In another corner is acoustic guitar and light cymbal, left to dry in the sun as if Pro Tools had never happened. I thought I heard an uttering baby in there somewhere, but I'm sure Eye wouldn't subject an infant to this kind trip, lest it come back older than Einstein. Despite the fact that the tracks here are broken up (unlike Newsun's continuous program), the arc of the journey is intact, and anyone who gives an album like this half a chance will probably come out slightly changed. Rebore Vol. 0 (subtitled Vision Recreation) ends similarly to how it began, with blaring rocket engines and vacuum echo. Of course, the journey back down is invariably more comfortable, if only because you know you're back home again. (Most people probably weren't meant for extended periods in outer space.) Practically speaking, I would recommend this album (despite its hefty import price tag) with the caveat that if you aren't a Boredoms freak, or at least interested in their recent stuff, you might want to start with one of the proper releases. However, there's a part of me that wants to throw this upon unsuspecting masses, to people who aren't normally accustomed to long bouts with insanity. It's beautiful in its way, but for me, it's more of an exploratory thing. Boredoms have come a long way over the years, and that they often push forward at the expense of public acceptance or even familiarity might be reason enough to coast alongside for as long as you're able.","It wasn't like this last time.

Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks EP,Modest Mouse,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c376c0084474cd0c349a/1:1/w_160/c1bfa3f5.gif,2001-10-04 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5360-everywhere-and-his-nasty-parlour-tricks-ep/,Epic,"There's a very fine line between insight and cliché. It's common logic that the things that get said the most seem to ring the most true. But when you've heard them enough, they simply fail to resonate. Sometimes, it takes someone who seems more than a little bit fucked up to see past the countless clichés of rock music and come through with something distinctive and original. Isaac Brock has always possessed a twisted and brilliant type of insight, both in his lyrics and in the way he presents them. Take ""Dramamine,"" the very first song off of Modest Mouse's very first full-length. With that song, Brock penned one of the most memorable, oddly insightful lyrics of all time: ""We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves."" Sung in a whiny nasal voice over acoustic guitar strumming, the lyric would have been nothing short of painful. But Brock blurts it out with helpless but violent disgust, and somehow, it seems more like a spontaneous thought than like a line some hipster poet wrote in his lyrics journal. Modest Mouse, in their beginnings, were largely preoccupied with the perception of motion and isolation. Especially with This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About, and the early singles that would later become Building Nothing out of Something, the band managed to accomplish what is perhaps one of the most sanctified goals of the musician: to provide a sonic analog for visual and kinetic sensations. Last year, on their third proper album, the band seriously altered what sensations they were trying to approximate, focusing less on the thoughts one might have while sitting in the backseat of a poorly air-conditioned sedan, and more on thoughts of death and the nature of the universe. Thankfully, the scope of their sound expanded in kind, resulting in the sweeping, gorgeous The Moon and Antarctica. Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks, which consists of the four tracks from the Night on the Sun 12"" and four additional tracks, would have been a perfectly logical precursor to The Moon and Antarctica. Part dreamy existential reflection and part steady, chugging highway soundtrack, the eight songs on this EP capture bits and pieces of all eras of Modest Mouse's sound, without ever quite achieving the coherency of any of them. Four of the tracks on Everywhere have already been reviewed by Pitchfork, but it seems appropriate now to just reiterate how excellent some of them are. ""Night on the Sun"" and ""You're the Good Things"" (originally released on Night on the Sun) are the two great tracks this disc has to offer. The former stands right up there with any of the band's best album cuts, managing to be both catchy and immensely disconcerting. Lyrically bizarre and alternatingly sparse and dense, musically, ""Night on the Sun"" encapsulates the best of early and late Modest Mouse. ""You're the Good Things"" uses the classic Modest Mouse formula of gradually getting more intense and primal as the song progresses, to great effect. ""Willful Suspension of Disbelief,"" the weakest of the three non-album Night on the Sun tracks, seems just a bit too comfortable sticking to its one-chord shuffle. Spooky, reverb-soaked guitars draw streaks of spooky discordance through an already otherworldly mix. But the song itself still suffers from a lack of change. And then there are the new tracks. A snippet of ""3 Inch Horses, Two-Faced Monsters"" appears at the end of ""A Different City"" on The Moon and Antarctica, and on Everywhere, we finally get to experience the song in its full fiddle-toting glory. With a little help from Califone's Tim Rutilli, ""3 Inch Horses, Two Faced Monsters"" is probably the closest thing to back-country folk music Modest Mouse has ever recorded. With Brian Deck at the mixer, though, it winds up sounding like back-country folk from beyond the grave. Sadly, ""3 Inch Horses"" is really just the same thing repeating itself over and over again, and unquestionably outstays its welcome at over four minutes. ""So Much Beauty in Dirt,"" and its more stripped-down counterpart, ""Here It Comes,"" both suffer from being insanely repetitive without benefiting from the kind of subtle song development that we've come to expect from Modest Mouse. As if that weren't enough, the former also suffers from being almost tragically awkward. But then there's ""The Air,"" an odd four-plus minute instrumental that basically serves to show off the fact that, hey, Brian Deck is a really fucking good producer. The song samples instrumentation and effects from the Moon and Antarctica sessions and reassembles them into a strange, ethereal series of triggered loops and spacious hums that somehow sounds more organic than electronic. And of course, ""I Came as a Rat"" makes another gratuitous appearance here, just as it did on Night on the Sun. Given that ""I Came as Rat"" appears in identical form to the Moon and Antarctica version, and that the two best songs on this EP were already released on an earlier 12"", it's hard to fully embrace Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks. (Don't even get me started on the title.) If you didn't get a chance to pick up Night on the Sun, or if you're a hardcore vinyl-hater, Everywhere is worth it simply for its two best tracks. Otherwise, be advised that Everywhere essentially plays out as throwaways from The Moon and Antarctica.","There's a very fine line between insight and clich\xE9.

Imperial Metric,Appliance,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e79d034d5c69bf2825/1:1/w_160/5a1a8b83.gif,2001-10-04 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/265-imperial-metric/,Mute,"Imperial Metric proves that I shouldn't give up on anyone. Appliance's previous releases, Manual and Six Modular Pieces, got on my nerves with their blatant conformance to the post-rock blueprint: two parts early Stereolab, two parts Sonic Youth, two parts Tubeway Army-by-way-of-Trans Am, and a dash of Plone/Broadcast bitters. It sounded like a style-mag committee drummed up the concepts, and negotiated to do away with the band's energy to make room for blank posturing. Thankfully, with Imperial Metric, Appliance have redeemed themselves, an album that, while stylish, never seemed coutured. The band have created a fascinating blend of post-punk dub, primitive electronics, and Soviet-menace nostalgia. It could have been so hokey! But Appliance keep a straight face throughout and their expressionist devices overdriving throughout. Beginning with a concrète squiggle, ""Separate Animals"" soon finds its solid squelch groove, as vocalist/guitarist James Brooks growls, ""You live on the left/ Your mind is on the right/ The city's full of people/ You're speaking to the speaker."" While Brooks develops this bipolar theme, the rest of the band sets the synths to gloomily pound and squirm. If they weren't so serious about it, you could call it camp. A muted trumpet delivers a twisted reveille call at the opening of ""Map of the Territory,"" and a Jason Pierce-emulating Brooks delivers a darkly blessed warning that ""silence has left a hole wider than a mile."" Amidst all these mechanical prophecies, Brooks plucks away at a crippled guitar figure tormented by trumpet. ""F.L.F. (Precious Bodily Fluids)"" is an altogether more peaceful affair, which could be nicely reworked for the glitch-tech crowds that bug out to Herbert's Bodily Functions. ""Land, Sea and Air"" rocks back and forth on muscled heels. Here, Brooks' guitar recalls Bunnymen guitarist Will Sergeant in his vintage Crocodiles era-- though blips and burps attempt to bury him, Brooks is unwavering in his commitment. The instrumental ""Comrades (in a Moscow Hotel)"" is ironically calming by comparison. But beneath the pads and aloof percussion, there lurks a John LeCarré paranoia. Appliance lose their footing with ""H2O."" The track which opens with the same rushing glisten that haunted Björk's ""Hunter,"" but collapses when Brooks sings about the ""H2O in his mouth running low"" and ""on his skin, running dry, running thin."" Drummer Dave Ireland gamely tries to distract us from the overwrought lyrics by thumping the daylight out of his kit in a passable homage to Death in Vegas' ""Aisha."" Unfortunately, the serial murdering character Iggy Pop portrayed on that track wasn't around to round off the effect. While the instrumental ""Skylight"" sounds like an Air remix of Public Image Ltd's ""Careering,"" ""AM/PM"" gives bassist Stuart Christie an opportunity to showcase his Peter Hook-like talent as various analog effects thread around him and Berlin-period Bowie synth washes settle a polluting pall over Brooks' dejected vocals (""Well, I'm falling down/ I couldn't try/ You and me/ It's a fine line""). ""Navigating the Nursery Slope"" is Electricity-era OMD propelled by Neu!'s signature motorik rhythm. After the Spacemen 3-style narco-lullaby of ""A Gentle Cycle Revolution"" and the Augustus Pablo-meets-New Order sound of ""Navigating the Nursery Slopes,"" the album settles into slumberous quiescence with ""Where Has the Space Race Gone?,"" the epitome of Cold War nostalgia. Here, Appliance reference every theme they've developed over the course of Imperial Metric in an eight minute instrumental recalling the second side of Bowie's Low. That icy bliss stills the album at its close, and we leave Appliance certain that they've escaped the foul-ups of their past. By saturating themselves in the stealth-and-bunker, spy-counter-spy politics of the mid-to-late twentieth century, and the skeletal electronics of that wary era, Appliance consummately fulfill their potential.","Imperial Metric proves that I shouldn't give up on anyone.

Ones and Zeroes,IfiHadAHiFi,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1af13d197565213bc39/1:1/w_160/725c9659.gif,2001-10-04 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4066-ones-and-zeroes/,No Karma,"The members of IfiHadAHiFi go by the names Noise Lesion, Dr. Awkward, Mr. Alarm, and Yale Delay. Let the record show, they're crazy for palindromes. It's odd that they revere such a balanced form of wordplay, though-- their sound sprawls in all directions, a cacophony that attempts to dance. Let me throw out some band combinations: Bis and Trans Am. Robert Smith and the Happy Mondays. Grandaddy, Sonic Youth, and the B-52's. Brilliance, mess and mud. But what IfiHadAHiFi sounds most like is a louder, bitchier Clinic. They're not as good, and they're sloppier, but they muster the same excitement. ""The All Tied Up,"" Ones and Zeroes' opening track, begins with a particularly Clinical feel, with its drumrolls and muted synthesizers, and a guitar that introduces a clanking funk. But this band is both more conventional and more all-over-the-place. While Clinic gives the impression that anything can happen, IfiHadAHiFi's aesthetic announces that everything will happen, all the time. Almost martial call-and-response chants and whoops are buried under perpetually spinning synth squiggles, raucous guitars and rock/funk rhythms. The sound buzzes with layers, with the layers sometimes losing out to the buzz as the recording process is overwhelmed. ""The All Tied Up"" flows directly into ""(This is) The New Science,"" one of the cleanest tracks, and the one that should be the model for what the band does henceforth. A synth whirls by like a fan flying off its axle, its blades made of singing swords. A succession of chants and the ubiquitous ""woo-hoo's"" build to the title refrain. Chaos slowly dominates as the band sings assertive ba-babba-labba's until a wash of noise overtakes them. The third track is the first mistake. All the layers and chaos are pushed down under a kitschy cliché: an old announcer's voice describing rudimentary dance technique. It's an awful choice-- one that similarly mars ""Tanguska-Electro,"" a tune about the great inventor Tesla's attempt to create a death ray. Singing about a death ray is sufficient; having some cornball announcer tell us what the song we can no longer hear is about is egregiously wrong. It's the kind of move that makes me less forgiving of the muddiness. (In the album credits, mixing is listed as by ""consensus,"" either a bad technician with a bad showbiz name, or more likely, a horrible way to mix an album. ""Make my part louder!"") ""One Happy Pussycat"" plays its vocals, if not everything else, at a slower speed, with not much else to balance the track. ""I just want to love you, baby,"" the singer croaks. It sounds like the creepy voice at the end of The Virgin Suicides soundtrack getting delusions of Barry White, or like failing batteries on a walkman. But for all its mistakes, the whirling madness of most of these songs is undeniable. This is the other IDM: Insane Dance Music. Instead of shaking it to processed slices of digital glory, people should be staggering around in confusion, their minds disabled by the very live sound this band makes. Still, if the band could clean up their sound a little and avoid the overdubbed announcer guys, they could stand to be an important band. Or at least a lot of fun.","The members of IfiHadAHiFi go by the names Noise Lesion, Dr. Awkward, Mr. Alarm,\n\ and Yale Delay. Let the ...

"The Man Felt an Iron Hand Grab Him by the Hair, at the Nape. Not One Hand, a Hundred Hands Seized Him, Each by the Hair, and Tore Him Head to Foot, the Way You Tear Up a Sheet of Paper, into Hundreds of Little Pieces",Lumen,by: Brent S.

Literate but cumbersome album title? Check. Serpentine and repetitive instrumentals? Check. Clinical substitution of Roman numerals for song titles? Check. Cred to burn, gleaned largely from band members' obscure but locally heroic previous outfits? Check. The symptoms leave little room for interpretation. All signs point to post-rock. You've probably heard this one: three guys encounter a steaming pile of shit in the middle of the sidewalk and stop dead in their tracks. One says, ""Hmm. Do you think that's shit?"" First guy bends over a takes a whiff: ""Smells like shit,"" he says. Second guy pokes at it a few times before mashing his palm in the pile: ""Sure feels like shit,"" he decides. Third guy takes a pinch of it to his tongue: ""Man, this tastes like shit! Guys, I think this is definitely shit!"" First one says, ""Whoa, it's a good thing we didn't step in it."" Upon first encountering it, Lumen's The Man Felt an Iron Hand smells, feels and tastes just like a steaming pile of post-rock. But I stepped in it anyway. Fionic as it sounds, Lumen's lengthy (and elegantly violent) album title is actually cribbed straight from a short story by one of the twentieth century's most inventive fabulists, the late Italo Calvino-- ""The Mine Fields,"" from Difficult Loves. Superfluous, perhaps, but at least it isn't some cocktail napkin dreck. And Lumen does indeed feature members of two noted San Francisco post-rock combos, A Minor Forest and Tarantel. And they have indeed foregone track titles for their complex and warmly engaging debut. But looks and smells can be deceiving. Something about The Man Felt an Iron Hand evades the harmless academics that have come to serve as the signature of the post-rock non-genre. Something like prog. The Man Felt an Iron Hand is largely acoustic, dominated by guitars and accordions; keyboards color the spaces between, while the drumming is absolutely berserk. The guitars on ""I"" owe more to the ecstatic meandering of John Fahey than the dour meditations of Aerial M-- reckless, exotic and free. The fat organs pulse and splash with an almost psych-bluesy swagger. Beneath them, the percussion seems possessed: rocking frenetically between John Bonham and Rasheed Ali. The music sounds like a skeletal prog-rock: wooden and spare, but no less grand. ""II"" manages to conjure the loping medievalism that has become the butt of all Canterbury prog jokes. But for all the churchy organs and lute-like guitars, there isn't an ounce of wank to be had. Perhaps it's the fierce drums that manage to keep the edge on Lumen razor sharp; on paper it reads like a lull, but somehow the music always manages to shred a bit like the man in the title. Yet ""VII"" succeeds without any percussion at all; it pits the minimal guitars against each other to drone and drift like layers of a Reich piece, alternately dissonant and complimentary. Somehow, Lumen makes experimentation sound sweet and almost comforting. So pick it up and eat it. The Man Felt an Iron Hand isn't what you think it is. Yes, it's dressed like post-rock, but its soul is prog and its balls are metal. For a moment you're surprised that it's not content to serve as sonic wallpaper. Where do these guys get off? There's an ambition and aggression to Lumen that so much contemporary instrumental rock has lost. Besides, Jim O'Rourke's nowhere to be found on it. And you're tracking it all over the carpet.","Let's see. Literate but cumbersome album title? Check. Serpentine and repetitive instrumentals? Check. Clinical substitution of Roman numerals for ...

Better Than the Beatles: A Tribute to the Shaggs,Various Artists,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b29d034d5c69bf2eb2/1:1/w_160/43d612b4.gif,2001-10-03 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7087-better-than-the-beatles-a-tribute-to-the-shaggs/,Animal World,"Everyone from Led Zeppelin to Jandek has one, so why not the Shaggs? Why not? I imagine that must have been the response from most of the involved parties when asked to contribute to Better Than the Beatles: A Tribute to the Shaggs. Why not? I've never been a fan of tribute albums. They just seem gratuitous, and a way for bands (and labels) to gain notoriety through association-- a shortcut bypassing actual work. They're the equivalent of album filler in any CD collection, ranking just above soundtrack compilations in my book (hello, Batman Forever). But having heard of the Shaggs years ago, and actually hearing their music years later, I asked myself the same question: why not? After all, it's got an interesting line-up of off-kilter artists (Thinking Fellers, Danielson Famile, Optiganally Yours, etc.), and it's not like any of them are going to commit a sacrilegious travesty by ruining an original, or bore you to death with simple mimicry. Both would be nearly impossible.. But what kind of world do we live in where a trio of musically disinclined sisters from rural New Hampshire-- driven to practice and perform by a superstitious, and perhaps tyrannical, father who believed his mother foretold the group-- can cut an album full of what can only be called ""attempted"" pop songs, and thirty years later be subject of an honorary tribute? The answer: a strange and beautiful one, friends. And if that sounds naïvely optimistic, so be it. It comes from listening to the Shaggs' naïve stabs at musicianship. All the same, it's not an uncommon reaction to think a joke is being played on you when you listen to the Shaggs-- that's part of the appeal. ""Who do these people think they are? What was going through their heads when they recorded this?"" Trying to answer these questions is half the fun. Then there's the fact that the Shaggs seem to have single-handedly (though unwittingly) laid the groundwork for the faux-naivete of twee-pop and possibly K Records itself. And then there's the proclamation by legendary wise-ass Frank Zappa that the Shaggs were better than the Beatles, a statement so confounding of popular logic that it just adds more confusion and mystery to the mix. Although hated by many (and ignored by many more), few people argue that the Shaggs possessed no personality or spirit. The question is, did they have something else? Is there any merit to their songwriting? If so, it should shine through in the hands of able musicians, right? Well, right, but very unexpectedly, the problem here isn't with the material, it's with the ""able musicians."" Most of the participants choose to tip-toe around the songs, rarely cutting loose or experimenting, possibly for fear of accusations of trying to out-Shagg the Shaggs. True to tribute album custom, the Big Guns are put up front, as Ida starts the album off with ""Philosophy of the World,"" the title track of the lone proper Shaggs album. The upbeat, ska-like rhythm of the original is traded in for what sounds like a Scottish dirge, proving Ida can sap the energy out of almost anything. Optiganally Yours is next with a slightly more interesting, but similarly drab ""You're Something Special to Me."" Of all the bands on this record, I had the biggest hopes for Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 and their version of ""Who are Parents,"" but they too take the catatonic route, risking little and turning in another disappointment. Mongrel breaks up the monotony with a somber but spirited rendition of ""My Cutie,"" finally busting out an acoustic guitar in favor of organ. Bauer's ""We have a Savior"" returns to the keyboard (it's as though there's a timidity toward approaching the guitarwork of front-Shagg Dot Wiggin), but the inner creepiness comes through here, as well as on Joost Visser's Will Oldham-like treatment of ""It's Halloween."" Deerhoof takes on the quintessential Shaggs' song, ""My Pal Foot Foot."" Building on bouncy sound effects, they come away with the best song on the album. R. Stevie Moore & the Olsiewics-Chusid Ensemble, followed by Plastic Mastery, cling close to the originals of ""My Companion"" and ""Shaggs' Own Thing"" respectfully, while the Slot Racers do a folky medley of ""Painful Memories"" and ""Wheels."" Next up, the Danielson Famile take their shot at ""Who are Parents,"" and come away with hilarious results, complete with lisping baby-talk vocals which erase the album's early disappointments. Later, the Furtips' ""You're Something Special to Me"" recalls the Modern Lovers, and the Double U finish things off with a more playful version of the opening song. Like most tribute albums, Better than the Beatles succeeds less as a cohesive statement than as way of piquing interest in lesser known artists. But wait a minute, didn't I come out against that kind of thing near the beginning of this review?","Everyone from Led Zeppelin to Jandek has one, so why not the Shaggs? Why not?

Uh, make it, uh... one. One, two, one, two, three..."" -- Brian Wilson, 1966, during the recording of Smile This is always how it ends up for perfectionist geniuses. While modern day recording techniques have cleaned up a lot of the extraneous human element, and actual error on tape has gone the way of the dodo, there can never really be a final, best take of music for people like Brian Wilson. The good part about this is that listeners are treated to ever-expanding and evolving displays of inspired performance. When you follow the lineage of Beach Boys albums up to Smile, Brian's progress as a musician, songwriter and producer is so clear as to verge on distraction. In fact, he was so good that his fans took it for granted that with every new album, new frontiers would be broached. When Smile fell by the wayside, and we were left to make sense of the remaining pieces (Brian coped by writing songs about writing directions), all that hard work seemed somehow for naught. This is the bad part: chiefly, when you expect great things, good things disappoint. Neutral Milk Hotel leader/only-permanent-member Jeff Mangum has more than a little Brian in him. Musically, it seems he's quite familiar with those Smile sessions, particularly in the way he can take an ounce of pretension and turn it into all manner of a kitchen sink melodrama. And it's not just the productions themselves, but also the idiosyncrasy at work, as if personal vision somehow became a method of existence rather than a character quirk. For better or worse, a little Brian goes a long way, and in general, those afflicted (think Andy Partridge, not Sean O'Hagan) travel along similar paths: a tale of small beginnings, steady progress building to whatever masterpiece they were meant to produce, and then a sudden dimming like a dwarf star. Everything Is is a reissue of a three-song EP from 1995, with one additional song. Like Wilson's earliest work, it offers few clues as to what would come later, and is fairly innocuous on its own. However, it certainly supports the idea that Mangum has steadily progressed, at least conceptually. The title track is something like lo-fi glam folk, with a pinch of transience that only people who truly love pop can have. Unfortunately, what stood out first for me was that the singing sounded so disinterested, as if he was afraid to get too close to the microphone-- or possibly, that he simply hadn't found his voice yet. ""Snow Song, Pt. 1"" sounds even more lo-fi than the opener, mostly because of relentlessly out-of-tune guitars and Mangum's not-quite-in-synch, double-tracked vocals. From any early stage, he seems not to have been as concerned with songcraft and arrangement as weight and mood. Actually, these tunes seem to have more in common with Dennis Wilson than Brian, due primarily to the melancholy lead vocal and sincere (though verging on inept) accompaniment, but also to the almost funny surfer/hippie twang in Mangum's delivery. And then comes the obligatory (?) sound-collage piece, which I guess, given the Smile background, could make sense. There are snippets of conversation thrown in (and throughout the record), and though it reminds me of something psychedelic-- a Blue Meanies march, perhaps, or something from a fever dream-- I never figured Mangum as the LSD type. Perhaps it's just studio fun, or possibly the effects of living below sea level for so long. In any case, ""Tuesday Moon"" (not included on the previous version of this EP) wipes away most of the residue. Again, fairly light stuff, but pop is pop, and when you go down the Path Beaten by Brian, it's a prerequisite that you can write catchy tunes. Of course, we know what happened over the course of the next six years (and two very good albums), and in this light, Everything Is seems harmless. I couldn't recommend it to someone who had never heard Neutral Milk Hotel before without feeling a little guilty, but for fans who don't already know the whole story, it might serve as a nice prologue. Where I stray from my own advice is upon the realization that after 40+ years writing music, Brian Wilson has come full circle. His last album sounded good but the songwriting was a shell of his former craft. By that logic, Mangum's later stuff will be underachieving, poorly recorded fuzz-pop. Of course, it's probably not that simple, but if by some chance he has a nervous breakdown after obsessing over his next album, don't say I didn't warn you.","""How about not hitting it, but kind of doing it with your hand?

My Love I Love,Bogdan Raczynski,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d9c0084474cd0bfeec/1:1/w_160/6c903f97.gif,2001-10-03 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6639-my-love-i-love/,Rephlex,"You know those people in your life that you love dearly even though they know nothing about experimental music? They're the ones that said, ""This is weird,"" the last time you put My Bloody Valentine on the hi-fi. Normally, I just let these comments slide like water off a duck's back. I don't pick my friends based on musical taste, so I don't feel the need to explain why I don't find the music strange and how it all makes sense if you can get a broader understanding of the context it's created in. What's the point in arguing? Anyway, the other day, one of these loved ones walked in while I was listening to a new album for a Pitchfork review. The usual ""this is weird"" followed, but this time, I had a different response: ""You are absolutely right. It's fucking weird as hell."" That record was Bogdan Raczynski's My Love I Love. I don't find myself saying such a thing very often, but this is one of those rare records that sits in my collection without clear reference points. The two Raczynski albums I previously reviewed were of the spazzy, drill-n-bass variety. It was competent music with a fresh angle on a familiar, Aphex-derived sound. But this album seems related to what Raczynski has done before in only the loosest possible way. Instead of crushing breakbeats, My Love I Love is a 42-minute tone poem about love and rejection as scored for accordion, trumpet, guitar and modular synthesizer. Beats are few (less than a quarter of the tracks have any at all), and several songs feature the offhand, off-key, just plain off vocal stylings of Raczynski. Like Richard James, Raczynski is not one to let tone deafness stand in his way of his crooning. The album's second track (all songs are titled ""My Love I Love"") introduces the template for the record. A droning accordion, propelled by a rare drum break, alternates between two chords before a sad trumpet melody duets with Raczynski's wordless singing (which, incidentally, is full of melancholy ""ba-ba-ba's"" and ""la-la-la's."" At the end of the tune, he offers, ""I love you, please don't make me cry anymore,"" mapping the thematic terrain. After the first listen, I had to ask myself if Raczynski, a cranky guy famous for his pisstakes and misdirection, was offering some kind of send-up of heart-on-sleeve trends in underground music. I'm still not completely convinced that he's not, which is scary to contemplate when you're writing a review. Somewhere, Raczynski could be laughing at me for feeling what I feel about My Love I Love. But I can't help it. This album gets to me. I think what I dig so much here is that Raczynski is going way out on a limb, trying to introduce new feelings into a genre that can seem, at times, emotionally constipated. In a Kid-606 interview I read a while back, he was asked about upcoming trends in IDM. The Kid answered that he hoped music would continue to explore new avenues of expression, and he imagined that incorporating more vocals was one way it could happen. The Kid may as well have been talking about My Love I Love, because like it or not (and many will hate it, no question), this record definitely feels new and different. My Love I Love couldn't be further from how IDM is typically presented. There are no songs here called ""Atek-9.447"" or ""cul/qurk""; many of the sounds were recorded live; instead of pure geometry, the cover features a disturbing soft focus picture of Raczynski lying on a bed in the nude. Raczynski is swinging for the seats with this one. What it gets him will be a matter of some debate. One thing I don't think could be argued is that Raczynski manages to craft a handful of killer instrumental tracks, most of them lasting less than two minutes. Track 14 has a powerfully evocative melody, but it's played on a horribly distorted instrument, perhaps a distant relative of a piano that sounds an inch away from disintegration. Track 10 is only 51 seconds long, and contains a whispered Raczynski vocal that will turn off some mightily, but the vibrato keyboard figure is beautiful enough to merit a Boards of Canada comparison. The four or five tracks with accordion (most of these also contain some low-key trumpet) help to give the record a sonic center, forging a solid connection with the world of film music. I don't pretend to know exactly what Raczynski is up to here; I can only say that I like it, and yes, I do find it moving. And weird. I realize some people will laugh in my face for saying so. For god's sake, don't look at the number above and assume you'll dig this record. Listen somewhere online first if you can (Raczynski's site currently has a couple samples). But you just might find yourself falling for it the way I have.","You know those people in your life that you love dearly even though they know nothing about experimental music? They ...

Northern Electric,Cruiser,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6af5e6ef95969320dd1/1:1/w_160/9cff03f7.gif,2001-10-03 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1677-northern-electric/,Devil in the Woods,"Devil in the Woods run an interesting label. Check out owner Mike Cloward's history of the company on their website. They publish a print magazine, DIW, which features contributions from notables such as John Vanderslice, and they review lots of bands that aren't on their label. And guess what icon the review section uses for ratings: Pitchforks! Aside from the long-lost ivory bust of Ryan Schreiber, what greater tribute to the 'Fork could you ask for? Unfortunately, I can't quite decide what rating to give Northern Electric. Cruiser don't quite merit a Pitchfork-waving salute, but I can't skewer them on the end of the sharp blades, either. The seven-piece ensemble of Scots play fuzzy shoegazer pop with a twist. Surprise: they add electronic beats! Like Laika! This, unfortunately, is part of the problem. The album opener, ""Personality: Goes a Long Way,"" starts with scratching noises and bowed violin. Cue next the distorted guitar haze and drum loops, which thump in a crude, almost militaristic pattern. The melody makes for cutesy pop, as do the predictably understated female vocals. Singer Caroline Barber leaves subtle trace of her Scottish accent when she repeats, ""Things are never the same as before"" over and over again. She's wrong, though-- at least in regards to the song. It sounds nice but there's little ingenuity, reminding me most of a Polara album whose title is the exact opposite of its content: Formless/Functional. Similarly, Cruiser's problem is that their beats are too structured and repetitious. The Chemical Brothers-style breakbeat of ""Blown,"" for instance, bludgeons you with its obviousness throughout the song, and the ""Sesame Street"" melody that chimes along doesn't help. ""Hardly Even Here"" mixes its percussive wallop more carefully with the sweet, dense hum of guitar and keyboards, incubating a frozen Dots and Loops-period Stereolab embryo. But the beats never transcend decorative status, and the grooves lack the requisite amount of bass and vigor to be conventionally danceable. By the time you reach the wannabe-Bows spoken word of ""Air Ecosse,"" the only thing shaking might be your head. ""International Space Station"" stands out amongst these drowsy daydreams. The Richard D. James-patented thoom-chiks actually cycle in a progression, filling in the gaps between ringing guitar and cello-- and when they fade out, leaving only an echoing piano, you'll miss them. But the latter half of the album proves that Cruiser sound best when their more organic elements take forefront. Here, the beats exist only as simple drum-machine tracks that don't overpower the atmospheric e-bows and delay pedals. The title song is a particularly beautiful example. And now that she can be heard, Barber's voice provides a soft, pleasing counterpoint to the banjo strums and brass backing. But the other problem lies in the production. Rather than an overpowering wave of sonic force, all of the songs on Northern Electric are trapped behind a blurry wall of sound. The muted effect makes it difficult to hear the individual timbres of the instruments spread throughout, including harmonium, mandolin and glockenspiel. If Cruiser could program more detailed electronic interventions and avoid (or amplify) the muddy noise of the mastering work, they might record a really striking album. They have any number of examples to choose from-- the flawless integration of drum-n-bass and ethereality on Love Spirals Downward's Flux is just one. As it is, Northern Electric's wintry atmospheres are like being a passenger in a car hugging the curves of a rural road in the midst of a December storm: you don't feel protected by the window separating you from the snow falling outside. You want to escape, to roll on the ground and face the elements firsthand.","Devil in the Woods run an interesting label. Check out owner Mike Cloward's history of the company on their ...

In the Sun Lines,Tara Jane O’Neil,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9df5e6ef95969322a80/1:1/w_160/3659ffc9.gif,2001-10-02 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6005-in-the-sun-lines/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"Outside there's rain. My feet are cold, and I am sleepy. My living room is a mess of crusty, unusable brushes, jewel cases, and paint-splattered newspaper. An especially aggressive shade of mandarin orange, recently applied, covers some walls but not others, and all of my ugly furniture is crowded into a small space in the center of the room. Nevertheless, I'm relaxed to the point of guilt. I don't give a fuck if this place never gets cleaned up-- just as long as this disc keeps spinning. O'Neil's slippery, sireny, poisonously beautiful voice cuts through the disorder of her richly unnerving arrangements and makes me want to hit repeat until I rub off my right index-fingerprint. On last year's Peregrine, O'Neil broke from her Sonora Pine/Retsin/Rodan stylistic past with a haunting and moody, yet still somehow ineffectual collection of songs. But on In the Sun Lines, she's refined her approach and forged new ways to, as her label's website put it, ""paint with sound."" What she paints is not always quite comforting. ""This Morning,"" an eight-minute dirge-lite of a song, is an effective and very repetitive soundscape of claustrophobic piano tinkling, ominous acoustic guitar overtones, and O'Neil's ghostly vocalizing. The musical arrangement, except for the decorative guitar bits, could have been a loop. The slow, chugging pace of the song sounds like muffled machinery, and the occasional accordion exhalation sounds as if radioed in from someone else's nightmare. The opening track, ""The Winds You Came Here On,"" is among the album's most straightforward and prettiest. The song's widely spaced chords are strung together by lightly struck and submerged single notes. O'Neil's voice is sweet and accusatory, singing the tensest of melodies, until all the buildup spills over into the gorgeously simple and vocalless chorus. ""Your Rats Are,"" with Ida's Dan Littleton guesting, is a southern-flavored mood-fest of sweepy sounds and sudden cellos that burst like curses from a deranged person. The song is an ode of sorts to New York City, but the feel couldn't be further removed from the metropolis. The sleigh-bell percussion and chanting vocals provide the album's darkest, most evocative moments. ""In This Rough,"" Sun Lines' seventh and finest track, demonstrates O'Neil's ""songwriter"" qualities better than any other. She sings the album's best melody over the waltz beat suggested by her guitar strumming, while off-color and fluid-sounding guitar notes mark the harmony with dissonance like intermittent rain drops. The charmingly named ""New Harm"" sees the album out the door with a clutter of nerve-wracking chimes and the kinds of sounds a grandfather clock might make if it could double over in pain. The song has no vocals and no structure, save for the forced symmetry of its beginning and ending sections. Instead, it seeks only to reinforce the album's main theme: uneasiness. The ending gesture is almost excessive, in that whatever disconcertion O'Neil was trying to cause in the listener is long established by the final track. Still, In the Sun Lines is a resounding success on many fronts. The beauty of O'Neil's melodies stick with you, but no more and no less than the pervading sense of danger and fear that emanates from her tense musical arrangements. The net effect of these opposing forces is a resigned and drugged relaxation. Hopefully, though, O'Neil will tease out her gifts for melody and ""song"" on her next effort, in addition to pursuing perfection in the form of these beautiful but stifling mood-pieces.","Outside there's rain.

Other Animals,Erase Errata,by: Daphne Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc97c0084474cd0c2b11/1:1/w_160/ecaf0b58.gif,2001-10-02 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2822-other-animals/,Troubleman Unlimited,"It's a bummer to walk down St. Mark's in New York City and see all the 12-year-old punk kids dolled up in the shredded threads, patches ablaze, cocking total disdain for every sight and smell. It makes me feel old. Long copping out to the grim reality of commuting, college loans, bullshit office banter, and having to leave before the bar gets gonzo to go home, that manic-tipped sense of urgency is sorta gone for me. Also, a decade of Tortoise-ing has left indie rock and assorted sub-genres decadent, non-verbal and completely without social comment. Perhaps that's why there's been this dubious post-punk/no-wave revival. People were all over the Bush/Reagan similes a year ago, and at least musically, it's all come true-- corporate metal, synthy pop and the angry, newly articulate underground have boomed. Witness Erase Errata, four ladies who rock harder and smarter, and with better beats than most stunningly hung left ones. Combining the jumble of DNA, the snarl vox of the Scissor Girls, and the leaping bass of the Birthday Party, they have just the right ratio of catchiness to antagonism, and they work it as a ploy for repeat listens. Other Animal is their first full-length and it almost topples itself with cranky excitement at the venture. No moment goes without movement-- there's a sense of nervous anticipation in each drum's snap. Jenny Hoysten's carefully controlled sing-speak vocals have that blessed Kim Gordon tunelessness that sometimes stress into vibrato-heavy upturn. Her articulated sentiments drink from the close-bottomed well of angry girl-punk topics: fucked politics, capitalism, and adult-hating, with an occasional curious rhetoric about other species' superiority. (C'mon, ladies, really. Is the Rhesus gonna fix that warble in your bass cabinet? Monitor international food supplies? Hook up your cable?) Still, they seem smart enough to shade the evils of the western world in its sexiest time signatures, altered chord structures, and borderline linear structures. To borrow some St. Mark's mentality, ""That's using the man to fuck himself."" Well said, Sid. Unlike Le Tigre, with whom they've held the stage and will be invariably contrasted with in the limited lady-pool of pop culture's mind, Erase Errata seems like a band that plays music first. Both will shake booties, convince other girls to plug in, and make it on the cover of Venus and other grrl-friendly mags. But Errata's got a momentum based not on star power, preprogramming, slideshows or calisthenics. Like the Gang of Four, Josef K or any band of borderline fame during post-punk's brief flicker, Errata pulls energy from the ever-bountiful over soul of dissatisfaction we've hid in our minds for the day to day. Channeled to a challenging rock context, it's simultaneously dead serious and hideously absurd. And that's why it works. Tracks like ""High Society"" expose the recording's tin-covered gaudiness-- all distortion and mid-range-- which somehow robs the delirious sex beat of its urge. That the song grows from a Confusion is Sex-style noise jam only adds to the jumble as Errata spend equal time rocking their cocks as trying to cut others' off. But man haters they aren't-- just smart chicks pomo-ing about with their patchwork. Being that they do rock, and that they do espouse the lines, I fear them somehow getting a Hanna-head that they're some kind of role model. One can only hope this god-forsaken caterwaul they've produced stays true to its lean turn, finding musical progress in changing times and not in changing fads.","It's a bummer to walk down St. Mark's in New York City and see all the 12-year-old punk ...

The New Geocentric World of...,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Luke Buckman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fefea9e61561daa4455/1:1/w_160/caefeaa4.gif,2001-10-02 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20-the-new-geocentric-world-of/,Squealer,"Japan is a strange place for music, a cauldron of underground activity which continually threatens to bubble to the surface and vanquish the world of rock once and for all. Very few of these underground artists have made a name for themselves on American shores (Boredoms, Melt-Banana, Ruins), but the number of artists that continue to ply their craft continues to mount, all the while unbeknownst to us poor souls across the Pacific. At the forefront of this underground movement is guitarist Makoto Kawabata and the noise freaks of Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso UFO (short for ""Underground Freak Out""). A self-described ""millennial hippy group,"" Acid Mothers Temple have been traveling the world, unleashing their particular brand of psychedelic bliss upon an unwitting public for four years. Releasing three albums early in their career on the Japanese underground label, PSF, the group slowly built a name for itself, specializing in what Kawabata termed ""trip"" music. It's a meltdown of entire genres and movements-- drawing equally from French folk and Western psychedelia-- all re-imagined in a form intended to liquefy your brain. Part of a community known as the Acid Mothers Temple Soul Collective, Kawabata and friends have been inhabiting the Japanese countryside and living out their own unique brand of utopianism for the last few years. Recalling the countercultural spirit of the 60's and other hippie communes, Acid Mothers even paid homage to that Californian group of restaurant-owning weirdos, Ya Ho Wha 13, with the album The Father Moo and the Black Sheep. But with this, their first release on Massachusetts' Squealer label, Acid Mothers Temple finally free the rein on their noise parade. I'm not sure if the Acid Mothers are trying to win any converts with their most recent offering, but the make-or-break point (if you will) for potential fans will undoubtedly come at 40 seconds into The New Geocentric World, as ""Psycho Buddah"" opens with the mantra, ""What?,"" in a sound loop that teases the listener into thinking they've brought home some of that experimental locked-groove wankery. But a few seconds later, the Acid Mothers annihilate all preconceived notions. Dissecting the cacophony, the intense sonic war being waged on human ears, is futile. Best to sit back and let your brain bleed. I asked to hear this at the local record shop, and within one minute of the first track, people had either fled with fingers plugging their ears, or were completely rapt and entrenched within a new world of sonic dimensions. ""Psycho Buddah"" is unrelenting, moving at a furious pace for over 21 minutes and incorporating Kawabata's searing guitar work within the steady framework of the Acid Mothers' thunderous rhythm section. Cotton Casino, the group's only female, constantly pushes the gurgles, loops, drones and hisses of her synthesizer into the forefront. The song teeters on a hazardous precipice, looking over the edge and waiting to fall, but Kawabata's guitar is the anchor here, effortlessly able to rein all the others into his sonic realm. His ability to create deafening walls of feedback, hiss, and skronk, coupled with his penchant for tearing it all to shreds with a seething solo, is a thing of pure, unadulterated beauty. I'll say it right now: Kawabata is a guitar god. And these other guys are no slouches, either, as they prove while seamlessly incorporating bagpipes (!) and Jew's harps (!!) into this freeform freakout without ever looking back. The next track, ""Space Age Ballad,"" is a haunting acoustic number that recalls contemporaries Ghost and their psychedelic balladry. Comparatively short at four minutes, this track is mere preparation for the slow-burning ""You're Still Now Near Me Everytime."" Guest vocalist Haco remains the focal point for the first minutes of the song until, at around the five-minute mark, Kawabata emerges with yet another guitar solo-- a trend on each track so far. A bit tiring? For your average indie rock band, yeah. But this is psychedelic madness, and the sheer joy and inventiveness with which Kawabata plays puts most of his contemporaries to shame, and his willingness to explore every possible dimension of sound succeeds with a creation of textures that seem wholly original. Unafraid to don their cartoon masks as well, Acid Mothers unveil their frenetic update on Hendrix's ""Foxy Lady"" with the scorching ""Occie Lady,"" a pounding, speedfreak revision that subsumes Hendrix's riff within a mountainous din of thuds, screeches, and shrieking guitar. The closing track is a pure departure from everything preceding, abandoning the blistering guitarwork and crashing rhythm sections for a 15-minute drone workout. Here, Kawabata's guitar and the song's multi-layered structure evokes the theatrics of My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3. Acid Mothers Temple pride themselves on the drughead obsession of being ""cosmic troubadours"" in continual search for interstellar communication. But unlike the shoegazers with which their music has so much in common, Makoto Kawabata sincerely believes he's communicating with the cosmos. A strange guy to be sure, but most great musicians are given to some eccentricities.","Japan is a strange place for music, a cauldron of underground activity which continually threatens to bubble to the surface ...

United by Fate,Rival Schools,by: Adam Dlugacz,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27e9d034d5c69bf2bef/1:1/w_160/2719ad18.gif,2001-10-02 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6794-united-by-fate/,Island,"Now that we have seen the golden age of hardcore-punk come and go, there are two rules we can ascertain: hardcore heroes do not age gracefully, and adding some melody and harmonies does not make you a groundbreaking artist. Perhaps it's because hardcore bands are frequently populated by young angry white boys from the 'burbs, screaming real loud and saying a whole lot of nothing. Maybe that's fun when you're in high school, but eventually, the anger subsides and you realize that the jocks who once made fun of you are no longer part of your life. But these bands invariably get in trouble when they attempt to make the transition from punk rock to pop. It starts like this: the hardcore band from suburbs gets bored playing verse/chorus/verse, and suddenly realizes that their singer can actually carry a bit of a tune. Then, they start buying records by Sunny Day Real Estate and the Promise Ring-- maybe a Superchunk or Smiths record-- and the next thing you know, they sound like watered down imitations of those exact bands. And now, instead of a thousand groups playing borrowed Minor Threat or Youth of Today chords, they're all ""expanding their sound"" and wondering why nobody gives a shit. For proof, take the career of one Walter Schreifels. He started out in the seminal New York hardcore band Gorilla Biscuits, one of the most revered bands of the genre. But after growing bored with the limits of the sound, Walter started Quicksand. With Quicksand, he did what few ex-hardcore guys do: he created a valid and vital musical entity, and even managed to sniff a bit of the success that only a major label band can. Quicksand took the anger and frenetic energy of hardcore, melded it with melody, complex strong structure and lyrics that applied to people who no longer lived with their parents. And until Quicksand broke up, Walter had managed to avoid the downfall that so commonly afflicts other hardcore frontmen. He even created the entity CIV so that he could relive some of his hardcore days in a fashionable, ready-for MTV manner. Now Walter's back with Rival Schools, and their major label debut, United by Fate. For the project, he's brought along drummer Sammy Siegler, who's played in, like, every New York hardcore band ever, and most recently in Glassjaw. Also in tow are bassist Cache Tolman of CIV, and Ian Love, who also appeared in a ton of hardcore bands on second guitar. Unfortunately, Walter's third hurrah amounts to a bunch of ex-hardcore heroes who have-- surprise!-- not aged gracefully. And the music? Neither groundbreaking, nor even ""really good."" United by Fate isn't a terrible record if you're a fan of late-90's alterna-rock. The guitars build and crash, the drums and bass provide a muscular backdrop, and Walter's vocals are melodic without sounding like the guy took singing lessons. Yet, despite all Schreifels' promises that the band would lead him in a new direction, United by Fate sounds a hell of a lot like the first Quicksand record, only a tad more melodic and not nearly as tight. Worse, the rampant energy of Quicksand's best records is entirely absent, replaced with a sort of synthetic studio energy that seems forced at best. At this point in his career, it would be nice to see Walter and his mates blaze a new path. Instead, they seem stuck on playing the same old chords under a different name. Yes, I'm afraid it's true: hardcore heroes do not age gracefully, and adding some melody and harmonies does not make you a groundbreaking artist. Rival Schools, the end is nigh.","Now that we have seen the golden age of hardcore-punk come and go, there are two rules we can ascertain ...

All the past moments of my life were crushed into an instant under the fulcrum of perception. To evacuate work, we had to locate our boss. We found him on the roof, taking pictures. You can't quite see the Pentagon from downtown D.C., but the smoke was billowing up on the horizon. All I wanted to do was to go home, curl up under some sheets and drift off to soothing music. But on my return, I found myself transfixed to the television, unable to escape multiplying crash angles and paranoid predictions. Since then, my thoughts have never been far from the crisis. That was the legacy of the day-- all other concerns seemed trivial. What was the difference between ambient and ethereal to the man and woman who clasped hands and leapt from one of the towers? But I finally did lie down to listen to a new album. Tap, tap, tap came the percussion out of the speakers, slow and regular. A series of chimes followed, like the ring of prepared drinking glasses. Hushed guitar reverb rose, soon followed by a theremin singing and the occasional buzz of some errant appliance. Five minutes later, soft female vocals materialized-- wordless vowels that mixed with the symphonic swells. The song progressed from fluid ether to short, pulsing waves, a series of psychedelic organ crests and troughs similar to Philip Glass' Glassworks. The tension relaxed. I felt calm. Mus is Fran Gayo and Monica Vacas, a male/female duo from Spain. Normally, they release music in their native country on the Acuarela label. Reviews characterize their early material as electronic-oriented and their later work as more guitar-based. But Darla Records has offered them entry into their Bliss Out series, allowing them to show off a very gentle mix of the two influences. Aida's thirty-six minutes and nine seconds make for the kind of organic ambience that stirs little excitement but charms those who give it a chance. Oh, and there's just two songs. The aforementioned ""Aquel Inviernu"" pauses around the 13th minute. The silence is broken with acoustic guitar strums and Vacas' near-whispered vocals. Darla's choice of the series' title seems ironic when you consider past contributors-- from Amp to Fuxa to American Analog Set. ""Bliss Out"" here signifies a drifting, shoegazing mode rather than the generic sense of joy. Vacas sings in Asturian, a Spanish dialect used in the principality of Asturia, and her understated delivery hints at melancholia: ""Siempre dormir, siempre llorar"" (""always sleeps, always cries""). Gayo harmonizes behind her, audible mostly as a hum. The instrumental strains stream together and the piece ends in keyboard minimalism near the twenty-minute mark. The second song, ""A Cielu Abiertu"" (""The Open Door"") continues like an edit of the first. A piano steps slowly in Harold Budd fashion, and music-box chimes tinkle innocently while Vacas graces us again with her lovely voice. And afterwards, Mus surprise with a warm horn melody and a sudden hiss, like bus brakes sighing. The thirteen-minute suite ends in the sound of rushing rainwater. Change a letter of the band's name, and you have their closest relation: Iceland's Múm make similar electronic post-folk, simple and filled with emotional warmth. Mus offered the calmness I craved then; catharsis through excruciatingly painful music would have required energy I didn't possess, and I wasn't feeling any of that happy music. For a short while there, time flowed in the opposite direction. The half-hour passed far too quickly.",,7.6,
DE9: Closer to the Edit,Richie Hawtin,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c07cc0084474cd0c31c5/1:1/w_160/c35a8d4f.gif,2001-10-01 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3770-de9-closer-to-the-edit/,Novamute,"It was meant to be a routine visit to Dr. Hawtin. I was expecting the usual treatment: he would slightly distend my ectopic eyeball to reveal the sinewy mess of the deformed optic nerve of my right eye; he would smear a clear salve of his own manufacture using a modified Q-tip, and then gently push my eyeball back into my head in an unconventional position. But not this visit. Though Dr. Hawtin was the same calmly welcoming bald gentleman I've learnt to trust and admire, I walked into his familiarly anechoic and odorless office, expecting to be greeted with a smile of, ""Have I got something innovative and unregulated for you!"" But since he's about the only person that isn't skeeved out by my disfigurement (or question how I'm even able to feed myself in anything resembling an acceptable manner), I have learnt to resign myself to his unique skills. Knowing that my ocular defect has impeded my ability to communicate as most other people do, Dr. Hawtin and I have resorted to formulating a touch-language. He asks how I'm doing and I reply by touching the tip of his nose: ""Just great."" But this time, I don't wait for him to follow up. I am concerned. Dr. Hawtin's office includes some equipment I've never seen before. There's a turntable-cum-centrifuge linked to a translucent laptop computer. The computer's screen brightly displays the words, ""Final Scratch: initialization complete. Press F1 to commence procedure."" I stroke the knuckles of Dr. Hawtin's right hand: ""What's going on?"" The doctor straightens his back with pride and then leads me to the Final Scratch equipment. ""In collaboration with other experimental physicians, I have collected an array of three hundred sonic tools and arranged them into one therapeutic sequence. The course of treatment I propose that you undergo will alleviate some of your difficulties. As we've discussed before, the optical nerve of your ectopic eye is fused with the optic nerve of your other, correctly situated eye. We've discussed that removal of your ectopic eye is not feasible without severing the conjoined optic nerve and thus inducing permanent blindness. ""What I and other researchers have discovered is that application of certain rhythmic tones and frequencies can cause nerve tissue to fold in on itself and woundlessly seal itself off from the greater central system. My recommendation is that you agree to have the nerve of your ectopic eye treated by this DE9 process. Understand that you will lose sight in that eye, but given its location, and the fact that you've never received anything but utterly confusing signals from it, I predict a substantial improvement in your quality of life. This work continues and improves upon my previous Decks, EFX and 909 minimal tone surgery, but I've greatly reduced the duration of each sample and the therapeutic payload. The results are dramatic and with negligible side-effects."" Touching Dr. Hawtin's forehead, I asked him what the treatment involved. ""The Final Scratch equipment is essentially an immensely sensitive triggering unit which allows the operator to cue up any one of the stored therapeutic DE9 sound samples. Some of these samples I have created myself, but the majority of them were produced by my esteemed colleagues in the minimal community-- Professor Carl Craig, Dr. Janek Sienkiewicz, Dr. Stewart Walker, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Dr. Peter Speiss, to mention but a few. I have trimmed their tones to either a single tone or loop and collated them into the Hawtin DE9 minimal tone surgical rhythm database. ""What I will do is remove the eyeball-- just as I always do during these examinations-- and attach a micro-speaker to the exposed nerve. I will then use the DE9 turntable device to cue up and release from the database each minimal rhythm according to that pattern's therapeutic ability. After the fifty minutes of the DE9 process, the abnormal bifurcation of your optic nerve will be so withered by the relentless synthetic percussion as to be unable to conduct signals to your brain. We'll then just snip the eyeball out and you'll be able to swallow, talk and eat solid foods. In addition to removing of the physical abnormality, DE9 tones have a second set of harmonics. These frequencies will deliver signals to your brain to re-route visual data from the now useless section of your optic nerve. Your brain will adapt to its compromised situation and your normal eye will be instructed to take on 100% of visual duties."" Dr. Hawtin perceived that I was experiencing a mixture of trepidation and excitement, and added with characteristic candor, ""Unrelenting maintenance of intensity is key to success of the operation. Open your mouth! Let's yank that peering sucker out of its lair!""","It was meant to be a routine visit to Dr. Hawtin. I was expecting the usual treatment: he would slightly ...

Live a L'Olympia,Jeff Buckley,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d5c0084474cd0c035d/1:1/w_160/49d055bd.gif,2001-10-01 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/993-live-a-lolympia/,Columbia,"Many religions prescribe time for meditation. It's a concept I'm sort of attracted to. I've even attempted some of the traditional methods, but I always get distracted: my foot falls asleep, my ass starts hurting from being sat on all weird, or I have intense, apocalyptic visions like the ones in Ken Russell's Altered States. (Incidentally, being transformed into a cro-magnon and busting into a zoo in the dead of night to consume live bovine is highly overrated.) I'm not really sure why I attempt to put myself through such torture, though, when I know that music can provide the obliteration of surroundings I seek. Jeff Buckley is always there for me. The first ten tracks from Buckley's second officially released live album, Live a L'Olympia, are culled from two shows that took place on July 6th and 7th in 1995, almost a year after the release of Grace. The recordings are sourced from an analog audio cassette that was found among Buckley's possessions after his death. For a major label concert release, there's a high amount of noise present, but this is significantly outweighed by the quality of the performances documented. The liner notes call these shows ""high points of [Buckley's] performing career,"" a fact that's quite apparent in the material, which is by and large pretty stunning stuff. Such is the case with the two songs that open the album, ""Lover You Should've Come Over"" and ""Dream Brother."" Buckley's band are a focused and tight bunch who can only complement Buckley's ecstatic falsettos. Both tracks exceed seven minutes in length, yet there's not a second lacking in energy. Buckley begins the verse of ""Dream Brother"" with a barely audible, steadily repeating guitar note that builds to a reverbed crash as he hammers the pickup. The arrangement isn't very distant from the performance on last year's Mystery White Boy, but this recording seems somehow more poignant. Then there's ""Eternal Life,"" and the cover of the MC5 classic, ""Kick Out the Jams,"" while expose Buckley's subtle death metal leanings, allowing them to gawkily escape into the open. I doubt the fans are looking for more of that after the version of the former song on Mystery White Boy. Then again, I've always preferred the more minimal Live at Sin-E version of the song to Grace's studio version. Which leads me to the only problematic flaw of L'Olympia: at times, the live energy defies capture on tape, and at others, it actually interrupts the performances. Buckley stops in the middle of both ""Je N'en Connais pas la Fin"" and ""Hallelujah."" On the latter, he even asks the audience if they want him to finish the song. When heard, the question seems to be an angry retort to an impolite audience, but according to a statement made by Buckley's mom in the liner notes, Jeff was reveling in the support of his audience-- something that was relatively new to him at the time of this recording. The audience joins in to sing ""Hallelujah."" Buckley proclaims, ""This is so rock and roll,"" and proceeds to sing harmony with his active audience. But while this would have been an astounding experience in person, the recording doesn't capture much of the audience, and some of Buckley's complementary vocal lines seem awkward. Later, the disc concludes with a soundboard recording of ""What Will You Sa,"" recorded at 1995's Festival of Sacred Music, which was held in a small village in western France. Here, Azerbaijani singer Alim Qazimov adds vocals and plays tabla, with Buckley occasionally mimicking Qazimov's middle-eastern vocal turns, making it a uniquely engaging track in Buckley's live oeuvre. Live a L'Olympia hasn't yet been issued domestically, and it isn't listed on Columbia's American release schedule. For Buckley fans, I personally consider ""What Will You Say"" to be worth the hassle of an international order. And if you care to sing along, Jeff will harmonize. You might just forget where you are.","Many religions prescribe time for meditation. It's a concept I'm sort of attracted to. I've even attempted ...

Rejected Unknown,Daniel Johnston,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba15eb335119a49ec948/1:1/w_160/3ce837b9.gif,2001-10-01 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4281-rejected-unknown/,Gammon,"Most people think artists, by their very nature, are a little deranged. I would argue that mathematicians and scientists are even more so. In fact, what makes some artistic types seem a little off-balance is their scientist-like tendencies: their inability to accept the everyday assumptions that make up what us ""normal folk"" call the mundane, and their unwavering adherence to logic-- albeit an inner logic that makes perfect sense in their own minds, yet is mysterious to us. I believe that the struggle to convey this inner logic to the outside world is what gives birth to a lot of artistic expression. Much has been made of Daniel Johnston's bouts with mental illness. But the point is that they are ""bouts,"" as in the boxing term; they are battles. And out of these battles are born songs that reveal much about human nature in general, and not just the mind of an manic depressive. The fact is, Johnston's mental illness does not make up his central characteristic as a songwriter, though it does color it significantly. But if that's all his songs are-- just expressions of mania and lunacy-- there would be little recognition and identification with them, and they wouldn't be as moving as they so often are. Their main concerns are universal human concerns, though they're expressed with such idiosyncrasy that they're often taken as mad ramblings. The main themes on Rejected Unknown are the themes Johnston has explored throughout much of his career: hopeless longing, unrequited love, and as might be gathered from the album's title, fear of rejection. This fear probably took on very real terms for Johnston as he was finally dropped from Atlantic Records after being held for years in contractual limbo. As it is, it's been seven years since his last proper album (1994's Fun), and judging from the resulting music, the time has been well spent. Fun saw little musical involvement from Johnston, lending the impression that he was led by the hand by a pack of svengalis. But Rejection Unknown is unmistakably Johnston's album; he sings and plays piano and guitar, and even adds some percussion to the oddly quirky pop songs. With the aid of new medicines and treatments, Johnston is now more together than he's ever sounded before, and his music is all the better for it. It lays to waste the idea that his insanity is at the root of his songwriting. But don't get me wrong. Rejected Unknown is still full of his, uh, highly personal mythology-- touchstones such as the Beatles, Captain America, and Casper the Friendly Ghost are still prominently featured motifs-- but the main thought you come away with is not, ""Damn, this is some crazy shit,"" but, ""Damn, these are good songs."" There are some duds, songs that just hang on too long (like the characters in his songs) or are just too sappy, but overall it's one of the strongest efforts of his career. ""Impossible Love"" begins the album on a note familiar to anyone who's ever heard a Johnston album. He sings, ""You hurt me so bad/ You were the best friend I ever had,"" in his boyish voice-- a voice that puts a lot of people off, but is as distinctive as his surrealistic artwork which graces the cover. ""Funeral Girl"" continues the theme of lost love (actually, this theme pretty much sums up most of Johnston's work, but then again, it also pretty much sums up what pop music as a whole is about), and ""Dream Scream"" is an almost scary portrait of hopelessly longing for someone you can't have. But what puts Johnston in rare company (not just the Syd Barrett/Roky Erickson camp where he's too often hastily placed) are lines like this one from ""Love Forever"": ""I'm thinking about our yesterday/ We were the best for each other.../ I haven't given up/ It's been 15 years."" Fifteen years?! Damn. I mean, I've had crushes. Some of them have lasted a really long time. But 15 years! It reminds me of that line from the Smiths' ""Half a Person"" where the narrator relates he's ""spent six full years of [his] life on [someone's] trail."" Most songwriters wouldn't be so bold. They'd back off a little, hedge their bets. They wouldn't want to strain the listener's credulity. They'd say something like, ""I saw you a few months later."" A long time, but not too long. But we're talking about some serious feelings here-- the kind of feelings that demand a song be written. And that's the kind of necessity that informs many of Johnston's songs. They have a feeling of a life-or-death-ness that makes the work of lesser songwriters seem trivial.","Most people think artists, by their very nature, are a little deranged.

Tall Dark Hill,Wolfie,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa6c5e6ef959693215a6/1:1/w_160/424a73b7.gif,2001-10-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8733-tall-dark-hill/,MarchMarch,"After Flickerstick pulled a thrilling, narrow victory for the title of VH1's ""Bands on the Run"" series, the dudes, as they would tend to call themselves, ignited their van and set off to conquer the world through a set of gigs at overpriced theme bars and restaurants. The highlight of the Planet Hollywood show in Cleveland was certainly the all-you-can-eat bin of Bruce Willis's Cap'n Crunch-breaded chicken fingers. Though, another outstanding moment came when one of the ladies from ""V.I.P."" kissed the guitarist on the lips at the Harley Davidson Café in Phoenix. The bassist even scored some oral sex in Portland, but later realized that sucking off the chef for free Rainforest Reubens isn't exactly Vince Neil behavior. So this was the rock and roll life, they thought. Flickerstick played with some really great upcoming bands on this tour. Dis Aster Master, Konstrunktion, Hot Molly, No Soup for U, and Gearbox all influenced the guys to no end, and you can bet bits of their sound will rub off. But audience members at the House of Blues show in Chicago, mostly there for the free admission and Blind Lemon Jefferson Key Lime Pie, couldn't help but wonder: who was this spunky mop-top band opening for Flickerstick? And why were they so brutally awful? Wolfie. With the title of their 1999 sophomore album (notable only for sort of having the same cover as Travis' The Invisible Band), Wolfie asked, ""Where's Wolfie?"" Tall Dark Hill, the follow up, answers with a resounding ""over there."" On the opening track, Joe Ziemba, singer and writer of such tunes as ""Little Bee Is Dancin',"" announces in a nasally whimper, ""After years of struggling, I finally believe in myself."" Hey, if opening for Flickerstick fulfills you, godspeed. It's your career zenith. This third album sees Wolfie flirting with heavier 70's textures. But as the band blindly stumbles into more conventional realms (in that the songs no longer sound recorded by infants in a sock), the more pathetic they seem. ""Everybody Knows How to Cry"" blatantly, criminally, shamelessly borrows Marc Bolan's Slider boogie, but ends up more closely approximating the cartoon-rock of Bolan's Saturday morning ""Marc!"" show. Even worse, Wolfie evokes Led Zeppelin on ""You Are a Woman."" You're better off watching Jason Lee lip-synch ""Fever Dog."" Of course, any attempt by Wolfie to improve should be commended, but even after three albums, they've still only got the reach of a Thalidomide baby. Godforsaken musicianship imbued Awful Mess Mystery, Wolfie's debut, with near-haphazard art-rock style, to which its title intentionally nods. Their complete lack of talent brought the sound closer to U.S. Maple than the Zombies comparison so often flung around in their press releases. The songwriting eventually turned melodic by simple means of not being atonal. On Tall Dark Hill, Ziemba runs his pipes up and down standard scales, jumps the standard octaves, and ooh's the standard aah's when he feels like it, but this should never be mistaken for actual pop skill. Melody oozes from every jingle, elevator, bird, radio, and whistling business man. We're cocooned by melody. Why should lowest-rung mimicry be commended? Harmony is the easiest of sounds for the human animal to successfully exude. Anyone can hum. It's the unexpected notes that measure talent. At the very least, surround yourself with people who can play their instruments; drummer RJ Porter propels ""Living Island Is Real"" with cowbell and kiddie-pool cymbal splashes, but handles the traps like he's playing with his feet. Modern twee bands oddly pay homage to the 60's by approximating the bubblegum bands. It's not the Kinks, Beatles, and Zombies these kids are after; it's the Ohio Express, 1920 Fruit Gum Company, the Archies, and whatever other names Kasenetz and Katz wrote under. That's all well and fine. I won't start a debate on the merits of crafted, commercial pop. But where these twee bands lose the path is in forgetting that those songs were recorded by accomplished session players, in posh studios, with teams of professional writers. What's the point in hearing three college kids from rural Illinois hack away their very own ""Sugar Sugar?"" If you want bubblegum, you toss a stick of Wrigley's in your mouth, not some sap-ball your retarded cousin pulled off an acacia tree. Whenever Amanda Lyons opens her mouth, the songs drastically veer towards early That Dog material. These days, That Dog might be working at Hot Dog on a Stick, as one of their videos depicted. And those girls were the daughters of producer Lenny Waronker, and jazz legend Charlie Haden, one of the most skilled musicians of the 20th century. Genetics have a funny way of working. But the gods have an even greater sense of humor. If Awful Mess Mystery was the joke, the aspirations of Tall Dark Hill can only be the punchline.","After Flickerstick pulled a thrilling, narrow victory for the title of VH1's\n\ ""Bands on the Run"" series, the ...

Invisible Airline,Q-Burns Abstract Message,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1cc13d19756521386fa/1:1/w_160/bea5516b.gif,2001-09-30 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6624-invisible-airline/,Astralwerks,"In the three years since the breakbeat downtempo soul of 1998's Feng Shui was released, Q-Burns Abstract Message's lone operator Michael Donaldson has changed his allegiance. Invisible Airline is more than a tad influenced by Everything but the Girl's salon-ready deep house. And though the breakbeats of his past aren't entirely absent, they're definitely subdued, and their quelled presence gives this album a maturer, more adult-orientated sound. Gak. On Feng Shui, Donaldson began to introduce guest vocalists. On this latest album, he's granted access to six guests spread out over eight of the album's twelve tracks. Lisa Shaw-- an apprentice diva who's appeared with Ital Shuur's Milk and Honey project, on DJ Swingsett's Sights Unseen and collaborated with Jay Denes for the sofa-house staple, ""Always""-- gets the most exposure. Once the opening track, a lightly congaphonic instrumental called ""Hey! Star City,"" has faded out, Shaw takes over for ""Shame."" Emerging from an fx-haze, Shaw sings of leaving a significant other and not caring what she's left behind. Riding Donaldson's ticky-ticky percussion, a Fripp-like guitar charts an ethereal course. Here, Shaw tries to match the star-fondling guitar with hints of Cocteau Twins frontwoman Elizabeth Fraser's celestial phrasing. I grudgingly like ""Shame"" until a steel drum ensemble takes a ""why this? why now?"" eight-bar solo. Then, after the incongruous Caribbean interlude, Donaldson falls back to looping, phasing and EQing all the other elements until the allotted six minutes are up. ""Shame"" will rightfully appear on many second-division Chillin' on Salinas Beach-type compilations. But it will never achieve everlasting fame in the canon of sublime disco. ""Differently"" continues Shaw's hardly-winning streak, this time joined by percussionist Eugene Snowden. The track is a ballad written from the POV of someone who's died with a few regrets. ""Know there's a vision of my world you'll see/ If I could I would do it differently/ Mmmm..."" Shaw's delivery of these potentially poignant banalities is as though she were reciting a bus schedule. I grant she trembles a bit before she mumbles, ""Ain't nobody singing/ Don't want to bring it back/ Yeah, no need/ Don't hear nobody singing/ Don't want to bring me back."" But trembling is no guarantee of provoking empathy. Meanwhile, percussionist Snowden, though credited, is undetectable. Unless that's him slumped against the patch-cord container, clapping. Bereft of (or abandoned by) his collaborators, Donaldson fares much better. The instrumental ""Amusement Park Heart"" returns to the nu-disco of the opening track and proves that Donaldson is a capable motivator of the human glute. Unfortunately, the track doesn't quite reach the same intensity as his early victories, ""Enter/Other"" or ""Bugeyed Sunglasses"" (both compiled on 1998's Oeuvre). The blues duo of slide guitarist Elmo Williams and percussionist Hezekiah Early guest on Donaldson's reworking of ""Mother's Dead,"" the cheery opener of their 1998 album, Takes One to Know One. Suddenly, it seems like Donaldson is after the same crowd that devoured St Germain's ""Alabama Blues."" Nothing wrong with that goal, except Donaldson forgot that it took the remixing genius of Todd Edwards to turn ""Alabama Blues"" from stodge to a club necessity. Politely reverbed and chorused indie guitars hallmark ""Innocent,"" Donaldson's pleasingly blatant grasp for some college radio airtime. Shaw responds, ensuring that her lyrics are cappuccino-frothy and easily digestible by the future lawyers and accountants of America. By comparison, the guitars on ""Drifting Off"" could be taken as a tribute to Hüsker Dü, until Donaldson quells them so that Shaw can unveil her passable Debbie Harry impersonation. Eugene Snowden returns for the Oeuvre-ish instrumental ""Asa Nisi Masi,"" and this time, his cowbells and timbales are audible-- until Donaldson's digital percussion overwhelms them. Snowden's also hidden somewhere in the skippy, yuppie-disco mix of ""You Are My Battlestar,"" but again, amidst Donaldson's favored ticky-ticky percussion and delicately two-step bassline, Snowden seems virtually absent. Later, relying on a whammy bar for innovation, Donaldson imbues ""This Time"" with a threat of grit before Shaw's charm-schooled vocals banish the menace. The track is thus reduced to a club song for couples who agonize about which crèche will most benefit their first-born. Invisible Airline closes with ""Dreamland,"" a solo Donaldson performance that showcases his talent for downtempo wallpaper. As it opens, the song shows immense promise. The rhythm track is edgy, almost hinting a glitch-style of programming. The bassline, while never dangerous, certainly snarls in an unpleasant manner. But Donaldson soon vanquishes these unsettling elements so that a tinkly trance piano figure can parade his predictable professionalism. Michael Donaldson doesn't explicitly tell us where his invisible airline travels to, but all the indications are that, rather than making stop-offs in less comfortable, but much more challenging places, Invisible Airline's lone destination is the distant isle of Morcheeba. Seats are always available.","In the three years since the breakbeat downtempo soul of 1998's Feng Shui\n\ was released, Q-Burns Abstract Message ...

It's a Wonderful Life,Sparklehorse,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4fd13d1975652138e42/1:1/w_160/e0c3b632.gif,2001-09-30 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7398-its-a-wonderful-life/,Capitol,"Focus can be a difficult thing to maintain in art. Once you've begun creating something, it's easy to find yourself off on some tangent you never saw coming. It takes a certain amount of discretion, and often, a certain amount of objective distance, to decide which roads to continue down and which ones to abandon. In music, this is, of course, where producers come in. Their job is essentially to stop the artist from getting carried away with a questionable idea and to moderate decisions about direction and material. Past Sparklehorse efforts have been plagued by a certain lack of focus. This doesn't mean they weren't good records-- in fact, 1998's Good Morning Spider was something of a creative triumph, even in spite of its general disorganization. That said, though, hiring an outside producer (not to mention fully ridding himself of all drug habits) seems to have done Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous a great deal of good. Superproducer Dave Fridmann has developed a certain Midas Touch over the years, imbuing nearly every album he works on with a distinctive sonic character, and It's a Wonderful Life has his fingerprints all over it. The most focused Sparklehorse effort yet, the album flows along with the grace of a river occasionally stirred by a rapid or two. The half-songs and quickly squelched ideas of Linkous' past releases are absent in favor of fully fleshed pieces stuffed full of mellotrons, optigans, orchestrons, and sundry humming keyboards. Only once is its flow badly disrupted. (We'll get to that in a second.) The majority of It's a Wonderful Life brims with electro American gothic ballads and fuzzy purees of lo-fi and hi-fi aesthetics. There aren't really any out-and-out rave-ups like ""Pig"" or ""Happy Man,"" but a few of the mid-tempo numbers display enough bite for commercial radio play. (I'm asking too much, aren't I?) ""Gold Day"" snags the ear with a concise melodic hook and some snazzy mellotron flutes. And Linkous' defiantly surrealist approach to lyrics is in full effect here, with all manner of references to smiling babies, organ music, birds, and celestial bodies. In fact, some of the lyrics are so surreal that it's hard to imagine they're even metaphors for anything. When Linkous implores, ""Can you feel the rings of Saturn on your finger?"" in the Vic Chesnutt-cast-adrift-in-a-post-modern-sound-collage number ""Sea of Teeth,"" it's hard to believe that there's much hidden meaning behind it. Animal imagery also abounds; bees, poison frogs, roosters, dogs, doves, and horses all pop up on the first track. How exactly the line, ""I'm full of bees that died at sea,"" proceeds logically to the title refrain of, ""It's a wonderful life,"" is questionable at best, but the claustrophobic mix of optigan, static, chamberlin, and Linkous' plaintive delivery redeems the lyrical content with beautiful production and shimmering instrumentation. The soulful PJ Harvey duet ""Piano Fire"" picks up the energy a bit, proffering lyrical imagery of dusty organs and pianos washing up on beaches, amid a heavily distorted guitar racket and subtly employed electronics. In different places, It's a Wonderful Life conjures recent Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and Grandaddy, all bands who operate in roughly the same headspace as Linkous. The quietly bleeping ""Apple Bed,"" in particular, recalls some of The Sophtware Slump's more elegiac moments. Unfortunately, there's that one aforementioned sore thumb that interrupts the otherwise smooth flow of the album, so allow me to preface my next statement with the following diatribe: I love Tom Waits. His music is rarely short of brilliant on some level, and I've long admired his position as one of the most fearless, innovative, and downright unique songwriters on the planet. The man's craft is his genius personified, and I can't get enough of it. So why does his contribution to It's a Wonderful Life suck so much? ""Dog Door"" is a miserable distraction. Imagine you're floating down a peaceful river on a raft. It's just you, the trees, the birds, and the fish. You don't have a care in the world. Then, suddenly, the violent hillbillies from Deliverance swoop down out of nowhere, pelting you with rocks and shouting an unmemorable phrase over and over again in an annoying, processed falsetto. That is ""Dog Door."" Allow me now to sulk like a denied child. The flow of the album actually picks back up rather easily after ""Dog Door"" finally, mercifully ends, returning to the eerily placid fare that characterizes the rest of the proceedings with ""More Yellow Birds."" Soon after, ""Babies on the Sun"" closes things on a tired, but musically inventive note, with burbling electronics and looped string samples supporting typically cryptic lyrics. It's a Wonderful Life is a strong offering for Sparklehorse, largely shaking off the excesses of past efforts (maddening Tom Waits collaboration aside) in favor of cohesion and structure. The focus unfortunately keeps Linkous from accessing any truly awe-inspiring standout moments like the ones on past records, but the overall result is a lot more rewarding in the long term.","Focus can be a difficult thing to maintain in art.

Sure, you could if you wanted to, but you'd risk being labeled ""weird"" or ""academic"" by your friends, and surely that wouldn't be worth getting exposed to a few, rare specimens of actual ingenuity. No, by manageable, I mean you knew what it was and where to find it. You knew who was making it, and who was just being noisy. Time was, you could pick up a copy of Tempo and get the straight dope on the straightest dope there was: Edgard Varese, Harry Partch, Charles Ives, Igor Stravinsky, John Cage-- all dead, all out there. It was experimental, but it had its place, neatly tucked away in the pages of arcane journals and the minds of ""obscurophiles"" everywhere. Ours is a different world. Not only has the experimental community come to terms with accessibility and shared information, but the world of the living has finally discovered that just because it's new and strange doesn't mean you have to be intimidated. In short, experimental music is more popular than it has ever been. ""Yay,"" right? I mean, when Zappa was inserting subliminal Varese quotes on his LP jackets, no one would have dared dream that one day the French composer might actually outsell old Frank. What harm could a little populism do anyone? I found the answer as a glanced at Thom Yorke's mug on a copy of The Wire a few weeks ago. As if I have to remind you, this mag is sort of a layman's survey of contemporary experimental music-- be it classical, rock, electronic, or jazz. As monthlies go, it's pretty good, but I was pretty shocked to see the main Radio head there. ""Are they experimental now?"" I asked myself. Sort of. ""Did this issue of The Wire sell more than any other in the past year?"" Undoubtedly. And the bittersweet reality of a populist avant-garde almost gave me frostbite. This is the part where John Zorn becomes of use. To the chagrin of indie snobs and New York art-punks, he was running rampant years ago. Zorn often took the piss out of serious classical composition by writing ""game"" pieces, wherein the players jumped through all manner of chutes and ladders as renegade soloists, wild cards and other strategic objects. This is a man who used major label money to record tunes from old Spaghetti Westerns, and had the audacity to attempt to place an image of a decapitated human head on one of his record covers (Elektra, in turn, had the audacity to drop him from their lineup-- public acceptance is a bitch). Musically, Zorn has been through the wringer, and then some. The game pieces comprise most of his early work. He moved from there into the classic ""file card"" compositions like ""Godard"" and ""Spillane,"" and then on to his microcosmic Naked City period. If it hadn't become painfully obvious by then, Zorn's subsequent Semitic jazz project Masada made clear that he was not only interested in furthering the avant-garde tradition, but in integrating it into the shared consciousness of cultural awareness. This was real populism without ever actually making ""popular"" music. So, after you've managed a miracle on par with teaching bears to skate, where do you go? Madness, Love and Mysticism is Zorn playing roots music. That is, after years of forging his own path (albeit one very informed by an interesting mix of influences), he's coming home, into the arms of Grandpa Messiaen and Uncle Cage. ""Le Mômo"" (dedicated to artist Antonin Artaud) might serve nicely as the backdrop to a particularly violent and intellectually manipulative domestic dispute. Pianist Stephen Drury and violinist Jennifer Choi duet to some very intense strains, informed not so much by chamber classical as by clinical schizophrenia. There are some lyrical (but not exactly melodic) sections, though it seems Zorn's calm mode is more ambient/cold than stirring/warm. However, the majority of the piece is quite intense, and since I don't know Artaud's work, I can only guess he was prone to fits of fiery inspiration and/or demonic possession. How's that for an opener? ""Untitled"" (dedicated to artist Joseph Cornell) is a piece for solo cello, performed by frequent Zorn collaborator Erik Friedlander. This piece is much more low key than the first one, though no less flighty. Parts of it flow like an aggressive stream, while others recall Ennio Morricone-style suspense motives. I don't know Cornell's work either (surprise!), but I'm thinking he may have missed out on Artaud's heat seizures. For me, the centerpiece of the album is the last track, ""Amour Fou"" (""Crazy Love""). Zorn has recently put out some sets with dubious bylines such as ""music for lovers"" or ""music for children,"" but the title seems fairly appropriate on this piece. Zorn scores for violin, cello and piano on music that is some of his most evocative, at least in terms of human emotion (as opposed to film score hyperbole). Jealousy and guilt are big players here-- they're detectable in Drury's eerie opening piano chords, and later, his playing of ultra-spooky arpeggios. There are several chaotic interludes, but the overriding feeling is one of nervous indecision, or perhaps detachment between two particularly eclectic lovers. Leave it to a classical composer to take the task of translating the tension of love literally instead of just forming an emo band. Diehard Zorn fans may find this album something of a breath of fresh air, if only to combat his recent stale surf-rock or his long line of Masada-branded products. As his classical compositions go, these are some of the most interesting, and it would seem he's slowly beginning to transcend his influences. For newcomers, the album is probably a better place to start investigating Zorn's chamber works than others like Kristallnacht or Redbird (which could scare away the uninitiated due to hurricane intensity or glacier pace, respectively). Personally, I'm going to art school so I can understand what the hell he's talking about.","There was a time when the avant-garde seemed manageable. I don't mean to say\n\ that it's ever ...

Ultramarin,Jetone,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f313d197565213af8d/1:1/w_160/4a8c8161.jpg,2001-09-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4248-ultramarin/,Force Inc,"The first thing to do when evaluating minimal techno is take the music's temperature. It's incredible to contemplate the variety of emotional reactions possible from nothing more than a 4/4 bass drum, bits of percussive static, and a vague ghost of a melody. Tracks by the likes of Sutekh and Plastikman seem very cold and foreboding to me, suggesting something about the nature of man and machine, and the bleak future in store where the twain do meet. And then there's music made with similar tools by Jan Jelinek (under his own name and as Gramm) and Wolfgang Voigt's Gas releases, music that's warm, organic and expansive, suggesting a cheerful fusion of carbon-based life and silicon. Jetone (Montreal-based Tim Hecker) belongs in the latter category. His tracks are anchored by a bass thump with vast space moving between the sounds, but the slight textures he does incorporate lend the music a cozy and intimate feel. Extreme dub effects in minimal techno can give the illusion of music echoing through an empty concrete structure, but the reverb in Jetone is subtle and gentle, decaying slowly through a soft, welcoming space. ""Phoedra IV"" recalls the frayed loveliness of early Mouse on Mars, in particular Vulvaland's ""Chagrin,"" with its heartbeat pulse, clumps of sonic fuzz, and soothing keyboard drone. Enriching the stew is the slightly psychedelic nature of the sound sources, with portions of ""Phoedra IV"" recalling the drift of EAR's ""Space Themes."" The repeating glitches that sit in the foreground of ""Mtl Bass"" seem related to the guitar refrain that opened Fennesz's Endless Summer, but with an insistent bass pulse pushing the tune away from more abstract realms. And ""Octan"" ups the grooviness factor with some playful electro squelches in the background, coming off as a more austere Two Lone Swordsmen. Throughout most of Ultramarin, Jetone clings to the relaxed 4/4 beat like a tattered shred of a favorite blanket, using the familiar rhythm to bind the unfamiliar and varied sound sources. But a handful of tracks jettison the grid and nestle into pure ambient territory. The finest of these is the brief ""Only Then,"" a glow of static and uncertain pitch that unfolds like a flower greeting the sun. The latter part of Ultramarin finds Jetone getting just a bit colder and darker. The percussion in ""Phoedra II"" sounds like the work of a backhoe, with chunks of crumbling concrete following each heavy blow. ""Untitled"" opts for an edgier palate, with a stern bassline and samples that seem stuck in an infinite loop. ""Fkstrtowr"" replicates the basic ambient format of ""Only Then,"" with harsher, more metallic noise standing in for the affirming hum. And ""Dakkar"" closes the album on its most aggressive note (and, not coincidentally, its most danceable), with electro-tribal percussion and leanings toward house. Still, for the bulk of this fine record, Jetone shows a marked skill in crafting soothing body music as deep as it is wide.","The first thing to do when evaluating minimal techno is take the music's temperature.

Because It Feel Good,Kelly Hogan,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c10213d197565213bb20/1:1/w_160/bb1c5a94.gif,2001-09-27 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3899-because-it-feel-good/,Bloodshot,"I don't know when or how Kelly Hogan became afraid of songwriting. If you asked her, she'd probably say it was never her true calling and was foisted on her by former bandmates and collaborators out of inconsiderate necessity. I could buy that. Singer first, housepainter second, dog owner third, and songwriter fourth (tied with ex-publicist for Bloodshot)-- that's how she'd self-identify, I'd wager. Songwriting to Hogan seems nothing more than a chore, an unhappy exercise that's just a means to an end (the ""end"" being getting to sing it). So, what's the best way to get out of a chore? Anyone with a sibling knows the answer: get someone else to do it. Which is exactly what she's done on her new record. Because It Feel Good is her sophomore solo album, not counting last year's collaboration with the ad hoc Pine Valley Cosmonauts, Beneath the Country Underdog. But perhaps we should count it. This album has a lot more in common with Underdog than it does Kelly's first foray recording under her own name-- 1997's The Whistle Only Dogs Can Hear. A group of stellar musicians, for example, including Andrew Bird on the catgut, Bloodshot session guy Jon Rauhouse, and RockATeens frontman Chris Lopez on loan, handling Futura and organ duties. The other common trait is the lack of Hogan originals versus the hand-picked covers: 80% hand-picked covers to be exact. Contrast that with Whistle where two-thirds of the songs were Hogan or Hogan/Taft compositions and you quickly get the sense that Kelly's heading into Mary Lou Lord territory with her increasing reliance on cover tunes. The two songs Hogan does offer us are among the best on the album. ""No, Bobby Don't"" has a poodle-skirt, 50s doo-wop vibe. Hogan's rich, butter-thick voice teams up with Andrew Bird's light touch on the violin for a very classic, Grease-like moment. Later on, her second track, ""Sugarbowl,"" is the only thing that comes close to sounding like her earlier work: powerful, arching vocals and a playful melody spiked with bittersweet lyrics. The covers are more of a mixed bag and, ultimately, are what prevent this album from being a stronger release. Always known for tossing in a left-field choice or two, Kelly tackles Smog this time. It was nice to hear ""Strayed"" from Dongs of Sevotion filtered through Kelly's comparatively sunny vocal treatment. A weird warping of Charlie Rich's ""Stay"" closes out the album. Heavy-effects organ, pedal steel and a complete lack of percussion brand the song as Hogan's unique interpretation. The result is a nearly a cappella feel, despite the fair amount of instrument being worked over in the background. Yet, while both are nice, neither is necessarily essential. Other covers don't fare so well. Because It Feel Good opens with a singular treatment of the early 70s hit, ""I'll Go To My Grave Loving You."" Other than the novelty of hearing a Statler Brothers song stripped of virtually all of its Statlerness, I don't feel moved at all by a very empathic rendition. Other weak moments abound in song donations and gifts from relative unknowns (Amy Pike is still flying below even the most sophisticated musical radar). And the Randy Newman song near the end of the disc is a slight improvement on a lesser song by the king of cornball piano-pop. But what are we really reviewing here, Hogan's taste or her creativity? Well, due to the nature of the project, both actually. Can Kelly sing? Like no one else on this earth. Paradoxically sultry and angelic, her wonderthroat is tinged with a jazzy-loungy vibe that traces all the way back to her early 90s days with the Jody Grind. Hear it once and you'll never mistake it again. The disc is worthy of some attention just because it's another rare moment when her swoon-inducing voice is put to plastic. Can she pick good songs to cover? Once upon a time, yes, but not so reliably here. A few of the tracks were interesting to hear recast-- ""Strayed,"" King Floyd's ""Please Don't Leave Me Lonely""-- but at least an equal number were unwelcome guests. I could have accepted an EP-- one that was that much lighter and leaner for having jettisoned the Randy Newman and Statler Brothers at the minimum. Can she overcome her reluctance to pick up the pen and write with the kind of self-confidence that will allow her to start churning out albums instead of ""projects"" or ""collaborations?"" I don't know, but it sure would be nice.","I don't know when or how Kelly Hogan became afraid of songwriting. If you asked her, she'd probably ...

Hello Is Anyone Out There,Mr. Wright,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f813d197565213be50/1:1/w_160/a21600e0.gif,2001-09-27 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5483-hello-is-anyone-out-there/,Le Grand Magistery,"I've needed some soft sounds lately. Anything too aggro starts to churn my guts and gives me a tummyache. Mr. Wright is a soothing substance, sliding into my ear canals and down to my esophagus, coating my stomach. (Okay, that's gross.) Some of it splashes into my brain, numbing the back of my head. Though, that numbness could be due to me lying in the bathtub for going on about three hours now. My spine has become one with the imitation porcelain. Yes, Kevin Wright makes ideal music for falling asleep to in the bathtub. (Warning to impressionable young minds: do not fall asleep in the tub. Didn't you see Nightmare on Elm Street? On another topic, why don't horror movies have monsters anymore? Why is it all riddles and helping the ghosts? Helping ghosts isn't scary. Before we leave these parentheses, let me remind you that the subject is Mr. Wright's music and falling asleep in the tub.) As the water bobs, I imagine the waves of the sea. See, the ocean is a repeated theme on this album. Mr. Wright is a sailor, free, as he asserts on Hello Is Anyone Out There's opening track, ""Sailor on the Sea. He lives on ""Ocean Boulevard."" His lover lives by the sea, as we learn on ""Darling Honey,"" a song about loving and knowing someone without knowing her name. This track, with its lilting verses and gently lifting (sounds like a brassiere, but it isn't) accordion phrase, stays in my head, tranquilizing me. The Mr. Wright sound is simple and homogeneous throughout the record. An acoustic guitar strums basic chords, a keyboard blows like a zephyr, the drummer strokes the drums with his brushes, and Kevin Wright croons like the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon. Wright avoids Hannon's histrionics, which could make him more palatable, but sometimes he's restrained to a fault. There are moments when the music gently surges and Wright sounds like he has the range to go for a high note, but instead sinks back into his wry, almost spoken baritone. Maybe he can't go anywhere else. Another problem plaguing Is There Anyone Out There is its sameness. The tunes are smartly written, but they all stick with similar sounds and emotions. You want him to branch out-- hell, even do a bouncy showtune or something like Scott Walker sometimes launches into. Even the nice electric piano solo on ""Ocean Boulevard"" can't keep the song from slips beneath the gentle lapping waves. On a sad note, as I was trying to dig up some information on this guy, I typed Is There Anyone Out There into a search engine. I came up with 186,000 entries, none having to do with Mr. Wright. Keep looking, people.","I've needed some soft sounds lately. Anything too aggro starts to churn my guts and gives me a tummyache ...

Supermogadon,Marumari,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c213d197565213bdde/1:1/w_160/3bc89b31.jpeg,2001-09-27 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5125-supermogadon/,Carpark,"To this day, technology still has yet to approach an accurate approximation of nature. High-end CGI animations may elicit ""ooh's"" and ""aah's"" from us now, but in a few years, we're going to look back at something like the Final Fantasy movie and just laugh, the same way we currently laugh at an outdated special effects extravaganza like King Kong. Still, there's something oddly cool and impressive about a movie like King Kong, or even a more recent laughable special effects wankathon like Starship Troopers. It seems to be woven into the fabric of the human mind to be impressed, or at least entertained, by any kind of artificial reality that is at all analogous to our own. This principle extends perfectly into the realm of electronic music, where the quest for new and interesting sounds and the quest to electronically emulate organic sounds intermingle with concurrently fascinating and wildly entertaining results. Good electronic music provides the excitement of hearing a sound that you've possibly never heard before, and the fun of being able to try to figure out what that sound's sources was. Supermogadon, the latest album from Josh Presseisen under his Marumari alias, wonderfully captures the intriguing synthetic façade of sci-fi. But whereas its predecessor, The Wolves Hollow, was oftentimes outright cheesy and cartoonish, Supermogadon is much more subtle and subdued. The Wolves Hollow drew its inspiration from a fictitious story of Plutonian wolves and cow brains; Supermogadon draws its inspiration from Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, converting chapter titles to song titles and co-opting cover art. Like The Wolves Hollow before it, Supermogadon takes a wonderfully warped approach to the futuristically fake. Barely audible vocal tracks are buried beneath drum machine beats and bubbly synthesizers. ""Indigo Florist,"" the album's standout track, layers synthesized bells with staticky drum machines and bouncy bass synthesizer. The song retains a relatively constant feel as new elements are added and removed, making for a subtle, gradual development. Sure, it doesn't necessarily reach through your headphones into your ears and violently shake its contents like a British nanny, but it certainly captivates when given proper attention. Another highlight comes with ""The Mutated Wisdom,"" a song that harbors many more twists and turns than most of the tracks on Supermogadon. A dissonant chorus of voice-like keyboards, a popping IDM beat, and sine wave synthesizers construct a clearly-defined rhythmic and melodic skeleton. Digitally manipulated squeaks scurry over the song like extraterrestrial rodents as a smooth drum machine beat shifts the track's rhythmic focus. At the end, everything fades out except for a distant echo of a synthesizer, which also quickly disappears. Indeed, distance seems to be a sonic theme of Supermogadon. Most of the melodies on the album are obscured and faded-- a drop in aural resolution that causes many of the sounds on the album to bleed together into a far-off, semi-terrestrial sonic landscape. Occasionally, the very prominent drum machines seem a bit forced or obvious, only distracting from the intricacy of the more obscured melodic workings. Rather than making the subtle sounds seem more accessible, oftentimes the drum machine beats on Supermogadon have the opposite effect, contrasting the other sounds too harshly to let them shine through. I'll concede that I've never read The Martian Chronicles. Nor have I seen the 1980 USA Miniseries adaptation with Bernadette Peters and Rock Hudson. But from what I've heard of Bradbury's classic, the sense of obscured unreality found on Supermogadon makes perfect sense. Using music instead of language, Pressiesen can convey this feeling in an instant, rather than fifty pages. Like a book, though, Supermogadon demands a significant portion of your attention to be fully appreciated.","To this day, technology still has yet to approach an accurate approximation of\n\ nature.

The Luxury Leader,Explosion Robinson,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd213d197565213b3de/1:1/w_160/0115623c.gif,2001-09-27 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2877-the-luxury-leader/,Slabco,"Pitchfork contributor Melissa Witkowski recently referred to Iceland's Múm as ""twee electronica, the Belle & Sebastian of IDM."" A perfect description. But before twee electronica, there was twee trip-hop, and the great Los Angeles-based Slabco label's roster boasted the undisputed champions of the genre. Some of the early Sukpatch cassettes-- recorded when they still had a girl singing lead-- feature the most childlike Mo Tucker-style ballads sung atop samples of menacing rap loops, an absolutely killer combination that I've never heard done as well since. As suburban kids raised on the music, Sukpatch, Land of the Loops and Volume All-Star were among the first to hear something warm, nostalgic and a little sad in the hip-hop break. Explosion Robinson is a one-man project by Steve Herman, who did time as a member of Sukpatch. And if you're familiar with that band, you probably have a good idea as to what Explosion Robinson sounds like: light instrumental hip-hop pieced together with well-crafted beats, plenty of Moog, bits of scratching, and samples galore. It's a familiar formula for long-time Slabco diehards such as myself, and Explosion Robinson executes it with style. Still, after Dynomite D and Draco offered new takes on the Slabco sound last year, this album suffers a bit for being such a retread. ""Down Home"" opens the album with a vocodered voice saying, ""Prepare to activate,"" instantly leading me to believe I'd grabbed the nearby Emperor Penguin CD from my collection by mistake. But then the beats fold in, and I knew I was miles away from those stiff (if charming) Chicagoans. ""Gold Chain"" has some greasy wah-wah Moog work, a nice laidback Dre-inspired cut for chillin' that also has a tendency to just lie there without ever grabbing the listener by the collar. ""Work It, Bitch"" cops a new wave vibe, with a self-consciously herky-jerky synth refrain, a rare scene from Gary Numan's happy childhood. The Luxury Leader's grooves are what save it from complete blandness. In addition to their melodic sense, the beat construction was always Sukpatch's ace in the hole. Though the songs were and are numbingly repetitive (in the best possible way), Sukpatch's beats had a real swing to them, vaguely connected in my mind to the jazzy production of Native Tongues-era hip-hop. Explosion Robinson comes close to matching this rhythmic verve, but the songs consistently fall just short of being catchy. Something's missing: voices. ""Glass Packs"" is the perfect example of a nice backing track crying out for some foreground. It's got a solid bass riff, punchy drums and ear-catching sampled refrains, but could use either a melody or some rapping out front to give it focus. The Luxury Leader seems like an decent sketch for what could have been an excellent album.","Pitchfork contributor Melissa Witkowski recently referred to Iceland's\n\ M\xF9m as ""twee electronica, the Belle & Sebastian of IDM ...

Hammers and Anvils,Graeme Downes,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba06c0084474cd0c2745/1:1/w_160/05fd5794.gif,2001-09-26 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2434-hammers-and-anvils/,Matador,"The title of this album might conjure images of a blacksmith plying his trade: pulling metal from a seething furnace and banging it into a useful shape. But as with any trade, the mark of a true craftsman is the ability to make the difficult seem effortless. In this light, Graeme Downes can be considered a craftsman as well. For Downes, his furnace is a piano and the sheet music scattered across his floor like dying sparks. We imagine Downes with a pencil wedged behind his ear, working diligently on song after song, trying to perfectly place each note on the pages. Over the course of fifteen years and six albums, Downes managed this impossible task with his old band, the Verlaines. Now, with Hammers & Anvils, he crafts these songs only for himself. Out of all the Flying Nun Records alumni (including more influential groups like Tall Dwarfs, the Chills, and the Clean), the Verlaines were the most regal and refined. Sure, the songs would march along in that strum-happy fashion that became synonymous with the New Zealand underground, but then a string section or a vocal chorus would enter the fray, taking the song in an unexpected, wonderful direction. The best Verlaines songs combined Downes' two capital music influences: his academic musical studies (formerly a student of classical music, he's now a lecturer at New Zealand's Otago University), and his rock music roots. Regardless of whether the songs featured distorted guitars or oboes and clarinets, Downes' lyrical romanticism remained constant and fervent. Comparisons could be made between the Verlaines and the Wedding Present, but where David Gedge seethed and raged, Graeme Downes would sigh and swoon, even at his most frenzied. Hammers and Anvils isn't much different from his Verlaines output, except for its lack of grandeur, which is easily explained by the fact that Graeme played all the instruments here (which include guitar, piano, trumpet, and clarinet) and co-produced the record. The milieus presented range from just Downes and his guitar (on the opening title track) to a full-band arrangement with a digital orchestral backing (on ""Rock and Roll Hero""). Though there are a few aggressive, rockier numbers (like the band-like ""Alright by Me"" and ""Cattle, Cars, and Chainsaws""), these are the exception. The solitary nature of this album is best exemplified in its quieter moments, like the piano balladry of ""Mastercontrol,"" or the Tin Pan Alley saunter of ""Cole Porter"" and ""Getting Out of It."" Not surprisingly, it's in these quieter songs that Graeme's wary romanticism is best expressed-- in ""Cole Porter,"" he confesses to be ""like Fred Astaire with concrete in my shoes,"" while the ethereal ""Shoreleave"" offers a different sort of confession: ""I'd trade the world and all its storms for four walls in your arms."" In some ways, Hammers and Anvils may be the most accomplished album of Downes' career. The range exhibited throughout these thirteen tracks shows the mind of a truly skilled craftsman at the top of his game. If there's a criticism that can be leveled at craftsmen, though, it's the fear of one's mastery overwhelming the desire that originally led them to pursue that craft. In this instance, there's no need to worry of such loss. But why take it from me, when Graeme says it himself: Now don't try explaining
Why no love can change me

I gotta dive down to find them","The title of this album might conjure images of a blacksmith plying his trade: pulling metal from a seething furnace ...

Hard Again,Scott Tuma,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a829b1335d7bf1699202/1:1/w_160/28232429.gif,2001-09-26 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8183-hard-again/,AtavisticTruckstop,"Souled American got the proverbial shaft. It's a well-known story, but one that bears repeating. Forming in Chicago in the late 80s, the band released four remarkable albums of howling roots-rock deconstruction before losing their stateside distribution when Rough Trade's American division went belly up. Anachronistic and difficult to classify, these four albums-- Fe, Flubber, Around the Horn, and Sonny (now back in print on tUMULt Records)-- were largely ignored at the time of their release, and the situation was not helped by infrequent touring and a lack of press savvy. More recently, the band has toiled in near obscurity, releasing two albums on German labels since the mid-90s. In the end, though, Souled American was probably just too arty for a genre that puts such a high value on ""authenticity."" Fortunately, the band seems to prefer its cult status. Of course, it's hard not thinking about what might have been. The more or less contemporaneous Uncle Tupelo (which eventually split into Wilco and Son Volt) was handed the alt-country banner and basked in the spotlight while Souled American quietly pursued their craft in the darkness. ""No Depression""-- the movement and the accompanying magazine-- could have just as easily been called ""Feel Better"" (the final track on Fe), if given a slightly different set of circumstances. Now, more than a decade after that first Souled American album, the alt-country ""movement"" has become more of a twitch. Hype, always a fickle mistress, has left the No Depression magazine cold, and it's cheating heart has moved on to other lovers. For a while it was Britpop, then a drunken orgy with countless electronic artists, then a debauched evening with post-rock before moving on again. Souled American's guitarist Scott Tuma decided to move on as well, parting with the band amicably after the 1996 release of Notes Campfire. Judging from the all-instrumental Hard Again, his first solo album, Tuma just wanted to move away from traditional song structure. Taking a more expressionistic approach-- using multi-generation guitar loops, organ drones, skittish percussion, and banjo so far removed from ""fiery bluegrass breakdowns"" that it almost sounds like traditional Japanese Koto music-- Hard Again sees Tuma teaming up with Dirty Three percussionist Jim White and Michael Krassner of the Boxhead Ensemble, two groups with which he shares an aural affinity. Opening with the cold and distant ""Beautiful Dreamer,"" Tuma eases you into the sound of Hard Again as if easing you into icy water-- that is, very, very slowly-- deliberately setting one guitar tone against another in an almost painterly fashion. And like many tracks on Hard Again, the song ends abruptly, suggesting it was born out of longer improvisational sessions. ""March"" begins similarly, but builds to a thicker texture reminiscent of Robert Fripp and Brian Eno's collaborations, while the aptly titled ""JimWhite Drums"" swirls droning guitar over what sounds like a sped up tape of Jim White assembling a drum kit rather than playing it. The title cut is the most song-oriented track here, with a definite beginning, middle, and end. But ""Sermon,"" the closing song, best sums up the album's mood: meditative and austere, but majestic, as an otherworldly organ echoes through what sounds like a long-abandoned cathedral. Anyone familiar with the latter-day, slow-as-molasses Souled American albums will see Hard Again as a natural extension, or at least as an abstract interpretation of where that band was heading. Fans of the above mentioned Dirty Three and Boxhead Ensemble-- as well as David Pajo or even Neil Young's Dead Man soundtrack-- will find solace within these ethereal sounds.","Souled American got the proverbial shaft.

Mensa Dance Squad,Lesser,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce85e6ef95969322f48/1:1/w_160/fa018140.gif,2001-09-26 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4753-mensa-dance-squad/,Tigerbeat6,"To the outsider, music may seem like a lazy calling: release roughly 60 minutes of music every two years; make the requisite live appearances; then rest on your laurels collecting royalties, tipping martinis and lighting your blunts with flaming Benjamins. Seriously, how much work could it take to piece together an album? Most electronic artists release only a fraction of what they produce. Just as a painter might draft sheafs of studies and sketches before approaching her canvas, a musician might discard hundreds of samples and dozens of mixes before stamping his seal on a song. And for every track that makes the grade for release, there are often several that never see the light of day. Behind the best songs lie days-- if not weeks-- of sweat, toil and self-censorship. Regrettably, you won't find many of these songs on Mensa Dance Squad. The calling card of performers like Wesley Willis and the Shaggs is their unrefined, unpracticed, so-bad-it's-brilliant sound. Fair enough. But this gimmick could never translate into the world of IDM, where every glitch is deliberately laid and every beat extensively mapped, where accidents are planned and precision is key. When electronic music comes across as underdeveloped or unduly sloppy, I consider it a fault, not a virtue. Most of Lesser's one- or two-minute noodlings on Mensa Dance Squad strike me as jejune experiments, rough sketches in an artist's notebook, or unmolded ideas never brought to fruition. The songs-- few of them actually worthy of that description-- seldom rise to the bar set by Lesser's previous efforts or the rest of the Tigerbeat6 catalog. A few diamonds sparkle up from the rough-- all of them longer pieces that hazard some attempt at structure and take time to elaborate on their themes. ""Mensa Dunce Squad (Leg Up Program),"" offsets the manic attention span of Lesser's percussive cannonade with soft melodic motifs, whose recurrence brings a sense of cohesion to the song. Credit for the album's standout actually goes to Kid606, whose nine-minute ""Don't Techno for Answer"" remix closes the album by rehashing samples from the entire record. The Kid's contribution outdoes Lesser at his own game with a brilliant ADDDM montage that evolves from raga-rooted drill-n-bass into passages of cavernous ambience and cacophonous fury. The tune comes to rest on a tranquil synth refrain, immaculately punctuated by quirky beats and a disembodied but intangibly resonant vocal sample: ""Once again, ladies and gentlemen."" And then the disc whirs to a stop. The first five tracks on Mensa Dance Squad range in length from just over a minute to just under three minutes, and juggle sounds from the same basic sample kits. ""Mensa Dance Squad,"" ""Ensam Dance Squad,"" ""Nsame Dance Squad,"" ""Samen Dance Squad"" and ""Amens Dance Squad"" were clearly intended as variations on the same theme. Unfortunately, it's difficult to discern any continuity between the tracks, and none of them stand alone as songs. They're really just units of sound-- kernels from which songs might bloom, but never do. And given so little time to evolve, none of these sonic experiments ever pan out. Instead, they build up riffs that never mature, and propose ideas without examining their nuances. ""Samen Dance Squad"" entices the listener with a menacing, low-register drone and a dizzying mix of time-spaced harmonic oscillations, but abruptly vanishes at the 1:12 mark, segueing into the fifth track. Gearhound, the album Lesser released on Matador earlier this year, showcased him in better form. On that album, he drew out the individual songs, meditating on structure and conceding sparse melodic flourishes. Nothing he has to offer on Mensa Dance Squad rivals the idiosyncratic, surreal tones of Gearhound's ""Obligatory Glitch Worship"" or the slow-mounting staccato onslaught of ""Hindu Shuffle and Force."" With Mensa Dance Squad, Lesser seems to be thinking out loud, haphazardly attacking the canvas before penciling a single sketch. Meanwhile, we're left with the uncensored results of his efforts: a few tantalizing soundbytes that hardly warrant a $12 purchase.","To the outsider, music may seem like a lazy calling: release roughly 60 minutes of music every two years; make ...

Tools in the Dryer,Lambchop,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc86abf31b7dc7155d3a/1:1/w_160/23dc5a7e.gif,2001-09-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4655-tools-in-the-dryer/,Merge,"What the hell are Lambchop, anyway? They're not quite indie rock, they're not quite soul, and they're not really country. Call them an alt-country band and you're liable to be the unfortunate recipient of a fourteen-against-one all-out beating. Their influences seem to come from all over the map, resulting in an eclectic and thoroughly fucked up amalgamation of country, soul, fuzzy lo-fi, classical music, 70s AM, outright noise, and mumbled Appalachian folk. Tools in the Dryer, Lambchop's very own odds and sods collection, comes 14 years after the band made their first rudimentary recordings as Posterchild. Of course, it doesn't really provide any more insight into what they are, exactly, but it does offer a wide-ranging glimpse of Lambchop's career trajectory-- from their lo-fi bedroom days as a trio in 1987 to the 14-piece line-up that played England's Queen Elizabeth Hall in 2000, backed by an eight-piece string section. Sequenced in random order, and bookended by the A and B sides from their first Merge Records seven-inch, Tools in the Dryer is perhaps best reviewed by breaking it into logical categories. Category 1: Remixes:
Tools in the Dryer contains three Lambchop remixes, conveniently lumped together as tracks 11-13. Unrest's Mark Robinson gives up an abstract, beatless mix of ""The Militant"" off How I Quit Smoking, and it's the best of the three, deconstructing pieces of the original and adding organ interludes and string swells to create a sparse soundscape. Zero 7's smooth funk remix of Nixon's ""Up with People"" removes the lead vocals from the original, leaving only the gospel-inspired backing vocals for a decent R&B; throwback. The Doppelganger remix of the band's cover of Curtis Mayfield's ""Give Me Your Love"" (from 1998's What Another Man Spills) is least successful, neutering the deep, throbbing bass groove that made the band's own version so ridiculously sexual, in favor of generic dance grooves. It also unfortunately thrusts frontman Kurt Wagner's annoying falsetto to the front of the mix, which can grate a bit on the nerves if you're not prepared for it. Category 2: Demos:
Ah, demos. Is there any finer insight into a band's creative process? Two of the three demos included here are culled from 90-minute tapes that Lambchop recorded as a three-piece in 1987, in bassist Marc Trovillion's bedroom. They band recorded the tracks on primitive equipment with a microphone taped to a push broom, and named the resulting opuses things like ""I'm Fucking Your Daughter."" They were still called Posterchild at the time (at some point, the Poster Children's lawyer told them they'd better change their name, so after rejecting R.E.N. and Turd Goes Back, they settled on Lambchop), and the results of these sessions are about as unmarketable as anything you've heard. The crust on ""All Over the World,"" with its cheeky countoff and horrifyingly out-of-tune recorders, is so thick that you'd think it came off a wax cylinder. And its companion, ""Style Monkeys,"" doesn't sound a hell of lot better. It's propelled by a crummy drum machine and features Kurt Wagner's banshee caterwauling way up in front again. The third demo is much more recent, recorded in Wagner's living room in 1992. ""Each with a Bag of Fries"" is actually mostly coherent, and the buzzing of the bass amp in the background is more endearing than annoying. It certainly doesn't hurt that it's not a bad song, either. Category 3: Live tracks:
The band offers only two live recordings on Tools in the Dryer, culled from drastically different periods in their evolution. Though extremely lo-fi, the 1990 recording of the strangely Lou Reed-ish ""Flowers of Memory"" (performed at a now-defunct vegetarian cafe in Nashville) still exposes the song for the good composition that it is. Meanwhile, ""Love TKO"" is drawn from the aforementioned Queen Elizabeth Hall show on their 2000 UK tour, during which they were supporting their highly polished Nixon album. The track possesses an infectious energy that was sadly missing from Nixon itself, and it's nice to hear that the band, in their maturity, hasn't become completely wrapped up in Steely Dan studio perfectionism. Category 4: A-sides, b-sides, and compilation tracks:
This is the largest category, and also the one that makes Tools in the Dryer worth purchasing for non-diehards. The compilation opener, ""Nine,"" comes bursting out of the gate with harmonized scatting and a typically subdued Kurt Wagner melody. Bill Killebrew's guitar unleashes an avalanche of Pavement-inspired riffs and noise as the band combines doo-wop with slacker rock for a truly unique recording. ""Cigaretiquette"" emphasizes the band's soul roots, opening with a chord progression and feel that's reminiscent of, of all things, Tommy James' ""Crystal Blue Persuasion."" The band's brilliant, moody take on Vic Chesnutt's ""Miss Prissy"" follows, sucking countrified steel guitar out of its natural element and placing it into a dark, brooding folk march. Wagner's limited vocals do their best to carry the melody as someone strums piano strings or an autoharp (it's hard to tell, really) in the background. ""The Petrified Florist (alternate take)"" is an appropriately icy, piano-driven dirge, which clarinetist/saxophonist Jonathan Marx claims, in his generous liner notes, is one of the most difficult recordings the band ever made. The remaining songs from this category run the gamut from brisk indie rock (""Scared Out of My Shoes"") to ramshackle noise-folk (""Or Thousands of Prizes"") to brooding, mumbly, music box-inflected shoegazer country (""Moody Fucker""). The Conclusion (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Avoid Smooth Segues):
Tools in the Dryer presents an excellent opportunity for fans of Lambchop to get a hold of some of the band's rarest tracks, including a few that rank among their best. And, for better or for worse, it also gives you a sneak peak at their embarrassing awkward stage, before they had the money or the backing to enter a real studio. Tack on a few throw-away remixes and two worthwhile live tracks, and you've got yourself a deal. It won't convert any new fans, but those already in the know may want to get in on this.","What the hell are Lambchop, anyway? They're not quite indie rock, they're not quite soul, and they're ...

Faust/So Far,Faust,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a165ea9e61561daa47b5/1:1/w_160/5b46e7f4.jpg,2001-09-25 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11738-faustso-far/,Collector's ChoiceCollector's Choice,"Ah, Germany in springtime. The leaves have returned, and the air is cool and of noble weightlessness. You can clearly see what the past has left behind in the medieval town squares, and hear the music of Bach's day playing continually from the opera houses and churches. Germans, like most of us, enjoy admiring nature. And since their cities have many parkland areas, it's no surprise to find the tourists crowding shops while the locals gaze in an auburn splendor. This is a country of quaint Bavarian villages and major metropolitan centers, majestic mountains and beautiful waterways, castles and culture. So, wouldn't it be nice if we dropped some acid, holed up like trolls and made an album? Faust's records have never been the kind you dissect. The band seems to have some kind of plan at work, but not the type of plan left for others to follow. It's not the kind of algorithm that bears any scrutiny; yet, 30 years later, the music remains. And given the state of the boys in der Gruppe, that alone makes it worthy of reissue. After spending several months in 1970-71 lazing, smoking, and existing rather superfluously (on Virgin Records' dime, of course), Faust moved their commune to Wümme in western Germany and decided to get serious. By serious, I mean they decided to put to tape the sugarplum visions in their heads. By sugarplum visions, I mean the acid-damaged prototypes of the New Solution for Music. By music, I mean their self-titled 1971 debut album and its contents, which consist of the music they played and processed using Kurt Graupner's infamous little black boxes. And by Kurt Graupner, I mean Faust's engineer, the sound wave savior who, perhaps more than any other, was responsible for bringing the group's adventures in hi-fi to acetate. ""Why Don't You Eat Carrots?"" gets the movement underway with a knall (""bang,"" my kliene Kinder). Actually, it's more like the wake of a small jet whose engine roar is panned out all over your speakers. In the jet's cockpit, we have ""All You Need is Love"" and ""Satisfaction"" blaring, if only to remind you that Faust were at one time human and listening to your music. Upon reaching an altitude of about 120 decibels, our captains decide to let the aerodynamic vehicle coast, dropping a vaguely Bill Evans-esque piano interlude before launching a vaguely Zappa-esque groove that features some vague kind of shinai solo (or maybe one of their homemade synthesizers). I wish I could translate the sheer romantic terror of the thing, but it's all rather vague. ""Meadow Meal"" follows, and though the intensity has died down a bit, Faust still resides in the hall of mirrors. There doesn't seem to be much reason behind the stuff (other than the ""wonderful wooden"" variety), and though the by-product may be skewed art-pop along the lines of Throbbing Gristle or Nurse with Wound, the overwhelming vibe here is of playful curiosity rather than oppressive abstraction. After a mystical incantation (""And the guess I get it/ And the gate I get it/ And the game I get it""), they break into a trashy rock joint, shimmying like Monkees on parade. I suppose they couldn't have kept it down if they'd tried. And that ends the program as Faust planned it: a total of about 18 minutes of music before running out of steam and/or money. What to do, then, but jam out the mother of all documented freak-outs. ""Miss Fortune"" is probably not Faust's greatest legacy, but it is a testament to some fairly unadulterated haze-charisma. Recorded live, it consists of two rock-esque instrumentals (again filtered through Graupner's little black boxes), and one fantastic piece of prose set to a ghostly backdrop of acoustic guitar and admirably understated shakers. ""And at the end, realize that nobody knows if it really happened."" And at the end, I say ""amen."" Faust wasn't a hit by any stretch, but it was freakish enough to garner a cult following. So, with a small sect of the world waiting, the band retreated to Wümme again, presumably with the intention of making an album that you could at least play while sober. That album would turn out to be So Far, their 1972 sophomore release, and the record with which the press (or whomever it was covering them at the time-- probably just the NME's Ian MacDonald) caught up. Within seconds, the change is obvious. The steady tom toms and insistent rhythm guitar of ""It's a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl"" aren't the work of the voodoo shamans on the last album-- or maybe they are, but under pressure, perhaps Faust just betray their VU roots more readily (and simultaneously earn their Krautrock merit badge). But where there had been chaos, there was now tranquility; where there had grown paranoia and Dadaism, suddenly there sprouted mystique and atmosphere. A good start, but stay tuned. After ""On the Way to Abamäe,"" we're given signs that all is not well in the Faust camp. ""No Harm"" begins with a drawn-out crescendo that leads into a horn-driven instrumental. That's about as much as I can say about it. It's sort of indistinct, but in the context of the album, and coming from this band, it seems either very campy and strange, or oddly comfortable. In any case, the feeling doesn't last long, as three minutes in, the tune transforms into feverish blues-rock, with the phrase, ""Daddy take the banana, tomorrow is Sunday,"" repeated ad nauseam. You know Faust, right? The funny part about Faust was, no matter how far out they got, they always came back. And on the title track, they trade in their acid wisdom for pure Kraut trance groove-- though very different from Can's avant-funk or Neu's motorik beat-- via horn punches and a galloping rhythm. And, like clockwork, just when you think they've managed the whole acid situation, ""Mamie"" introduces the buzzsaw of doom, replete with an intimidating synth force field and Moog vomit. Then, the chanting returns. The chanting! It's like some kind of game that only the Boredoms have figured out how to play since. I could tell you that the next song goes back to sounding halfway normal (you know, that ""kids in a dark studio with bipolar musos to the tune of a DeVry commercial"" kind of normal), and that the last track tells you how many toes and ears you have, but you get the picture. It also asks, ""I wonder how long this is gonna last?"" and if I didn't know it lasted two or three more years, I'd say about ten minutes. In the end, history and I were wrong, because both of these albums have outrun all the detox statistics by maintaining a permanent place in the hearts of seemingly normal people everywhere. Okay, so it's probably mostly greasy lo-fi musicians and acidheads, but there are times when it doesn't pay to know the difference.",,9.0,
H.O.M.E.S.,Original Brothers and Sisters of Love,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0013d197565213afab/1:1/w_160/1eaf19d3.gif,2001-09-25 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6038-homes/,Telegraph Company,"Every band's either got good vibrations or doomy melodrama. In the era to come, is there a place for either? How much will music change? What will step up to replace the cracked glaze of teen pop? Personally, I'm calling on everyone to rally around the White Stripes for a definitive change. But with my manifesto for such stripped-down blues-rock in hand, how can I pretend to care much for another clever band with a flair for arrangement singing their hymns to summers past? The answer, of course, is that variety is the spice of life. But if the truth must be told, I really can't get that excited about them, despite the fact that they do create very pleasant, modern sea chanteys for Sunday afternoons. The Original Brothers and Sisters of Love have a taste for Brian Wilson, the Kinks, minstrel music, and the sea-- or rather, the great lakes of their Michigan home, which are referenced repeatedly throughout H.O.M.E.S (and whose names create the mnemonic acronym that is the album's title). The band consists of three gifted songwriters (as well as three other instrumentalists) who sing with spirit and finesse in affected growling brogues and sweet, clean falsettos. Greg McIntock sings only two of the album's songs, but brings home the trophy of ""finest vocal performance"" for the slow piano ballad ""Silent Apologies."" His voice uncurls from a lazing Ray Davies croon into a raspy, aching groan before lifting to a mournful cry. Jamie Monger writes and sings the jauntiest numbers, which at times sound quite a bit like the Waterboys, while his brother Tim dips further into sweet, breathy ballads cluttered with more mementos of past days than a grandmother's attic. It's awful nostalgic, this record. There's a Tim Monger ode to a vintage Schwinn and another to Tigers Stadium, and several references to childhood and forgotten other things. And all these sepia-toned images are lent strength by the gentle poetry of the lyrics, and the light, front-porch swing of the acoustic guitars, banjos, mandolins and strings. The violin of Liz Auchinvole (on loan to Michigan from New Zealand) is featured often, but it's the almost tuba-like sound of Scott McIntlock's bass triplets that anchors these sailors somewhere out on Lake Huron in a fictional past, in a world that ""was founded when the world was young."" As Jamie Monger sings on ""East Jesus America"": It was passed down from moon to sun
And it's miles away from Motown
But when the stars shine drunk with summer
Hold back the hair of your lover
Yeah, it just breaks my heart just being there, it's true It's nice stuff, yeah. Very pretty, and capable of earnestness without always falling victim to saccharine clichés. The band's genuine affection for the music of the past is endearing. But I wonder: what will the future bring?","Every band's either got good vibrations or doomy melodrama.

Iran,Iran,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b980eb335119a49ec7bf/1:1/w_160/7efc61b3.jpeg,2001-09-25 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4123-iran/,Tumult,"Iran has the dubious distinction of an unsavory name in less than felicitous times. No doubt, when the band adopted its moniker, Iran-- the fundamentalist Shiite Muslim nation who brought you the 1979 fall of the Shah, the taking of 52 American hostages and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie-- was well on its way to taking its place next to King George and Khruschchev in the dustbin of America's bogeymen. These days, however, with the U.S. standing drinks in the rogues' gallery of the new world order, the name is no longer quite so remote, nor quite so innocuous. But none of this even amounts to a coincidence, as Iran released their debut long before the recent national events; truth be told, Iran's album just celebrated its first birthday. Before this gets chalked up to Pitchfork's much-maligned tardiness, however, let me submit, in our defense, the fact that the headbangers at Tumult Records would sooner push Pitchfork into the girl's bathroom than send us the choice fruits of their gloom-and-doom-laden catalog. Nevertheless, we would brook no interference in getting our mitts on this noise-pop masterpiece, come hell or high water. Besides, what's twelve months in the procurement of unabashed excellence? Despite the hostile connotations of Iran's name, this San Francisco five-piece is as American as snap, crackle and pop-- which presents as accurate a description of their sound as any. The militantly lo-fi Iran seem more temperamentally aligned with the electronic progenitors of the glitch revolution than with the no wave-isms of their likely influences (DNA and early Sonic Youth). The crackling buzz and scuzz in which Iran's sludge-pop is hopelessly encrusted seems bent on repeating the question that stands at the heart of all glitch: what's the musical difference between function and malfunction? The answer, as always, is: none. The hissing amp and wheezing microphone can perform the same aural magic as their pristine and sound-checked counterparts. Let Granddaddy lament the broken appliances; Iran has picked them up and made something damaged but nonetheless wonderful. The tribal bongos, chiming bells and serpentine guitars of ""Yellow Lemon Tigers"" scream like a manifesto for the entire album: a skittering squall in the place of a formal introduction. But ""Tigers"" slips easily into the jagged jangle of ""Pick Up/Stillborn,"" a dirty pop gem of fierce drums and thick, distorted guitars. ""Pick Up/Stillborn"" approaches Slanted and Enchanted-era Pavement in its deadpan vocals and accidental but undeniable hooks, chugging sloppily along while the alien synths and rattling guitars bend their pitches maliciously in and out of tune. You're still whistling its fragile melody long after the tune has dissolved into the hearing-test tone poem introduction to ""Dream Summer,"" a densely layered blast of tape-looped noise, beneath which lies the surreptitious strum and sweet folk reflection that constitutes the album's secret joy. Beneath the din, Iran is an often catchy and always well-crafted folk-rock record, disguised by amplification as ""serious music."" Nothing supports this claim as convincingly as the meditative ""The Music Plays Itself,"" where limpid guitars reverberate mournfully over railroad noise and faded electronic scratch. The song sounds about as a delicate as a funeral in the middle of Penn Station: solace ever in danger of fatal distraction, and ultimately undone. The gorgeous wooden acoustics of ""San Diego"" seem to find a small measure of harmony between voice, guitar and the insect noise that almost sings along in the background. The band's name never sounds so ill-suited as here; there's something so breathtakingly American about these noble attempts at beauty amidst clamor, without once divorcing the former from the latter. As Clear Channel Communications is feverishly banning from the playlists of their 1,170 radio stations every band and song that may bear some incidental reference to the tragedies of September 11th, it takes no leap of the imagination to suspect that Iran would never make it to the airwaves. Not that Iran's malfunctioning masterpiece stood much of a chance on making it to mainstream radio in the first place. But political incorrectness aside, Iran has recorded an absolutely amazing American rock record for the twenty-first century: dissonant and catchy, meticulous and accidental, pretentious and true. You may have to dig around some to find it, but it is well worth uncovering. And like the man said: may you live in interesting times.","Iran has the dubious distinction of an unsavory name in less than felicitous times. No doubt, when the band adopted ...

The Braille Night,Ida,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1a513d197565213bc26/1:1/w_160/a0bf2a1f.gif,2001-09-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4054-the-braille-night/,Tiger Style,"So I was just reading Matt LeMay's review of Ida's last studio album, 2000's Will You Find Me, in which he called the album a tired collection of love songs sang in 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths that tries really hard to be pretty. He was dead on. Not surprisingly, The Braille Night could be described in the exact same terms, and not just because its songs were recorded during the same sessions, and left off for release as a separate album. (Kind of like Kid A and Amnesiac, except for that whole being awesome thing.) Only in a world with little justice could Ida make the same album twice and expect Matt and I to write two different reviews. The Braille Night is a bit slower and sparser than Will You Find Me, but while Ida may tweak their formula by more adding drums, strings, bagpipes, and even band members with each consecutive album, they consistently deliver the same cloying Ida. I'm not sure Ida's fans are looking for anything new, though, as the pleasures this band delivers are centered around nostalgia, sentiment and repetition. When challenged, none of these fans will ever suggest that Ida are brilliant; instead, they defend the band with sappy looks that say, ""But they're Ida!"" Ida's first album, 1995's Tales of Brave Ida, featured only guitars, bass, and lovers-- Liz Mitchell and Dan Littleton (a former member of the punk band the Hated, and the ex-guitarist for Jenny Toomey's old band, Liquorice). Ida's sophomore effort added Dan's brother Michael on drums. In 1997, violinist Ida Pearle joined the band (she also designed the synchronized swimmers that glide past perfect stars on The Braille Night's cardboard sleeve, as well as the ones in the liner notes of Ted Leo's excellent Tyranny of Distance). Beekeeper's Karla Schickele also came along around that time, adding her bass, piano, and of course, her harmonies, to the proceedings. Then, on November 20th, 1999, Liz and Dan married. The love keeps growing. While conjuring images of feeling through darkness to find meaning with one's fingertips, this album's title, The Braille Night, grasps at poetry. And although I'm not quite sure what it means-- it seems to refer less to a touch or a tactile text than to a night that asks you to read differently-- I like it. In sound, Ida define ""The Braille Night"" as a quiet Wurlitzer drone. Often, the drone is pierced with Pearle's bow which pushes through the album, lingering until it rests as the backdrop to the album's eighth track, the detached observational travel-log, ""Gladiolas."" ""Blizzard of '78"" is The Braille Night's first single. It begins with an overbearing progression that sounds like the band's take on an 80s arena anthem, and then mellows into a bland, harmonized ballad exclaiming, ""You're a thousand miles from here/ You just want to disappear."" But it doesn't end there-- Ida keep stepping up the volume as they continue: ""Beauty shines so bright/ Vanishes from sight/ Wrap yourself in the night/ Go with all your mi-[building]-iii-[building]-iii-[building]-iiight-ah!"" It's intense! Like a blizzard! The full sound of ""Blizzard of '78"" empties out into the appropriately titled ""So Worn Out,"" a track which pairs the simple guitarwork of vintage Ida (no drums) with Dan Littleton's lullaby vocals. But Ida are most palatable at their least cohesive. In moments where plucked guitar wanders off in directions that the violin seems unaware of, or when Mitchell and Littleton fail to harmonize, they can sound playful and delicate. Unfortunately, Ida too often go for swells of perfectly united voices, or plucked arpeggios and chords that rise up to form the empty structures of an emotional climax that waits to be filled with lyrics scribbled in diaries. If any musical ideas, inspiring stories, or passionate impulses are lost in The Braille Night, it's because they're hidden too deeply in the romantic trappings, and can't be considered a reason to listen. In fact, if there's any reason to listen, I can't tell you what it is. All I know is, Ida are holding fast to the same pretty, pretty harmonies they've grown so comfortable with, and that the story's still the same.","So I was just reading Matt LeMay's review of Ida's last studio album, 2000's Will You Find ...

I usually don't get too worked up about misplacing things, but the film in this camera had been exposed to the likes of Bob Dylan, Beck, Neil Young, and Grandaddy at Denmark's Roskilde festival. I'll get over that. But I'll never be able to recover any tangible evidence of my encounter with eX-Girl, the all-female post-punk trio from planet Kero Kero. ""Hold up. Planet Kero Kero?"" Yeah, you know, that place where men are giant yellow frogs, and everyone loves to eat space mushrooms. ""Oh. I get it."" Well, they're actually from Japan. I haven't quite ruled out those space mushrooms, though. Decked out in red, white, and blue skirts with pastel, bloated headdress that made Erykah Badu's turbans seem bourgeois, these dirty three were aiming to send the entire tent to their home world with neon-fretted instruments, a Casiotone, and a drummer who does not sit. Their treble-heavy Japanese vocal timbre is supported by portions of all-out operatic voices and three-part harmonies. Perhaps you can understand my anguish at losing those photos. This was a sight to behold. ""Waving Scientist @ Frog King"" opens Back to the Mono Kero, the band's second album, with an erratic three-part a cappella about poor King Frog, whose space plane is grounded, preventing him from returning to his home planet, Frog. The lyrics are in English, but were it not for the transcriptions in the liner notes, we would probably never make sense of ex-Girl's ramblings: ""Scientist told Poor KING FROG/ 'Get 5 things and mix those up.'/ It'll be fuel for the plane to get back sweet home planet Frog. [sic]"" The trio proceeds to blast a newswire-ish vocal alert that leads into a fuzz-distorted guitar which plays modulating scales to the alternating time signatures being quite forcefully beaten out by the standing drummer. To proceed with the already-strange-enough storyline, eX-Girl rallies to gather those required ingredients for King Frog: ""Let's get excrements of dog/ Marshmallow stuck to the sole of red shoe/ High purity heroin and the atom heart mother/ What is the last one?"" All this is sung in a jarring melody that appears to be randomly generated akin to the intro. The subtle coherence and frenetic delivery of the vocals, along with the driving weight of the accompaniment, make this track the apex of the record. Not to mention the operatic drama of the three-part harmony bridge. Mono Kero doesn't immediately go sour after the opening track, but the songs get progressively less enthralling. Most of the arrangements center around out-of-control lyrics and vocal styles, with heavy doses of stand-up drumming, overprocessed guitar distortion, and Casiotone thrown in for a bit of noise. However, the smooth harmony and ecstatic vocal delivery in the Robin Scott cover, ""Pop Muzik,"" make the song a highlight and an exception to the band's formula. An interlude straight from the theme for Disney's Electric Light Parade is stuck amidst the 5/4 guitar jangle of ""Cucumber Surrender,"" and feels simply gauche juxtaposed with the song's raunchy verses: ""Before you slice him up and make him a meal/ Stroke your cucumber/ Let him know how you feel."" The synth dream breaks into a Metallican power-chord death-march before retreating back into more bizarre double entendres involving ""angry vegetables."" The ten-minute instrumental ""Crime of the Century"" could have provided a much-needed breath from the overbearing heaviness and lyrical absurdity of the album. Its plaintive main sections of arpeggiated guitar, synth accents, and vocal punctuations (reminiscent of Kim Deal's ""eye-yie-yie-yie"" part in the Pixies' ""River Euphrates"") succeed, yet this lengthy centerpiece loses its footing on the forced avant-garde jazz improv of the guitar and the hyper-fuzz bass freak-outs dispersed throughout the track. What seems to be missing from Back to the Mono Kero is not focus, but restraint. Many of the songs repeat their gibberish verses multiple times or overextend their reach instrumentally. Live, eX-Girl's energy sustained the active flow of the arrangements, thus their sound never got tired. Or perhaps I just got caught up in the space mushroom frenzy of it all.","A few months ago, I lost a disposable camera. I usually don't get too worked up about misplacing things ...

God Save the ABPK,Atombombpocketknife,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09f13d1975652138423/1:1/w_160/a2ffa4ea.gif,2001-09-24 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/346-god-save-the-abpk/,Southern,"I used to work at a shockingly lame magazine in Miami Beach, Florida, which will remain unnamed. A couple of years before I became employed there, a prankster with a morbid bent sent their offices a plain envelope with a note enclosed informing the unlucky recipient that he/she had just been exposed to anthrax spores. Faceless men in moon-suits straight out of E.T.'s sickbed scene materialized lugging sci-fi looking equipment and quickly exposed the hoax for what it was-- a medically benign joke in lethally bad taste. Fitting the bill of ""bored suburban asshole teenagers,"" a friend and I came up with an idea for a follow-up prank: mail the same magazine office a cassette of the heavy metal band Anthrax, with a similar note enclosed. Given the severity of the threat, they would have been forced to check whether the Anthrax tape actually had any dangerous spores on it. Fucking ha ha. Of course, five or so years in lockdown is a hefty tag for some fleeting yuks, so we never actually went through with it. But in looking at Atombombpocketknife's name, it occurred to me just now that bandnames which include weapons of mass death (traditionally the province of metal and grindcore bands) have gone really out of vogue. [As an aside, my hypochondriacal self just finished reading up on the very current threat of anthrax-- the affliction, not the band. It turns out that the inhalant variety (the favored method of dispersal in bioterrorism) has a 99% percent mortality rate! Glad I'm in NYC. Anthrax jokes have gone out of vogue, too, quite suddenly.] Look closely at the GIF of this album cover and you'll see a flock of soviet-made fighter jets whizzing over the slowly eroding pyramids at Giza. It's not a bad cover; taken with the album title it's very evocative, and the muted greys and blues are beautiful. And yet-- considering that, even as you read this, the largest showing of military airpower since WWII is shaping itself into a holocaustal swarm somewhere ""over there""-- it's not quite what I want to be looking at right now. Still, the powerful juxtaposition of sleek, steel, modern shapes against the massive and silent tombs of pharaohs sets the dramatic stage for an amazing rock album. Only, this record is nowhere close to amazing. It's merely pretty good. Like many before me, and many to come, I will state the obvious: Atombombpocketknife sounds like a low-budget Unwound. The singer is even called Justin, only in this case, he's a Sinkovich not a Trosper. It's a hard similarity to live up to, and these guys make a valiant attempt. In some cases, they even heroically transcend the facile comparison, sounding not so much like Unwound as a self-indulgent Quicksand. Sinkovich's even, Thurston Moore-ish delivery carries the majority of these rhythm-centric songs, but only so far. ""Gamma Rays Forever"" elucidates this point perfectly. A quick-tempo, frenetically riffy song, it grips your attention well into the improbable five-minute mark. Unfortunately, the song extends two minutes past there, in a mess of crackling feedback, guitar harmonics, and a pointless re-rehashing of the once catchy, now just irritating chorus. ""Scan Dramatics"" begins marvelously, with an ornate and strangely dancy beat, over which Sinkovich sings Satisfact-style melodies and enigmatic phrases: ""Under asterisks and departures is a cadence/ So I've settled for broken placecards and that's erratic/ Navigations and immigrations they seem impressive/ Until they're stapled to the boredom of this stasis."" Sure, why not? It is, after all, the album's unequivocally great track. There's something uneconomic and unfulfilled in ABPK's two-guitar approach. Guitarists Che Arthur and Justin Sinkovich clearly have a great ear for unconventional riffage and harmony, but something in their dual approach seems underdeveloped. ""Pair of Evil,"" a rich sonic deluge of a song, illustrates this problem. Its entire multi-minute introductory section seems to only use one guitar, over brushed drums and dubbed-in ""wind"" noise. It aims, I'm guessing, for a desolate, sparse feel. And it would have worked pretty well if not for the sheer length of the part. After the five-minute mark (these guys are pretty epic for punks) they redeem themselves with a lush, fuzzed out mid-section which includes some second-guitar noodling that grounds the murk of the main guitar. For the most part, though, the intriguing but unsteady vocal melody is left out to dry, where it could have used some bolstering guitar melody. ABPK recovers on ""Tripwire Tonight,"" a track that boasts the album's coolest verse section, as well as dissonant guitar jangle reminiscent of Sonic Youth's essential first album and the disc's most driving moments. The truly epic final track, ""Violet Encryptions (We Only Move Backwards),"" is not the closer I'd have hoped for, but it's close enough. It's still very much Unwound-lite, of course, but the guys manage to sound like they're navigating within a tradition instead of just sounding plain derivative. After a blistering volley of verse-and-choruses, and a sort of weak mid-section with radio-voice overdubs, the album ends with a beautiful six-minute instrumental outro that recalls the feel of Fugazi's Kill Taker-era gem, ""Sweet and Low,"" if a tad more melodramatic. On that note, I've got to go. The smallpox FAQ I just dug up somehow seems more relevant than this album ever will.","I used to work at a shockingly lame magazine in Miami Beach, Florida, which will remain unnamed.

Rain on Lens,Smog,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47d5e6ef959693208af/1:1/w_160/451bf639.gif,2001-09-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7281-rain-on-lens/,Drag City,"Sincerity is way overrated. Those who seek confessional truth and honesty in music forget just how inane, obnoxious, and exhibitionistic most people who are prone to confessional honesty often are. Anybody can go through the kind of emotions that are all too frequently expressed with weak, dime-a-dozen clichés. In many cases, the people with the most interesting minds are those who keep themselves guarded, confessing only to themselves, and keeping all their thoughts contained well within the confines of their own minds. As a songwriter, Bill Callahan is about as far from this type of confessional honesty as you're likely to get. Rather than telling you more than you could ever hope to know, Callahan's records as Smog provide a tiny glimpse into a brilliant, interesting, and very guarded mind. Sure, a good deal of Bill Callahan's music is dark to point of ridiculousness, and obviously not based on any kind of personal experience. But that dark, often immensely witty silliness undoubtedly reflects a side of Callahan himself. Last year's Dongs of Sevotion seemed to be a step towards a more somber, sparse, possibly genuine sound. ""Permanent Smile"", perhaps the most moving song Callahan has ever recorded, epitomized this, facing the very real issue of death with wise resignation. As one could expect from an album with the word ""dong"" in the title, parts of that album-- such as ""Dress Sexy at My Funeral""-- were darkly hilarious. But even with this underlying sense of humorous insincerity, or perhaps mocking oversincerity, the album's close, skeletal sound helped make it sound very personal. That grim humor is certainly not the stuff of typical confessional songwriting, but one certainly got a sense that it's the stuff of Bill Callahan. With Rain on Lens, Callahan seems to have turned almost completely away from more understated, tenuous sound of Dongs of Sevotion. Backed by Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo and U.S. Maple guitarist Pat Samson, a lot of the space that existed on previous Smog records is now filled. As a result, the tension that once marked Smog's sound has seriously eroded. There's no sense of a spatial void needing to be filled-- no sense of that odd, claustrophobic nearness that can come from silence. Because of this, much of Rain on Lens sounds remarkably detached, and the end result is an album that, while musically excellent, lacks the impact of pre-parentheses Smog. The first installment of a two-part title track opens Rain on Lens promisingly enough. Reverb-soaked, trebly guitars ring distant minor chords as a bare-bones drumbeat lends the song a subtle pulse. Strings echo the guitars, as more wonderfully ambiguous guitar sounds enter the picture. Callahan's spare, understated vocals lends themselves perfectly to the track. Unfortunately, the briefness of ""Rain on Lens 1"" (a mere 1:27 in length) doesn't hold up well against the more substantial runtime of weaker tracks to follow. And those weaker tracks hit instantly. ""Song"" embodies all that's cold and distant about Rain on Lens, relying on an overly repetitive, dense guitar and bass riff, with no real semblance of emotion or wit. Rather than developing over time, ""Song"" just seems to ride along on the same endless tick-tock beat and pentatonic guitar plunking. There's absolutely no motion in the track-- nothing to make you wonder, or care to wonder, what might happen next. Repetition can be a very powerful thing if it builds to some kind of hypnosis or bliss, but ""Song"" in no way benefits from it and comes across as purely boring. ""Natural Decline"" suffers from some of the same problems affecting ""Song"", often relying for too long on frustratingly uninteresting repetition. Unlike its predecessor, though, ""Natural Decline"" does brew some wonderful musical tension. As Callahan deadpans, ""Or is it just the natural decline/ Of the body,"" the music beneath him shifts into a beautifully unresolved, relatively dissonant chord-- a much needed moment of sonic conflict. Both ""Keep Some Steady Friends Around"" and ""Dirty Pants"" are similarly repetitive, but benefit from much stronger material. The latter, more than any other song on Rain on Lens, uses repetition to its advantage, building a gritty minor-chord dirge. What's more, the song actually undergoes a significant change in the middle. Given the extent to which this enhances the track, one can only imagine what some more dynamic songwriting could have done for the album as a whole. And when taken as a whole, Rain on Lens is certainly a good album. While the music is at times distant and bland, there's enough worthwhile material here to make for an enjoyable listen. What's truly missing is that little glimpse of something else-- that extra bit of dark personal insight that makes Bill Callahan's songwriting so interesting. Sincerity may be overrated, but personality certainly is not.","Sincerity is way overrated. Those who seek confessional truth and honesty\n\ in music forget just how inane, obnoxious, and ...

The Tired Sounds of...,Stars of the Lid,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54d9d034d5c69bf3290/1:1/w_160/e258a2b2.gif,2001-09-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7476-the-tired-sounds-of/,Kranky,"Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid have traveled far in the six years since their debut, 1995's Music for Nitrous Oxide. But. They. Continue. To. Move. Very. Slowly. That promising first record combined crude guitar feedback with some snippets of religious radio programming that the band captured in their home state of Texas. It was all likely laid down on a four-track in some living room arranged around a double-barreled bong. Music for Nitrous Oxide was a noble and affecting work of home recording, showing that the DIY aesthetic could be incorporated into experimental drone music just as easily as guitar-based pop. But The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid finds these guys fully harnessing the power of the studio, with striking results. Strings and horns are all over this record, and the richer palate gives the drones added weight and depth. In 1989, new music pioneer Pauline Oliveros recorded an amazing album called Deep Listening inside a 2,000,000-gallon steel tank, and the feel of The Tired Sounds is similar. Like the Oliveros record, the listener is meant to focus attention on the subtle build and decay inside these layered drones. Slight breaks in harmony between a violin and a shard of guitar feedback carry serious emotional weight. The half-second decay of a breathless French horn resonates like a perfect chord change. Silence becomes another instrument. The Tired Sounds is an exceptionally long album-- two CDs or three LPs-- with six multi-part suites over the course of about two hours. If this were the latest collection of 2Pac rarities, we'd be talking serious sonic overkill, but music that evolves this slowly needs plenty of time to stretch out. Hence, nothing about this lengthy album feels at all bloated or extraneous. The first three-part piece bears the jaunty title ""Requiem for Dying Mothers,"" and the music itself is fitting. Thick cello harmonies weave between guitar drones that have a bright, almost Celtic quality. Changes are paid out slowly over the course of close to seven minutes, until the track opens up in its second part, introducing periods of silence and deep, foreboding bass pedals. Eventually, the band's penchant for field recording rears its head, as the 20-minute ""Requiem"" transforms into a gothic piece, with spare piano and unnamable radio transmissions. ""Austin Texas Mental Hospital"" keeps the party going over the next 20 minutes, as guitar feedback and a larger orchestra modulate between two chords, rocking back and forth slowly like a self-stimming resident of the facility that gives the piece its name. The second part of the track reminds me of the Peter Gabriel soundtrack to Birdy, with hints of mechanical breathing interspersed with throbbing bass tones and a hanging drone in the middle register. The second disc has a relatively lighter tone, with more space around the instruments, more keyboards, and less guitar feedback. ""Mullholland"" seems like it could be an audition tape for the forthcoming David Lynch film of a similar name, glowing with menace like a freshly waxed, cherry-red vanity ride. ""Piano Aquieu,"" though, is the real find on this disc-- a minimal piece for treated keyboards, piano and organ, with a yearning melody and a half-hearted promise of redemption. The strings return in force on ""Fac 21,"" joining in a thick, Youngian drone. The piano-based ""Ballad of Distances"" recalls Labradford as heard through the ventilation shaft at Alcatraz, and the three-part ""A Lovesong (For Cubs)"" incorporates horns and cellos for a more conventional, but no less affecting sound. With each record, Stars of the Lid seem to assess what tools are at their disposal and then set about seeing how they can maximize the result. Their continued explorations into more varied instrumentation and richer sonics are a smashing success. Still, in their crowded field, it's hard to say exactly what makes Stars of the Lid so special. It comes to mind that their relentless commitment to subtlety sets them apart, as does their masterful hand with tone. Throughout The Tired Sounds, dissonance is doled out in small portions, perfectly coloring the sculpted fields of sound.","Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid have traveled far in the six years since their debut ...

Chitlin' Fooks,Chitlin' Fooks,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ba13d1975652139014/1:1/w_160/28b06979.gif,2001-09-23 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1447-chitlin-fooks/,ParasolHidden Agenda,"If I learned one thing during the time I briefly experimented with Dungeons & Dragons in my youth (14 years is brief, right?), it's that there's no escapism quite like role-playing. Sure, you can immerse yourself in a particularly engrossing novel, or see a movie that, for a couple of hours, suspends your disbelief so convincingly that you forget where you are. But to completely flee your reality, you have to mentally put yourself in someone else's shoes. On Chitlin' Fooks' self-titled debut, Bettie Serveert's Carol van Dijk and Sukilove's Pascal Deweze both leave their real-world projects behind and enter a fantasy land of Nashville twang and Grand Ole Opry glitz. In fact, they so fluidly blend into the new style they've undertaken here that I suspect they both have a bit of secret experience rolling the eight-sided dungeon dice. For this project, van Dijk and Deweze brought in the material they'd written that wouldn't fit in with the sound of their day job bands, as well as some of their favorite standards. Four covers range from the pleasant (Flying Burrito Brothers' ""Juanita"") to the ill-advised (the traditional ""Mother's Last Words to Her Son"" and Jimmie Rodgers ""Mississippi Delta Blues""). Deweze's compositions have a decidedly more pop bent than van Dijk's, whose more alternative background sometimes prevents her from seeming authentic in this setting. Largely duet-driven, the bulk of Chitlin' Fooks features the heavenly blending of Carol's lazy alto and Pascal's smooth, pop pipes. And on par with the harmonies found in classic country pairings Parsons/Harris or Campbell/Tucker, ""One Week Later"" opens the disc with an heart-rending tale of C&W; love gone awry. ""You were so sure you'd forget me/ You didn't want me by your side/ When someone new came and took you/ I thought I'd be glad to say goodbye."" It doesn't come more traditional than that. But these aren't all slow-dancers. A couple of the songs are lively, rebel yell-inducing numbers, such as the rambunctious ""How Many Times"" and the exceptional ""The Battle,"" both of which had this once-and-future geek digging through his closet for those sequined and tasseled cowboy boots I usually deny owning. One of the more outstanding tracks comes with van Dijk's 50's country lullaby ""Picture Book Memories,"" which features some brilliant mandolin playing by guest musician Reinhard VanBergen. Comparisons to Patsy Cline shouldn't be tossed about frivolously (and usually aren't), but on this song, Cline's unique blend of wistful country-pop is definitely summoned from the past. Supported by a cast of Belgian heavyweights (don't worry, you've never heard of any of them), the musicianship here more than matches the phenomenal vocal talents of van Dijk and Deweze, and goes a long way toward selling the sincerity of this project. Ragtime, honky-tonk, country pop and old tyme are all well represented, in addition to being well executed. But this isn't going to be the disc to use if you want to convince your indie rock pals that a lap steel is no reason to write off an album-- it's far too conventional for that. Even those with alt-country leanings may find it too down-homey. If your musical tastes are broad, however, a lot of Chitlin' Fooks could charm you with its fun spirit and genuine love for the throwback material.","If I learned one thing during the time I briefly experimented with Dungeons & Dragons in my youth (14 years is ...

Faith in the Future,Uberzone,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8cb13d1975652139735/1:1/w_160/91d73a9f.gif,2001-09-23 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8331-faith-in-the-future/,Astralwerks,"Timothy Wiles is so squelchy, so zapped by synthetic technology that he had to change his name to Überzone. Since his 1996 debut single for the L.A. label City of Angels, Wiles has been relentless in his devotion to synthetically squelchy breakbeat electro. Faith in the Future, Wiles' guest-heavy debut album, veers from summarizing his output since 1996's Space Kadet EP to pointing out the direction he sees breakbeat heading in. Thus, the album awkwardly divides in two: the first half showcases Wiles' forward-looking tunes; the second takes a brief historical look at his dated earlier work. Bart Thomas and Bigg Robb of the Sure 2 B crew help Wiles out with the opening cut, ""Beat Bionic."" Amid the backspins and crawly scratches by Davey Dave and Wiles' filthy low-end analog squirms, Bigg Robb and his pal yell, ""Fly, fly, supersonic!/ Check out the DJ!/ Go bionic!"" Not happy with leaving them to their own yelling, Wiles vocodes, spins and pitch-bends their chants into all-too familiar contortions. On ""Science Fiction,"" rulin' Jamaican toaster Beenie Man rants, ""I'm living real life/ But it feels like science fiction,"" over a woofer-worrying dub-bass framework. Occasionally, Wiles will let a 303 squirm loose, but Beenie Man stands his ground and persists in his teaching. The standout track on Faith in the Future lies in ""Black Widow,"" Wiles' collaboration with nu-breaks pioneer, Rennie Pilgrem. Beginning with a mass of conga rolls and a Todd Edwards-ish slicing of a human voice, the track soon evolves into the sonic equivalent of the photophobic aliens in the sci-fi flick Pitch Black. Wiles and Pilgrem unleash searing acid stabs and caustic Roland 303 burps. The congas and belches rise in pitch and intensity until you can't imagine that anyone but the glued-on could remain a wallflower if your club DJ dropped this devastating joint. With Davey Dave back on scratching detail, ""Bounce"" grabs hold of an old school breakbeat and throws acid loops and b-boy scratches over it in an attempt to throw it off course. But it's a disciplined break, and almost as unstoppable as ""Black Widow."" Electro-lady Lida Husik guests on ""Dreamtime,"" adding a multi-layered, fractured phoneme vibe-- it almost recalls Laurie Anderson's classic ""O Superman""-- to this atmospheric respite from the album's off-the-hook rhythmic frenzy. The snapping snares of ""Rhythm Device"" ensure that we're tossed back into a seismic funk foment. Wiles slathers on filthy analog noise and slices in more Todd Edwards-ian cut-ups of Frank Gorshin's manic Riddler laughter. In a Josh Wink-type percussive build, a cylon instructs us to ""spread love"" before the fear of that aforementioned Pitch Black alien chase is proven utterly groundless. Wiles drops the momentum for the dirge-like ""Frequency"" (featuring the world-weary and rote vocals of Helmet's Page Hamilton), and follows it with the brief and incongruously 808 State ambience of the album's title track. But wiles hopes that our faith in his electro will be restored with ""2Kool4Skool."" The track features Afrika Bambaataa, who apparently hasn't got off the losing streak that marred Leftfield's ""Afrika Shox."" Bambaataa contents himself with calling out his own name (as well as that of Soul Sonic Force), and stating the obvious fact that he's collaborating with Überzone. When he collaborated with Westbam, he dropped the mystical vision of, ""Agharta, the City of Shamballa."" If he didn't feel slighted when this track was originally released two years ago, Wiles should now feel justifiably scammed. Crystal Method's Ken Jordan assists with the skippy mess of ""Keep Go-in."" Despite the ""keep goin'!"" exhortations of a sampled MC, the track sounds so hilariously amateurish that it sounds downloaded off the nothing-excluded slop-bucket of MP3.com. Then, ""Little Dragon"" returns to the squelchy balladry of ""Dreamtime."" Though dedicated with love and respect to Bruce Lee, the track's definitely aimed at a more feminine audience. Gone are the ear-bleed tactics, allowing the song to sway on Karen Lo's pouting (possibly Japanese) vocals. By now, we're really missing the lysergic energy of the album's first half. Faith in the Future closes with ""Botz (Synthetic Mix),"" a track from 1996's Space Kadet EP which unmistakably and irrevocably shows its age-- it's nothing more than a sterile, professional remake of Josh Wink's acid breakbeat classic ""Higher States of Consciousness."" The inclusion of outdated bric-a-brac such as ""Botz"" and ""2Kool4Skool"" challenges our faith in Wiles' future. If we're ever going to regard him as more than just a promising also-ran, his next album will have to lift off from the same launch pad as Faith in the Future. Only next time, he'd better not look back. At all.","Timothy Wiles is so squelchy, so zapped by synthetic technology that he had\n\ to change his name to \xDCberzone ...

Let You Down,Kingsbury Manx,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbafeb335119a49ecac1/1:1/w_160/ba5b339e.gif,2001-09-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4451-let-you-down/,Overcoat,"Autumn is now upon us. I missed my biennial chance to stand an egg on its end this Saturday in favor of taking the Boston subway out to the beach to enjoy one of the last warm weekends we're likely to have this year. One of the things I miss most living in the city is being able to watch the leaves turn in fall, when New England's hillsides burst into brilliant, fiery displays and then slowly fade to brown. There are certain albums that just seem right for fall. They have that airy quality to them-- warm, but you can feel the first brisk breezes blowing in the melodies. One of the great autumn records is Archer Prewitt's White Sky. Everything about it suggests the time of year. But last year, the Kingsbury Manx's stunning debut album-- a swirl of placid folk, downplayed country, psychedelic flourishes, and gorgeous harmonies-- joined my mental autumn records list. This year, they're back with another helping. And just in time for the season. Let You Down opens with the title track, stuffed full of warm, lopsided guitar licks in the main verses and chilly instrumental breezes in the intervening sections. The rich earthtones of ""Porchlight"" and ""Simplify"" carry you gently to the rustic, banjo-enhanced folk of ""Et Tu, Kitte?"" The spare production of the track breaks up the easy flow of the rest of the songs nicely, and also serves as perfect foil to ""Rustic Stairs,"" which includes a subtle synth undertow. Little additions to their sound like this are apparent all over Let You Down, as the band expands their palette to include things like the Moog lines on the excellent ""Courtyard Waltz,"" which, though not actually a waltz, is one of the best songs here. The lilting verses give way to a roiling midsection, climaxing in a shower of noise that towers over the rest of the album's gently blowing passages like the first blizzard of the year. In their two albums, the Kingsbury Manx have managed to craft a sound for themselves that's unique, if not particularly innovative or new. They opt for craft over invention, a strategy that paints them as one of the finer products on the modern folk-rock shelf. Those tumultuous clouds gathering on the cover appear on the album, as well, though it's more often in the lyrics than the music. Change is evident nearly everywhere on this album, usually in the form of a relationship ending. Stubbornness prevails over common sense on the title track, which opens with the lines, ""You were always coming 'round/ But I've found that I'm always gonna let you down."" For the most part, though, lyrics seem mostly secondary, as the band usually lets the music set the mood. With Let You Down, the Kingsbury Manx have created a very likable second album that rather perfectly captures the falling leaves and southward migrations of autumn in its somber chords and crystalline harmonies. It's questionable whether or not the band will ever make the big leap into new musical territory, but as long as the albums keep coming this good, I won't mind a bit if they stick to this formula.","Autumn is now upon us.

Progressive History X,Fluke,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd4c0084474cd0c2dae/1:1/w_160/edc166b8.gif,2001-09-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3114-progressive-history-x/,Astralwerks,"Four years have passed since Fluke released Risotto, a decent but ultimately forgettable attempt to cash in on the fleeting big-beat bandwagon. After a few years of flirting with mainstream success, courting appearances on MTV's ""Amp,"" and landing spots in several soundtracks and commercials, the trio seemed certain to drop off the press radar for good. But the sudden resurgence of Daft Punk, whom most critics had left for dead after five years of silence, showed that comebacks in the club circuit were entirely possible-- some groups work slower than others, but the best ones are never forgotten. Other bygone groups followed suit, emerging from the woodwork to milk whatever was left of their fading legacies. The Crystal Method have now blighted the world with a second record, and Fluke, who couldn't be bothered to write anything new for the occasion, have pieced together a ""best-of"" retrospective. What happens to a group when the money and inspiration runs out, and suddenly, they could have sworn there was, like, at least two ounces of weed left last time they checked? This is it: Progressive History X, all your favorite hits from Fluke's illustrious, if not totally insignificant, career. The singles on this anthology date back to 1988, a time when people thought ecstasy was good for you, so they didn't pay much attention to the music. When demand for quality is low, the supply curve usually follows, and these tunes seem tailored for an undiscriminating audience. ""Thumper!,"" the oldest song in the mix, just comes off sounding dated and flat. Fluke add a pinch of jazzy bossa-nova flavor to their 4/4 formula, but the rhythms are predictable, the cheap samples come straight out of the box, and ""Thumper!"" drags on for six interminable minutes. Perhaps it's unfair to judge a 13-year-old song by today's standards; but by 1988, Tangerine Dream had already charted much braver territories, 808 State had released Newbuild, and Aphex Twin had composed half of Selected Ambient Works: 85-92. A catchy refrain can't save ""Philly"" from the same mediocrity. Though more melodically engaging than the rest of the trio's early singles, the song's stale Casio synths and unbearably tacky vocals reference outmoded influences, hinting at traces of Calloway and C&C; Music Factory. Contrary to Progressive History X's rather pretentious title, tunes like ""Thumper!"" and ""Philly"" suggest that Fluke were very much a product of their era. The evolution of time brought a modicum of improvement to their sound. ""Bullet"" and ""Tosh,"" both taken from 1995's Oto, reveal new dimensions of depth previously unexplored in Fluke's repertoire. The dense, lysergic crescendo of ""Bullet"" stands out as Progressive History X's high point, but even this track seems generic and unremarkable against the musical backdrop of its time. The bland selection of tracks culled from Risotto is perhaps this record's most disappointing fault. The best parts of Risotto were the pieces without words-- songs I'm sure Fluke hesitated to publish as singles for want of mass appeal. ""Goodnight Lover"" and ""Amp"" were actually top-notch big-beat tunes, but they're nowhere to be found on this anthology. Instead, we're stuck with the same boring ""hits"" Fluke have been pawning off on the public for the last four years: ""Atom Bomb,"" ""Absurd"" and ""Squirt."" These songs rely on nearly identical instrumental arrangements, and their formulaic tedium numbs beyond belief. The vocals struggle to sound suave, but no degree of smoothness could sell lyrical drivel like, ""Big yet unfamiliar/ Bigger than the biggest star/ Bigger, faster, very hard/ Bigger than the motor car."" Progressive History X would have fared better by showcasing lesser-known instrumentals from Fluke's catalog. As a retrospective, this album doesn't speak well for Fluke's cultural impact or historical relevance. They come off as fad-followers whose music never looked too far ahead of its time. Unless you can't get enough of yesterday's club anthems and don't crave currency in your musical tastes, I would caution you away from this purchase.","Four years have passed since Fluke released Risotto, a decent but ultimately forgettable attempt to cash in on the fleeting ...

Clouds,Ivory Coast,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ad5e6ef95969320241/1:1/w_160/4f548316.gif,2001-09-20 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4142-clouds/,Polyvinyl,"Life is evanescent and puzzling, seldom sitting still for long (like the cloud). Occasionally, stretches of time may appear to float by in a light, airy fashion (cirrostratus); but sometimes, trouble sets up camp directly above you and gives you a good, prolonged dousing of bullshit (nimbostratus). But life seldom resembles an enormous, majestic, white, floating anvil (cumulonimbus). Now that we've addressed the album title, however obliquely and dismissively, I feel ready to move on. Well, then! In commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the demise of KRS-One's career, I'd like to serve you some boogie-down style ""edutainment"" today. Consider, if you will, the following contrasts. Population
Cote D'Ivoire: 16,393,221
The Ivory Coast: 5 Life Expectancy
Cote D'Ivoire: 44.93 years
The Ivory Coast: [insert joke of your choosing] Capital City
Cote D'Ivoire: Yamoussoukro (official), Abidjan (unofficial)
The Ivory Coast: Boston, MA Form of Government/Head of State
Cote D'Ivoire: ""Democracy""/Laurent Gbagbo (seized power in coup, October, '00)
The Ivory Coast: Committee/Jay Cox (vox, gtr), Nick Hubben (bass), Drew O'Doherty (gtr, vox), Scott Craggs (there's an ointment for that; synth), Mahmood Shaikh (drums). Natural Hazards
Cote D'Ivoire: heavy surf, no natural harbors, torrential flooding during rainy seasons
The Ivory Coast: an over-reliance on their influences, and an uncomfortable imbalance between admiration and flat-out mimicry. Exports
Cote D'Ivoire: cocoa, coffee, palm oil
The Ivory Coast: highly enthusiastic, synth-laced indie-pop reminiscent of certain aspects of Polyvinyl labelmates Rainer Maria, coupled with the production values of another Massachusetts indie outfit, the Swirlies, and betraying an obvious hankering for the feel of Modest Mouse's last full-length. Oh yeah, and the vocalist comes off like a low-budget version of Edsel's singer trying to sound like Superchunk, with a pinch of Ben Weasel. External Debt
Cote D'Ivoire: US$13.9 billion
The Ivory Coast: Incalculable debt to Vanessa Downing of the great, defunct Wicked Farleys for her vocal contributions to tracks 6, 7, and 10, and a lesser debt owed to Jeffrey Goddard of Karate for blowing his horn (trumpet, actually) on track 8. Historical Overview
Cote D'Ivoire: I don't want to read your hate mail any more than you want to write it.
The Ivory Coast: The quintet released The Rush of Incoming Traffic in 2000 on Big Top Records, a full two years after it had been recorded. Thus, they had a couple years of honing their songs and their shtick before defecting to Polyvinyl and releasing this sophomore effort, Clouds. Conclusions
Cote D'Ivoire: a sure bet to supplant the United States as the global hegemonic power. The Ivory Coast: the outlook for this New England five-piece is not as certain. Clouds is without a doubt a solid album. High points include ""Five Little Graves,"" a sparse, spacy, sing-songy ode to love gone sour that recalls early Seely; ""Sixty-Five Percent"" a late-80s-style straight-up rock song that degenerates into an electronic outro like something off Depeche Mode's Violator; and, a short charming acoustic short entitled ""To My Brilliant Wigmaker,"" which boasts the album's best vocal line and chord changes. Nevertheless, there are certain prominent problems. Though vocalist Jay Cox is adequate, and sometimes better than that, his singing is the band's greatest shortcoming. His melodies would be better suited by a fuller, more in-command vocal style. Felix Houphouet-Boigny, Cote d'Ivoire's father of independence, was said to have a booming voice. Cox's, by comparison, is brittle and wavering. Will these indie popsters do right by history? Only time and their third album will tell!","Life is evanescent and puzzling, seldom sitting still for long (like the cloud). Occasionally, stretches of time may appear to ...

God Ween Satan: The Oneness,Ween,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9eb5e6ef959693214cb/1:1/w_160/1d0be61a.gif,2001-09-20 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8608-god-ween-satan-the-oneness/,RestlessRestless,"It's easy to scoff at juvenile humor. You hear a single utterance of ""fuck"" or ""pussy,"" and you turn your nose up at the lack of sophistication. No laughter escapes your tightly pursed lips. You fume with rage, images of smug, pathetic 13-year-olds spending daddy's cash on the newest Adam Sandler record cascading through your highly evolved brain. But those tightly pursed lips are trembling. Somewhere deep inside you, buried beneath back issues of The New Yorker and piles of free jazz CDs, something is happening. Almost like a little 13-year-old boy kicking you in the nuts from the inside and saying, ""Dude! Holy shit! That is fucking funny!"" Sure, you can deny this reaction. But the fact remains that, when executed properly, juvenile humor can be absolutely hilarious. If the timing's right, the phrasing's right, and the context's right, a well-placed ""fuck!"" can translate into unquestioned excellence. Of course, establishing the correct context, timing, and phrasing is not at all easy. And establishing it in such a way that it will entertain upon repeated listening is practically impossible. Ween's debut album, God Ween Satan: The Oneness, is a massive, near-overwhelming bombardment of profanity, hard rock riffing, and goofy genre parody. But no matter how absurd Ween are being, they always manage to accomplish a seemingly contradictory task: sounding exactly like every band operating within the genres they attack while sounding only like themselves. ""You Fucked Up"" is a perfect mission statement for Ween-- a sloppy, furious faux-metal number with recklessly shrieked, flat-out hilarious vocals. Granted, there's nothing particularly funny about the lyric, ""You fucked up/ You fucking Nazi whore!"" But in the context of a psychotic hard rock song, it's difficult to miss the humor. ""Tick"" couples the overblown rage of ""You Fucked Up"" with a unique brand of twisted, gleeful pop, while ""Don't Laugh (I Love You)"" distills this warped glee to its purest, most cloyingly twee essence. Songs like ""Tick"" and ""You Fucked Up"" succeed largely because they tap into that most primal, basic urge to rock out. Sure, there's an undeniable element of parody to these songs. But the parody is backed up by the fact that the songs themselves are actually really, really good. Fortunately, God Ween Satan isn't all crunchy riffs and barely contained screams. Stylistically, the album is absolutely all over the place. ""L.M.L.Y.P.,"" a longtime fan favorite and live staple, takes on the obscure Prince b-side ""Shockadelica,"" adding a distinctively Ween twist. Cheesy talk box guitars and slapbass provide perfect backing for a hilarious take on Prince's over-the-top sexuality, with Gene Ween's effects-laden vocals intoning in a high-pitched warble, ""Let me lick your pussy/ Let me lick your cunt."" At over eight minutes, ""L.M.L.Y.P."" does come awfully close to outstaying its welcome. But let's not forget that ""Purple Rain"" clocks in at an eternal 8:40. ""Squelch the Weasel"" is the closest thing to a folk song to be found on God Ween Satan. Unlike the straight-up lyrical imitation of ""Cold Blows the Wind"" from The Mollusk, ""Squelch the Weasel"" is a folk song about... weasels. Lyrical and musical elements from traditional folk music, or at least the commonly held notion of what traditional folk music should sound like, permeate the song, but there's no question that this is pure Ween. The same can be said for ""Up on the Hill,"" a gospel-styled number about the demon god Boognish that is perhaps the closest thing to a theme song the brothers Ween have recorded. A dramatic, multitracked Gene Weens croons, ""When I was younger/ My momma told me/ She said, 'Gener, I wanna smell it'/ And then she smelled it/ And it was smelly/ And I said, 'Lordy lordy lord, I'm coming home."" It's gospel, but it's totally fucked. And yet it's pulled off convincingly enough that it can be enjoyed just as much outside of the context of a parody as inside. Like any 29-song schizophrenic freakout, God Ween Satan is not without its highly questionable moments. ""Common Bitch"" is a weaker version of ""You Fucked Up."" ""Mushroom Festival in Hell"" gets points for sounding exactly like its name, but also loses points for sounding exactly like its name. The aforementioned ""Don't Laugh (I Love You)"" closes with a frightful swirl of toneless vocals that, though annoying, seems to be in keeping with the pure dementia of this album. But this, the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" of God Ween Satan, finally fixes the one biggest problem that confronted the original: undeniably shitty production. The whole album played at what seemed like a good 10 decibels below most other CDs, and the sound quality in general was aggravatingly muddled. Finally, thanks to the magic of technology, God Ween Satan can be heard in all its crisp, pure glory, without the loss of the rough-edged sound that's been a major element of the album. And it's a good thing, too, as this is one of the most wonderfully twisted albums ever to be released upon the unsuspecting masses. Unafraid to say ""fuck"" for no apparent reason, unafraid to rock out on cheesy metal riffs, and unafraid to pick to pieces just about every variety of music, Ween managed to capture the essence of their sound on their debut as well, if not better than, on any later album. And as a result, God Ween Satan isn't just good. It's fucking good.","It's easy to scoff at juvenile humor. You hear a single utterance of ""fuck"" or ""pussy,"" and you turn ...

Shined Nickels and Loose Change,Rondelles,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a413d1975652138901/1:1/w_160/bdc06117.gif,2001-09-20 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6829-shined-nickels-and-loose-change/,K,"Listening to Shined Nickels and Loose Change, the collection of scattered songs by D.C. retro-fashion punks the Rondelles, had an inspirational effect on me. It made me want to invent updated 60s dances for the 21st Century. I mean, despite all its obvious merits, the Froog really hasn't stood the test of time that well. But, being the Terpsichorean genius that I am, it was with little effort that I concocted the following 14 rug-cutters for immediate infiltration into the ""popular"" culture-- one for each track on Shined Nickels, each designed to reflect the character and quality of the song that inspired it. Make sure you practice in front of a mirror, kids! ""Six O'Clock"" - The 'Cardiac'
On this track culled from the Rondelles' first seven-inch, frontwoman Juliet Swango gives us her worst Justine Frischmann. Grab your chest in mock pain at the non-melody; let your left arm dangle numbly at your side; froth at the mouth if you can do that at will. Sway and teeter to the incompetent beat-keeping. It's all over in just a couple minutes. Just like a real heart attack! ""Safety in Numbers"" - The 'Dong (Fully Clothed Version)'
This one involves a little imagination. Pretend you're painting a canvas-- or a house, it doesn't really matter-- using only your penis (girls, a strap-on). If the time signature and tempo changes throw off your rhythm, the handclap and drum breaks provide an opportunity to get back in the swing of things. It's all about momentum, and this song has it in spades. ""Strike Out"" - The 'Shrug'
Another early vinyl-only number. Motivation for doing the 'Shrug' properly: you're trying to remove something off your back without the use of your hands. It's annoying. You try moving fast, you try moving slow. It still doesn't come off. ""Shimmybecker"" - The 'Harpy'
The monstrous motions of a chicken-hag are perfectly suited to the jerky, accelerated ""I Will Follow Him"" verse. Flap your elbows, move your neck in goofy turkeyfowl thrusts. Tear into your prey in the aggressive, carnivorous chorus. ""The Fox"" - The 'Vespa'
The title track from the Rondelles' last full-length release, the song has a catchy drive that propels it through Iggy Pop Land. Straddle your imaginary scooter and rev periodically with your hands. Sing-along to the grinding guitar hook with some ""vroom"" noises of your own. ""Revenge"" - The 'Spar'
Follow the advice of the title and box out your frustrations with lovers that have spurned you. Thuddy bass and drums are your cues for the body blows. Remember to bob and weave on the half-tempo chorus: ""I gave you my heart now/ I'm falling apart now/ ...Girls like me don't know when to quit/ You get revenge now."" ""Backstabber"" - The 'Dong (Semi-Nude Version)'
Outstanding lyrics, the most apparent 60s girl group influences, and the Church Lady's mini-organ result in a song that is complete beach-party bonfire fun. This absolutely calls for the removal of at least some clothing. See clothed version above (#2) for dance instructions. ""Kersmash, Eye My"" - The 'Living Dead'
Atrocious. A song without a brain and with a lumbering, undead quality. Like in Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video, reach into the air with both hands-- first to the left, then to the right. Then break into spastic body jerks periodically like you're being riddled with shotgun blasts from a terrified human. ""Like a Prayer"" - The 'Whore'
Once the slow, organic mini-intro concludes and the song kicks in, gyrate you hips to keep time to the slutted-up beat. Grab your breasts often. Spread and close your knees in time to the classic punk version of one of Madonna's better singles. Close your eyes often if you feel like being overly emotive. ""T.V. Zombie"" - The 'Sally'
New-wave sweetness and a bass 'n' organ-driven melody set the stage for the story of losing your unrequited love to television set. The punkier chorus reminded me of Black Flag's similarly titled ""T.V. Party."" For the dance, just do your best Peanuts go-go dancer impersonation. ""He's Got Heart"" - The 'March'
A swingy intro and verse alternates with a Bratmobile-like shout-chorus. The March is a simple enough dance: march in place with exaggerated arm swings. Keep it up at an aerobic ""intervals"" level. You'll burn calories, too, if you put the song on repeat. ""Cafeteria Rock"" - The 'Shimmybecker'
Okay, so that's the name of the band that gets covered here (as well as acknowledged in the earlier track named after the band). But it's such an onomatopoeic word in this case, perfectly suited to the way your body will start involuntarily moving to the most garage rock song on the album. So how exactly do you 'Shimmybecker?' Just like it sounds, man! ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" - The 'Twirl'
This one is easy. Despite the tempo and guitar crunch, the Rondelles haven't really altered this underrated traditional holiday carol. All you do is outstretch your arms and begin spinning-- slowly at first and then faster and faster. When the song ends, fall down. You can sing along with Swango's ""Glooo-oo-oo-oooria's"" if you want to for extra credit. ""Fort Surrounded (Turbo Mix)"" - The 'Mush'
A bad experimental noise-collage calls for bad interpretive dance. So use a lot of the pseudo-goth, smoke-like hand manipulations. Also, sort of half-lift your feet off the ground, as if wearing Mafia-fitted concrete shoes. You have to keep it up for 4\xBD long minutes. And there you have it. As soon as you've mastered these, head straight to your favorite clubs and indie dive bars to give them a test drive. Make sure you tell your friends where you learned them, because I guarantee they will ask.","Listening to Shined Nickels and Loose Change, the collection of\n\ scattered songs by D.C. retro-fashion punks the Rondelles ...

"Tigerbeat6, Inc.",Various Artists,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f49d034d5c69bf391b/1:1/w_160/3ea17442.gif,2001-09-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2007-tigerbeat6-inc/,Tigerbeat6,"A young German scholar sits with wire-rimmed glasses at a van der Rohe desk in a converted warehouse loft. Atop the desk sits a Powerbook and a small, steel lamp, the room's only source of light. Here, the man sequences clicks, squeals, and an occasional melodic chime into algebraic patterns to create a sound as minimalist as his living space. If he's feeling extravagant, which is rare, he may insert a warm drone beneath the squirming pulse. It's dance music you can't dance to, and therefore, intelligent. This stereotype has long permeated the IDM community, and with good reason: it's considerably accurate. Countless auteurs release hundreds of minimalist IDM records every month, and with each new LP, the form seems to grow more predictable. Minimalism has seen its share of classic records, but electronic music moves quickly, and its genres invariably die quick, merciful deaths. Minimalist IDM isn't buried yet, but it's a limited formula. And you can only do so much with a formula before it becomes stagnant. Tigerbeat6, the label run out of Oakland, California by that impossibly clever electro-brat Kid606, is one of the first IDM labels to take The Big Step Forward. Their concept: stripping intelligent dance music of its intelligence. Often resorting to outright silliness, and sometimes parody, Tigerbeat6 is doing for clicks and cuts what Ninja Tune did for jungle in 1997. That is, making it fun. Damn fun. Tigerbeat6, Inc. celebrates the label's incorporation as a legally recognized business entity with two discs of uncontrolled mayhem. Artists from several labels-- including the groundbreaking Mille Plateaux imprint, Planet \xB5, and Domino-- lent some of their unreleased material to this 44-track compilation. But the spotlight shines bright on Tigerbeat's artists, whose music is so fractured and hyperactive it could practically be termed ADDDM. Kicking off with Gamers in Exile's highly melodic and Macintalk-laced ""I am a Decent Man,"" the comp begins on a note that strikes a balance between the few ""serious"" tracks here and the general wackiness that infiltrates the bulk of the album. Then, we're flung headlong into ""kick'SC"" by Fossil (aka Pea Hix of Optiganally Yours), a just-totally-insane 1\xBD minutes that uses thunking drum, sea-sawing bass and manipulated vocal clips as percussion that pauses every four seconds to let Hix clue us into where, exactly, he's going to kick us (""I'm gonna kick you in... in the face/ I'm gonna kick you... um... in the face/ I'm gonna kick you in the stomach/ I'm kick you, SC""). And it just gets weirder from there. Cex's ""Furcoat"" features a wack parody of the MTV Music Awards before launching into a hilarious hip-hop rap (""Who's the man with no clothes, underwear, furcoat, chillin' in tha alley?""). Knifehandchop's ""Sun Jammer is My Favorite Pokemon Trainer"" blatantly infringes on the copyrights of DMX's ""What's My Name."" bLectum from bLechdom's ""aLways frank"" lays down squirting bass and lo-fi beats for a faux-Le Tigre smackdown whose lyrics, provided by Adult Rodeo's Mephany Stankins, scream: ""Always, Frank/ You're fucking up!"" And speaking of Le Tigre, Johanna Fateman herself contributes a beautiful, shimmering track from her electronic side project Swim with the Dolphins, which sounds not a bit like the band she made her name with. DAT Politics ricochet piercing tones off rubberband walls in the joyfully bouncy ""#21."" Max Tundra goes Casio with the seemingly boombox-recorded samba/slapbass hybrid of ""The Bill,"" and Stilluppseypa gives us the eerie interstellar tones of ""Nice Things to File Away."" But not all of these tracks are drenched in lunacy. Noriko Tujiko hands in ""White Film,"" a gorgeous track off her Mego-released Shojo Toshi album in which her lush, multitracked vocals gradually merge into a dense chorus of harmony-saturated bliss. D84's ""Rock-its-hip"" incorporates a female vocal sample that seems to have come out of the early 20th century. Brad Laner provides a post-rockin' 1994 cover of Can's ""One More Night"" by his old band, Medicine. Kid606 offers a seven-minute glitch/noisefest with an almost trip-hop beat called ""You Just Don't Understand"" that eventually becomes submerged in dense washes of shoegazing guitar. What more can I say about this? It's fucking brilliant! In a world where 90% of dance music heralds itself as ""intelligent"" and ""mathematical,"" it's refreshing to find an electronic label that can't discern the difference between ""there"" and ""they're"" in their press releases. With this compilation, Tigerbeat6 officially establishes itself as the future of IDM. With sonic assaults of unfettered craziness and a roster diverse enough to put even Warp to shame, Tigerbeat6 reveals minimalists for the stuffy, gel-haired geeks they truly are.

Drawn from Life,Brian EnoDJ J. Peter Schwalm,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc775e6ef95969322e57/1:1/w_160/94118a25.gif,2001-09-19 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2794-drawn-from-life/,Astralwerks,"What fool would deny the importance of Brian Eno? Every artist who has experimented with sound in the last thirty years-- from the Olivia Tremor Control to Public Enemy-- owes the man a debt. He invented ambient music, demonstrated how to fuse Western pop with non-Western textures, and contributed key ideas to the discourse on sample-based music. Music scribes have turned his last name into an adjective, for Lester's sake. For all Eno has achieved on his own, much of his finest work-- especially since the mid-70s-- has been in collaboration. It's never hard to hear Eno's contributions when he works with others. It could even be said that his goal as a producer and collaborator is to find the inner Eno that lies inside all of us. But being held in such high esteem means the bar is set high for what you produce, and Drawn from Life, Eno's collaboration with German composer/DJ J. Peter Schwalm, doesn't clear it. I should qualify my reservations; this is a nice record containing some interesting music, but I expect more when I listen to something with Eno's name on the cover. Quite a bit more. Part of the problem with this record for me is how closely the songs stick to the ambient downtempo template-- a template, it should be said, that Eno had a large hand in writing. Drawn from Life has the feel of a solid film score, with a tone that wanders between eerie and placid. Moody strings blend nicely with Eno's synthesizer treatments, and there are a few contributions from guests. It's impeccably recorded-- pretty at some points and vaguely somber at others-- but it never distinguishes itself. The beats, in particular, just aren't compelling, in terms of rhythm or texture. Schwalm is trained as a drummer, but you'd never know it from this record. The familiar high-hats and rim taps on ""From This Moment"" and ""More Dust"" seem like hastily constructed loops meant as mere timekeepers, even though both include live drum work. And when Laurie Anderson's vocodered voice wanders into ""Like Pictures Part #2,"" Drawn from Life seems painfully close to the hackneyed trip-hop territory that Bowery Electric is mired in. All is not lost, though. The highlight of Drawn from Life is definitely the string arrangements, which have a subtle intricacy that is at times staggering. On some tracks they work as just another element, adding slight color and shading to the surrounding electronics, while on tracks like ""Persis"" they're used for dramatic effect, with dark ostinatos meant to quicken the pulse. As a whole, Drawn from Life generally blends in well enough to work as solid background music, which brings to mind Eno's thoughts on ambient and how it can be enjoyed with little awareness. The album doesn't seem designed for that purpose, though, and more to the point, it fails the test of the second part of Eno's famous phrase: even with close attention, the rewards are relatively minor.",,5.4,
The Drive EP,The Firebird Band,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9f13d197565213b5a1/1:1/w_160/314f3df9.gif,2001-09-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3063-the-drive-ep/,HeadhunterCargo,"Forget this fact: Firebird Band frontman Chris Broach was once the singer/guitarist for defunct emo math-rockers Braid. The Firebird Band sound nothing like Broach's old band, so fans of Braid might as well approach his new project as something entirely separate. Gone are the urgent, overwrought vocals and raging guitars, replaced instead by drunkenly burbling synths and lethargic tempos. It's post-punk diluted into an ambient soup, and quite frankly, it's incredibly unengaging. The EP opens with ""Summertime Boyfriend,"" a song lost in a primordial stew of programmed non-beats, pick-sliding guitars and reverb. Broach's voice calls out through the haze, muffled by processing and struggling to place a melody on lyrics that aren't really about anything. As it turns out, this is merely the intro to the title track, and after about two minutes, the chorus to ""The Drive"" kicks in, buoyed by an actual backbeat and a little tambourine. The refrain of ""San Francisco, California to LA, CA, USA"" is marginally catchy, but it struggles to breathe under the surface of the band and the muddy production of emo engineer Wendy Schneider. If it were allowed to open up and really let loose, this song could be great. Instead, it dies faster than Pauly Shore's film career, smothered under the merciless pillow of bad mixing. The real tragedy of this is that the band seems to have some really decent ideas hiding in these formless almost-songs. The drummer could be pounding your ass into submission with his off-beat groove in ""Distance,"" but instead it sounds like he's down the hall practicing. Broach's voice is similarly drowned in the mix, and it's a shame, because the guy can really sing. Confession time: the Firebird Band have a full-length album out called The Setting Sun and Its Satellites, which I haven't heard. I can only wonder if it sounds as positively bad as this EP does. If I harp on how rotten the production is, it's because I have few qualms with the music, outside of the first track, which is just aimless. ""The Runway"" is the best song here, possessing an actual form, a good melody, some ace drumming and lots of cool ambient flourishes in the background. But, of course, the mix is all wrong. So, to get an idea of what this sounds like, grab your nearest Braid CD and throw it in your player. Next, press play and wrap your speakers in several blankets. Then, shove the speakers in a drawer and close it. Stand across the room and listen to the result. Imagining it playing at half-speed with some electronics burbling around it. You'll get a pretty good idea of just what you're dealing with here. The Drive winds down with the quasi-instrumental ""Wish,"" which is populated by manipulated vocals, fluttering synths and some programmed percussion. It's tough to latch onto anything, though, because all of the elements are once again flung like chaff into a vacuum of production ideas, tightly played, but strangely disjointed from each other. With some work, the Firebird Band could be making really great albums-- there's certainly no shortage of talent or ideas present in the band. Unfortunately, this EP lacks the punch to box me into recommending them. Do not forget this fact: passable music and poor production make for bad listening.","Forget this fact: Firebird Band frontman Chris Broach was once the singer/guitarist for defunct emo math-rockers Braid.

He could remember the day he'd taken Mike Baldwin aboard their little ship. One glance at Mike's six-string bass and Jeff Wojtysiak bristled, cradling his five-string. There'd been a friendly competition between the two ever since, each throttling their bass in constant maneuvers for one-upmanship. It was the backbone of the Volta do Mar sound. Sometimes he felt trapped between the Scylla and Charbydis, playing guitar with them. ""Dude, we fucking rocked."" Tony Ceraulo. Fastest drummer in northeast Illinois, first mate. They did rock. The band started with the three songs on their EP, barely seventeen minutes long. ""...is the Turn of the Sea"" was always a great introduction, explaining their name and all that. Phil would cast a strident line with his guitar, whipping back and forth until the bass descended like an angered bull. They'd turn the notch up and blare for twenty seconds or so, quiet it down with some soft arpeggios and spacious bass, then shift into a series of tight, interlocking motifs. Of course, another lull would be needed before the crashing, double-speed conclusion. Audiences would look confused, wondering where the microphone was, but by the end of their six-minute pieces they'd sit back surprised, hardly able to comprehend all that had just been heard. ""Did you see that long-haired metalhead?"" Jeff asked. He was totally wigging out, his head all wagging back and forth. I think he scared the scenester next to him."" Mike replied, ""The one with the Tortoise shirt? They were there together! I saw them talking in-between sets. We had his head nodding, too."" ""Munich Air Disaster"" was harder to play. Phil dug up some chords that chimed on the upbeat, a jaunty little melody that would appeal to all the jazzheads. Then they slowed down, the bass groove brooding in the depths-- a pause, then the expected freakout, distortion spreading the violent tempest around. Phil found himself shredding just to keep pace, and he didn't like the ending, when everything sped up until the jam reached its logical conclusion. The most fun piece to play was ""Mass Transit Highway(s)."" Phil led with an airy, Steve Vai-style tease, but then Tony would fire off some fills on the cymbals that sounded faster than playing cards in bike spokes. Jeff and Mike gave nods to Dave Pajo later on, whether they'd admit to having heard Aerial M or not. Phil shook his head. ""It was alright."" ""I know Tony lost a few sticks, he was playing so hard,"" Mike frowned. ""Did you get one stuck up your ass, man?"" Phil shook his head. ""When the show was over, I wandered up here to watch the sun go down. After a while I could make out a figure approaching along the coast. This tall old guy was making his way slowly across the boulders, taking his time. Eventually, he was standing right next to me, a grizzled old bastard, wrinkled and smelling of sea salt. Probably an old sailor."" The codger had cleared his throat. ""Volta do Mar, eh? Tightest act touring the West Coast, they'll probably say. I bet you fancy yourself the latest in a line of indie bands with nautical imagery. A regular Victory at Sea, courtesan to Rachel's, yep? Stuff it. The ocean moves in a million mysterious ways, boy, and you wouldn't last a second out there. You got no 'post,' just this."" He handed over a rock. ""And maybe you're not as taut as those krautrock bands, but ya need to learn how to roll. You're all sharp edges, boyo. Why, I remember the June of '44..."" ""Dude, what did you say back?!"" Tony blurted. Phil shrugged. ""Not much. He just turned towards the sea, and walked away."" Mike shifted to the other foot, restless. ""And then he sailed away on the Jolly Roger, right? Damn, Phil, you can never tell a good story."" Jeff laughed. ""No, it was a crane! God sent a crane right down, lifted him back up to the heavens..."" The three walked away, chuckling. Phil turned and watched the surf wash up on the shore, mixing the sea, the cake, the seaweed, the tracks leading from the sand to the water. The rock sunk with barely a splish. He'd show that old man.","Phil Taylor sat on a cliff at the water's edge, looking down at the rock below. He could hear ...

Fading Left to Completely On,Trans Megetti,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fd13d1975652139554/1:1/w_160/89d165cb.gif,2001-09-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8140-fading-left-to-completely-on/,Gern Blandsten,"As much as we Pitchforkers like to comment on cover art, I just wish it could be ignored right now. A simple hand-scrawl of airplanes at odd angles, while easily dismissed only a week and a half ago, has taken on new significance. Just to clarify: the Trans Megetti aren't insensitive fucks. Their cover art is a few months old, but their rage and devastation sound almost as fresh as our own. Hailing from the fabulous New Jersey coast, the Trans Megetti put out an album whose name now has similarly awful connotations (1998's Steal the Jet Keys) before releasing Fading Left to Completely On. As refreshingly abstract and association-free as the name is, the music constantly tears open old scars, emotional and musical. With the spacy rip of echoed pick scrapes streaking over a furious punk rock backdrop, the first track, ""Rio Nexpa,"" sounds a bit like At the Drive-In circa two years ago. Stick around for a few moments, however, and the differences begin to show; Mark Tesi can actually sing, for one thing, and he hits just the right balance of wry desperation, anger, and melody on the chorus (""I can't wait to be over you""). ""Trick the Switches"" takes things in a slightly more straightforward though still complex direction, relative newcomer Mark Candidi's nimble bass holding the whole thing together. And, with the same biting agility, ""Soon Be Seeing You Later"" fuses classic rock start/stops straight out of ""Magic Bus"" with new-school drive and Tesi's forcefully plaintive descending vocals. Without providing anything revolutionary, the Trans Megetti give enough of themselves to make this sound distinct and worthwhile. The album's high point, the near-poppy ""Gina,"" dares to drop the tempo a bit and lets Julian Grere's alternately stabbing and bitterly legato guitar play around with Candidi's loping bassline. Tesi delivers an acid dissertation on a summer love gone wrong, interlaced with dark imagery (""Both tired of living/ Black dashes on my wrists""), pleading vocal cracks on the chorus, and an ominously chanted final line, ""I'll wait for you always."" After that, the quality drops a bit, but there's still quite a bit of good left. ""Haircut"" moves between chilly riffs and drummer Brian Strahle's stomped-out rhythms and hypnotizing guitar hiss, throwing itself into each but never getting caught up in either. Tesi's vocal urgency propels ""On the Monday"" with a seething minor-chord intensity, and the song's final tension-releasing instrumental breakdown disperses this energy into the windswept limbo-fragment ""Late September."" ""Turned On"" comes off just a little too bitter, burning through a maze of jumpy guitars and scathingly blunt lyrics (""You don't look so slick/ When you're sucking dick"") with only a few sections of melodic saving grace. ""Hop the Fence"" does a little better with the same basic premise, adding a despairingly melodic chorus and stripping the song down from there. The final track, an acoustic number called ""Following,"" shouldn't work by any means in the context of the rest of the album. However, Tesi's expressive voice (and the cool effect of the background guitar strums and percussion) make it a decent, unpredictably offbeat end to the record. But then again, sometimes there's no avoiding the cover. What's the point, really, in listening to some kids' comparatively puny sorrows and frustrations at this point in time? You could ask the same question of all sorts of ""art"" that aim to represent loss and suffering. All I can think of is this: the Trans Megetti don't really try to make anything beautiful. They make it rock, which is a different, half-unknown quality, and that's good enough for me.","As much as we Pitchforkers like to comment on cover art, I just wish it could be ignored right ...

Re:volution EP,Coldcut,by: James P. Wisdom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a615c0084474cd0c0893/1:1/w_160/8654c9ac.gif,2001-09-18 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1533-revolution-ep/,Ninja Tune,"Let's make this short and sweet: I thirst for more than this from Coldcut. Since Jonathan More and Matt Black realigned my listening sensors with 1997's Let Us Play, I've followed their trail through the countless comps and EPs, sniffing for their delicious blend of wildly creative sampling and addictive beats. Sometimes, I discover pure bliss in a beatific clamorous frenzy; other times, it's warmed-over remix material. Today, they bring you latter variety. Coldcut's latest release, the Re:volution EP, is an odd soundtrack to More & Black's own political party-- the Guilty Party, they call themselves-- which had the crazy nerve to run against current premiärminister Tony Blair and his primary opponent, dagen då den färglöse William Haugue, in the June of 2001 British elections. Needless to say, they experienced none of the third-party (or, in this case, like, twelfth party) success Jesse Ventura pulled through with in the 1998 Minnesota primaries. It's a shame, though, because their platform is one that most could get hip to: turntables would conform to a British standard, higher education would be sought by all, and lower taxes would be implemented for vinyl. To be fair, Re:volution is all of three tracks. It totals 11 minutes in length, four of which are taken up by Nautilus' ""Space Journey,"" a mellow remix of Coldcut stuff over a backdrop of classic space techno tones. Created using Coldcut's infamous VJamm mixing software, the single won an Intermusic contest last year. But, while decent enough, the track is eminently disposable. Another eight minutes of Re:volution are spent on the instrumental version of the EP's title track. Thus, judgment rests on the four minutes of the title track itself. What I hear so strongly recalls Coldcut's previous work that it's like a repressing of some distant track from their bulky back catalog I listened to once and forgot about. What's worse, the track lacks the unfettered creativity and sheer ""bollocks"" (as those English boys might say) that sets much of their catalog upon a pedestal all its own. ""Re:volution"" attempts to pound home the point that the ""lunatics are taking over the asylum,"" amidst swelling guitar loops and a flurry of Blair and Haugue soundbytes that lack enough order to be meaningful. End product: a forgettable single worth forgetting about before you even buy it. I thirst for more than this from Coldcut.","Let's make this short and sweet:

Rooty,Basement Jaxx,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21f9d034d5c69bf2b0e/1:1/w_160/ba84f63c.jpg,2001-09-18 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/571-rooty/,Astralwerks,"We all have double standards. For instance, the synthetic plaid pants that make your grandfather the butt of snide jokes at family reunions might actually look pretty smart hugging the hips of that cute sales clerk at the record store. Why is that? What makes something tacky in one context and clever in another? What, to use more precise words, distinguishes kitsch from cheese? Well, self-awareness, first and foremost. Ugly, outmoded clothes somehow become fashionable if we know that whoever's wearing them is in on the joke. The best designers take retro concepts, strip them of their ugliness, and rehash them for the public in relevant, aesthetically enticing ways. That's why brown is making a comeback, and why I'm offering to pay $20 for a Hypercolor t-shirt that still works (if you have one, my email address is on the staff page). It also explains why groups like Les Rhythmes Digitales, the Avalanches and Daft Punk have fared so well in the eyes of critics and fans. These groups exhume socially abandoned or rejected musical trends, reinterpret them with glib modern sensibilities, and hold them up, with a wink and a nod, for the rest of us to see. But retro-fetishism has its limits. Some trends aren't worth reviving; others have not yet passed far enough from memory to qualify as fair game. Fresh wounds are sensitive, and a fresh faux pas is strictly off limits. Brixton's Basement Jaxx, venerated purveyors of acid-tinged booty house beats, toe the line between kitsch and cheese, and all too often skirt across it. As so many critics have hastened to note, Felix Burton and Simon Ratcliffe (the Jaxx by their proper names) are two of the weirdest, most innovative and talented house producers on the scene. This much I'll concede-- their music is out-there, stylistically unparalleled by anything I've come across, and marked by immaculate production. Unfortunately, it's often so tacky that it's impossible to stomach. Their music is generally solid, but it's hard to tell if Basement Jaxx are taking the piss with their lyrics. If so, they're joking about things I don't think we're ready to laugh at. And if they're taking themselves seriously (I suspect they are), well, that's even worse. Rooty's vocals bring back horrorshow memories of Technotronic, latter-day Prince and Lords of Acid-- memories that those of us who have listened to Lords of Acid and survived would rather forget. The shrill, sex-crazed drivel distracts the listener's ear from the underlying instrumentation, which sometimes has a lot to offer. The album's single, the creepily Janet-esque ""Romeo,"" commences the program on a bitter note. Featured diva Kele Le Roc's mindless lyrics spill over the predictable, shallow melodies, bland beats and clichéd basslines. ""Breakaway,"" however, relieves the tedium with a foray into the darker facets of funk. Treacherous squelches murmur beneath industrial percussion and old-school synths, while quirky bleeps and bloops creep in wherever the music pauses. The song's unintelligent vocals are also unobtrusive enough that they don't ruin the rest of the song. But only two other songs on this record really deserve ink. The vocals recede to the background in ""Crazy Girl,"" a spaced-out electro joint whose chunky basslines, insistent chimes, skittering beats and washed-out guitar samples frolic over several layers of ambient noise. This track is downright stunning, and only piques my frustration because it suggests that if Ratcliffe and Burton had canned the grating vocals, all of Rooty might have been this good. In fact, the only track that ever benefits from the inclusion of singing is ""Broken Dreams,"" whose Hawaiian and spaghetti western themes hint at Luke Vibert's work with B.J. Cole. Sha's refined, bubbly female vocals are more Stereolab than Salt'N'Pepa, and they nicely accentuate an otherwise pleasant song. I have the same objections to this disc that I had to Kool Keith's Sex Style-- even though the rhymes were tight, and the production spoke for itself, the tastelessness of Keith's lyrics seemed to overshadow the record's finer points. By the same token, a few fatal flaws eclipse all of Rooty's abundant qualities. Basement Jaxx have taken kitsch a few steps too far. They may be in on the joke, but this shit is no laughing matter.","We all have double standards. For instance, the synthetic plaid pants that\n\ make your grandfather the butt of snide ...

Ume Sour,Sisterhood of Convoluted Thinkers,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4225e6ef959693207d9/1:1/w_160/c0035523.gif,2001-09-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7190-ume-sour/,Darla,"It's uncommon, but it happens: sometimes an album's opening track can predict the quality of the whole. Usually, it's when the song is either so beamingly wonderful or so gut-wrenchingly terrible that I've already decided whether it's going to do time in my permanent collection, or be sent off to the hands of some poor, unwitting sap rummaging through the broken jewel cases of a bargain bin. Receiving many, many discs for free, as I do, as a reviewer who receives free discs-- yes, that's the kind with music, which cost nothing, to me, receiving them free of cost as I often do-- the latter option is often fairly appealing, seeing as how these free discs can be cashed in for a profit. But I try not to let this affect my overall judgment of the free albums I receive (by the truckload, of course, and daily). And even still, the opening tracks often drift by, in that neither overwhelmingly negative nor overwhelmingly positive way. A gentle Casiotone drumbeat begins clunking out of the speakers, along with a simple, tinny, synthesized melody. A quiet, lovely bass guitar harmonizes with the melody, and an endearingly mousy female voice-- an American voice-- rhythmically sings the names of Japanese citizens Ami-chan and Mai-chan. Then, without warning, English lyrics: ""When you walk down the street, you tell everyone you meet/ 'Yes, I can speak a little English, ma'am.'/ When you pull up your chair, with your serious stare/ You say, 'There are four people in my family.'"" Then, some noisy, explosive, yet subdued samples along with some whispered chanting for a bit of a breakdown, and a reprise of the Casio melody and the main lyric. Then, it's over. The description is basically useless, though. I'm hooked from hearing it, not reading about it. And I'm about to suggest you follow my lead, after this informational section here. ""Ami-chan, Mai-chan"" is the opening track from the Sisterhood of Convoluted Thinkers' second LP, entitled Ume Sour. The record is dedicated, by the married duo of Robert Christiansen (an ex-member of Grenadine and recorder of the first two Labradford LPs) and Jeannine Durfee, ""in fond memory of our favorite nation and our favorite cocktail."" It was recorded while the couple lived in Tsuyama, Okayama, Japan for 2\xBD years, teaching English for a living; this explains the opener's subject matter. The album is titled after the aforementioned cocktail, ""which,"" as a handwritten note on the cover itself describes, ""is a sour plum drink"" with which Christiansen and Durfee fell in love during their residence in the country. Ume Sour is brimming with charm. Christiansen and Durfee's adorable voices, combining as often as they go solo, sing tales of their everyday life in Japan. Accompanied by another simple synth beat, but this time with a plaintively gorgeous chord progression on guitar accompaniment, they sing ""Song for Tony and Ian"" for a couple of friends in America whom they miss. The touches upon their general feeling of nostalgia, and their musings on entering into an alien lifestyle. The pair then wryly follow up these sentiments with ""Tottori Made,"" a purely American-style country hoedown with down-home guitar licks, galloping horse-hoof rhythms, and lyrics in Japanese. On the rest of Ume Sour, the Sisterhood take their gentle, electro-indie style and create quite a few unforgettable melodies along the way, not to mention seamless shifts in tone, harmony and production packed into each track. The verses of ""Lunchdate"" groove minimally alongside a funky programmed beat and guitar riff, before breaking into a joyous chorus of ""ba-da-da-bum's"" and blissful baroque piano. ""The Rainbow"" starts with about 10 seconds of Christiansen singing to a folky guitar, and then literally fast-forwards through what seems like a whole song's worth of melody in another 20 seconds, giving way to a electronic groove, beautifully reverberating piano, and a poetic chorus summing up the husband and wife's union in a strange land: ""Stone after stone in the river we've thrown/ We're building an island/ And I want you to be here with me/ And I want you to see what I see."" Ume Sour's finest moment comes two songs from the end of this short and sweet record. Christiansen opens ""Armstrong Archer"" with a powerful droning synth and spoken-word vocoder, almost appearing as an homage to Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman."" The track spans the next five minutes with piano and guitar, acoustic bass, paired vocals and slight electronic augmentations. This, the record's most deceptively simple, brilliantly crafted melody, shifts and twists into its various sections so effortlessly it almost makes one feel weightless. Near the end, as birds chirp and fingers delicately walk the ivories, Christiansen comes back with his vocoded voice of comfort: ""When you're tired and no one's there/ Just remember the path... to happiness."" The Sisterhood of Convoluted Thinkers have created a minimal, beautiful record that follows this path. And I somehow knew it would, right from those opening moments. I only wish I'd paid for it.","It's uncommon, but it happens: sometimes an album's opening track can predict\n\ the quality of the whole ...

Collected Simplesongs of My Temporary Past,Schlammpeitziger,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37213d1975652138abc/1:1/w_160/459df598.gif,2001-09-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7023-collected-simplesongs-of-my-temporary-past/,Thrill JockeySonig,"I don't listen to music when I'm depressed, so I've been dreading writing this, my first review since all those thousands of people died in New York, D.C. and Pennsylvania last week. In fact, during the past six days, I haven't listened to any music at all. I tried listening for escape; I tried listening for ""understanding""; I tried listening just to listen. But nothing worked. My ears were for news and that was that. I was glad, then, to see this record by Schlammpeitziger in my mailbox. Not only is this compilation culled in part from three albums I already own (hence, I already know the music intimately), but the tenor of the music itself made listening bearable. This is simple, pretty, unassuming music existing for no other reason than to bring a little beauty into the world. And right now, it's hard to imagine anything else sounding better. A little background about Schlammpeitziger. The name is a pun on a German word for a species of fish that lives on the ocean floor-- loosely translated, it means ""mudwhipper."" Cologne keyboardist Jo Zimmerman uses this breezy handle for his solo music projects. He's worked with others in the Sonig camp, including F.X. Randomiz (the two make lovely music together as Holosud), and his first LP was remastered by Jan and Andi from Mouse on Mars. Musically, Zimmerman is an Elder in the 5% Nation of Casiotone, composing most of his music using the pre-set tones of cheap, off-the-rack keyboards. He sticks fairly close to a pop structure, with warm, charming chords playing memorable changes. My first impression was that Zimmerman built his career around the best moments from side two of Kraftwerk's Autobahn, certainly a noble calling. Hearing these songs again for the first time in a while, though, I was struck by how much they reminded me of Plone. They're lovely music-box melodies with just the right hint of mystery, only unlike the bulk of Plone's songs, these are timeless. From the albums I have, I can say that Zimmerman chose the tracks for this compilation very wisely. All my favorites are here. ""Elektronischer Country,"" from the vinyl-only Erdrauchharnschleck, was the first Schlammpeitziger tune I fell in love with. It's a sad ballroom dance for a roomful of junked robots, with a slide guitar telling the leads when to dip. ""Honkytonk Schlickummpittz"" is lighter than Air (French Band), with an inspiring march of melody and gentle, encouraging electronic handclaps. ""Hallimaschbomba im Kreisverkehr"" paints with the 8-bit Super Mario Brothers palette, but does so with subtle, spacious strokes, avoiding the grating frenzy of most music inspired by the archaic entertainment system. ""Hydraulicmeisters Halbtagstanz"" sounds like theme music from a late 70s documentary on the jogging craze, poignant and lovely. None of these 13 tracks is less than good. The perfect visual representation of Schlammpeitziger's music is on Augenwischwaldmoppgefloete, which also happens to be my favorite album cover. Check it out sometime. It's a photograph of folks dressed in some kind of Western European Alpine garb, dancing in a circle with locked hands. The women are anchored to the ground while the men float in mid-leap, writhing like they were each shot out of a cannon. It's one of the purest expressions of joy I can imagine. And like this collection, it seems like a good place to start from when you decide to crawl out of the dark.",,8.6,
Lubricate Your Living-Room,Bionaut,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2adb1335d7bf1698546/1:1/w_160/91a984f8.gif,2001-09-17 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/707-lubricate-your-living-room/,Matador,"This latest collection of Jörg Burger's tinkly downbeat techno speaks to Matador's archivist approach to electronica. Matador's previously released Burger works such as the Modernist, and his collaboration with Wolfgang Voigt (aka Gas, aka Mike Ink), Burger/Ink. The label is clearly convinced that everything this guy creates is worthy of preservation. This is a false assumption. It's true that, since his conversion to all things ecstatically bangin', Burger has released some real treats. The Modernist's Explosion and Burger/Ink's Las Vegas are both rich in fuzzy Cologne machine-funk and Nicolas Grimshaw-ish reflective surfaces. However, this latest compilation, which draws on Burger's solo work from 1993-1997, will disappoint all of us converted by the previous albums. Drawing from the shallow well of downtempo techno mood music, none of Lubricate Your Living-Room's eighteen tracks dare to grab you, or even pluck up enough courage to ask if you wouldn't mind paying attention for just a brief moment. The collection begins in an ironically porno fashion with ""Electric Campfire (In a Neo-Ackerman Style),"" on which a lazily strummed guitar nuzzles up to languidly bobbing synth-wobbles. After we've become thoroughly attuned to the slack groove, a breathy lady recites the title before some snaggle-toothed, unkempt fellow starts reading from a hardcore grot novel. The guy reads the excerpt in such a unengaged manner that I wonder if Burger's intent is less to titillate (as fellow Cologner Khan would desire) than to express his opinion on the banality of porn. If this is Burger's intent, his unremarkable accompaniment to the reading complements perfectly. ""Theme,"" originally released on the Bionaut's 1996 LP, Please Teenage!, is a pretty, bass-burden lope through machine-tooled sterility. ""Lush Life Electronica,"" culled from the 1995 album of the same name, maintains a reasonably pleasant, downy-soft vibe and brings back the hazy acoustic guitar of ""Electric Campfire."" ""The Juicy Reminder,"" from the same album, benefits from a propulsive low-end pulse that forces an urgency on the track that the huge synth washes and delicately echoed electro-spangles lack. Also excerpted from the Lush Life Electronica album, ""Student Bashing at the Seaside"" depicts the beauty of the coastline, where the violence of doffing up college kids takes place rather than the actual busting of ribs and bruising of limbs. Here's another example of Burger either being a stern commentator on violence (or just being a wildly inappropriate titler of tracks). However, with ""Memphis Sci-Fi,"" Burger's got it just right. Amid the Tennessee twangs, he scatters \xB5-ziq bursts of percussive white noise and lets the two opposites rub against each other for three minutes. From the 1993 album Music for Stock Exchange (recorded under the guise of Ethik-- essentially a split CD with solo material by both Burger and Wolfgang Voigt) comes the pad-saturated ""Bluebelle (The Birth of a Bionaut),"" which bobs along with percussive tinkles and a softly looping Detroit-style bassline. ""P. Bateman,"" also drawn from the Ethik sessions, serves as an homage to no one's favorite anti-hero, American Psycho's Patrick Bateman. The track sounds like Yellow Magic Orchestra outfitted with up-to-date studio gear, but once again relies on sheer banality (perhaps) to convey Burger's low opinion of Bateman's infamous serial murdering. Burger has a much higher opinion of a character he calls ""Wild Horse Annie."" He devoted an EP to telling her tale, and Lubricate Your Living-Room contains two of its cuts. On ""Der Kurze Weg,"" Burger incorporates unpredictable chord changes, coming off like an impossible blissful Richard D. James. And ""Wild Horse Annie as Herself"" glistens in its sterility, an aloof spaghetti-western guitar piece prepared for an exhibition of Mies van der Rohe furniture. The irresolvable problem with Lubricate Your Living-Room is that the anthology fails to introduce anything new. Why does Matador think that a compilation of material at least four years (and several genre-shifts) old was worth releasing? The true Bionaut fans would have bought the source EPs and albums years ago, and those hooked by the previous Matador releases of Jörg Burger's work will be unavoidably disappointed. I suppose lounge DJs might find something breezy enough to slip in between Nicola Conte and Dining Rooms tracks. The rest of us don't have to look far to find much more invigorating living-room lubricants: DNTEL's Life is Full of Possibilities and the Other Peoples Place's Lifestyles of Laptop Café leap instantly to mind as superlative examples. When Burger does come up with some spanking new tracks, I trust Matador won't wait five years or so to release them.","This latest collection of J\xF6rg Burger's tinkly downbeat techno speaks to\n\ Matador's archivist approach to electronica ...

If I had a single rice krispy for every time I've seen a plot on television or in a movie involving a not-so-subtle transformation from pathetic nerd to popular hottie, I'd be in a state of perpetual breakfast. While these transformations can oftentimes be dramatic, they're never surprising. All the paste-on zits and pocket protectors in the universe usually can't hide the fact that the ""geek"" you're looking at is an attractive actor or actress trying his best to play up loserdom with a weak-ass Anthony Michael Hall impression. John Linnell and John Flansburgh, on the other hand, are true geeks. Serious geeks. The kind of geeks who probably used to spend their Saturday afternoons trying to get their Apple IIc's to calculate pi. But these aren't your average geeks-- these geeks managed to craft two undeniably brilliant albums with backup provided only by primitive Macintosh MIDI in lieu of traditional instrumentation. They Might Be Giants and Lincoln certainly sounded like nothing else before or since. It was clear that their progenitors were wise-ass geeks-- but it was just as clear that they were pop-sensible wise-ass geeks. Hooks were always present, even as the duo of Johns began to ditch the MIDI for the more analog sound of an actual band. Even with 1996's admittedly spotty Factory Showroom, the boys managed to make their music concurrently smart, goofy, geeky, and insanely catchy, in spite of a guest appearance by Neutral Milk Hotel's Julian Koster. Don't think you can hide from me, Julian. Obviously, a lot has changed in five years. The humble geeks, who at the time of their last album enjoyed a substantial cult following of middle-aged computer programmers and younger ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" fanatics, have started receiving recognition on a scale never before imagined, penning music for ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and Austin Powers 2. These nerds have gone popular. And as a result, their once-intelligent style has given way to dumb, silly pandering. Perhaps harder to explain, the pop hooks have given way to unwieldy disasters. Yes, Mink Car is crap. All the charms They Might Be Giants once seemed to possess have dissipated into a cloud of embarrassing awkwardness. Some of the songs on Mink Car are just so hideously atrocious that one can't help but wonder how the same duo whose last album was host to catchy, memorable songs like ""Until My Head Falls Off"" could release an album that not only leaves you with nothing to remember, but makes you eager to forget. The worst offenders on Mink Car are the one-off (or, in some cases, two-off) genre pieces, which come off about as authentic as spam, and not nearly as amusing. ""Mr. Xcitement,"" a disgusting mess of computer preset breakbeats, far-too-goofy lyrics, and former Soul Coughing frontman Doughty, possesses absolutely none of the wit and nerdy charm we've come to expect from They Might Be Giants. It's tempting to accuse ""Mr. Xcitement"" of being a disjointed train wreck of a song, but one gets the sense that if it were more cohesive, it might be even worse. ""Wicked Little Critta"" treads dangerously close to Presidents of the United States of America territory, substituting brain-twisting pain for oddball fun. Failed experiments are not all that new to They Might Be Giants, but the thing that makes Mink Car beyond dismal is the fact that all the potential for goodness on the album seems to have been squandered. ""Bangs"" is possibly the album's best track, simply because it actually sounds like They Might Be Giants. It's got a bouncy, sufficiently twisty melody that lends itself perfectly to Linnell's trademark nasal whine. But the song is never really allowed to come into its own. Instead, it's transposed way too early, and at a seriously inopportune moment, haphazardly breaking up the flow of a song that otherwise excels in the melody department. ""Hovering Sombrero"" is more consistent but less catchy, fading far too easily into the background. It's a sad thing when you find yourself waiting for a band to pull off a second-rate imitation of their older material, but it's almost unavoidable with an album as disjointed and generally bad as Mink Car. As if general mediocrity weren't enough, the two Johns had to go back and screw up some songs that have existed in vastly superior forms for years. ""Another First Kiss"" and ""Man, It's So Loud in Here"" both sounded great as live staples. But the former has been transformed from a driving rock song (as heard on the band's 1998 live album, Severe Tire Damage) to a limp, trite acoustic number with a played-out drumbeat that can only leave one thinking ""Lyte Funky Giants."" ""Man, It's So Loud in Here"" has been desecrated with cheesy dance drum machine beats and synth bass. The chorus still packs a bit of punch, but the song itself sounds more like ABBA than fellow geek-rockers Devo. In the aforementioned movies and TV shows, the made-over geeks always settle perfectly into their newfound social standing. After all, they were really just poorly dressed, acne-ridden popular kids all along. But it's clear that this is not the case with They Might Be Giants. You can dress an A/V club member in Abercrombie and put him on the football team, but at the end of the day, he'll be badly bruised and weeping longingly for his history textbook and vintage Amiga. The volatile tides of popularity won't be kind to They Might Be Giants for long. Let's just hope they figure that out before they give up on whatever bits and pieces of their musical identity they still have left.","If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that every hardcore geek is nothing but a popular kid in bulky ...

Never Mind the Context,Moth Wranglers,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3cd13d197565213bdf0/1:1/w_160/4be1a683.gif,2001-09-17 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5444-never-mind-the-context/,Magnetic Motorworks,"Years ago, my family spread out to the rims of the country, like grease confronted with the cleaning power of Dawn. We didn't start out that way; we all, at one time or another (and for a brief moment, all at the same time), lived in Southwestern Pennsylvania. These days, however, the entire Dark brood are perimeter-dwellers: Boston, Florida, Houston, California. Overextended and mutually distant, we can barely coordinate a family get-together that doesn't involve a funeral, let alone produce a work of artistic merit like the Moth Wranglers' debut album, Never Mind the Context. But that's exactly how this bi-coastal collaborative project operates. The primary Wranglers, King Missile alum Chris Xefos and Flare's LD Beghtol, are graced by a mutual admiration society comprised of Camper Van Beethoven's Victor Krummenacher and Jonathan Segel, the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt and Claudia Gonson, the Loud Family's Alison Faith Levy, the Posies' Ken Stringfellow, and the Geraldine Fibbers' Bill Tutton, among many, many others. A grand total of 29 contributors in all-- credited in egalitarian fashion with no mention of who played what-- even outnumbers my entire aforementioned extended family. A thousand attics and flea markets must have been raided to yield the album's menagerie of castaway ukuleles, autoharps, Marxophones, Aqualins and peck horns. But the songs are more traditional than their bizarro instrumentation would suggest, and all the musical toys are put to good use. Instantly, you're clued in that this won't be a normal listening experience. ""I Will Never Marry,"" a trad-Appalachian gospel-death ballad, sung a cappella, opens the album with a suitably ambivalent tone. The oddity of hearing Xefos and Beghtol deliver the line, ""I'll be no man's wife,"" in beautiful harmony is eerie and comical at the same time. From then on, they swap at lead vocals, with Beghtol's polished obsidian vox taking the lion's share. ""Turnabout"" is a screechy, Grange Hall dancin' ditty that recalls Camper Van Beethoven, and not only because it showcases the unmistakable and masterful fiddling of Jonathan Segel. The croony vocals telling the tale of British serial killer Denis Nilson in eyebrow-raising narrative also have that same California-freaky worldview: ""It's just a phase, perhaps a ruse/ It's nothing bad, he's just confused/ It's just a shame, it's just the truth/ No, nothing serious, call it youth."" Did I mention the hand-claps? ""Let Go, Let Me"" pits guest tormented-soul Stephin Merritt's deepest, most sonorous vocals yet against Tutton's contrabass (contrabass wins, but just barely). Beatlesque ""ooh-la-la-la's"" fill in the background along with soft bongos and a quivering vintage keyboard chord. The song positively slinks. Elsewhere, Belle and Sebastian are given a stylistic nod with the post-twee ballad, ""Yet Again."" Sing-songy strums, autoharp and a muddy-in-the-mix mandolin solo commingle behind a lilt that would make Morrissey's knees buckle. The album's not without its tedious moments, though. The moribund ""Six-Page Letter"" moves as if in slow motion. It reminded me of Nicole Kidman's excruciatingly drawn out speech patterns in Eyes Wide Shut. The song's lethargic melodies, bombarded with echoing distorted guitar effects, don't really go anywhere. And ""Record (She's Saving a Page)"" sounds like a bad marriage of third-rate prog and the Church. Such marriages inevitably end in divorce. But all told, the Moth Wranglers' idea of deconstructionist wackiness, folkie instrumentation and a sense of humor matched only by their sense of melody hits like a breath of fresh air in a dog kennel. From the overwrought Pink Floydian bombast of ""Don't Look Now"" to the European drinking hall singalong, ""Figure-Ground,"" the Moth Wranglers are all over the musical map. The result is cohesion sacrificed in the name of playful and insolent experimentation. And against odds, Xefos and Beghtol pull it off more often than not. The world needs more ideas like the Moth Wranglers: people who hold a wake instead of a funeral, who take drugs because the world doesn't seem normal without them, and who scribble moustaches on Mona Lisas.","Years ago, my family spread out to the rims of the country, like grease confronted with the cleaning power of ...

Headcoats Down!,Thee Headcoats,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75fea9e61561daa5586/1:1/w_160/cd09c9a9.gif,2001-09-16 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7983-headcoats-down/,Damaged GoodsDamaged Goods,"""Suicide? I think not!"" ""But Master Holmes, the note!"" Watson clutched the document apparently left on the mantelpiece by the newly deceased Lord Barrington-Essex III, whose body lay on the parlor floor of his winter estate. He read the words again: I cannot bear it anymore. Blink 182 and their countless ilk have reduced the esteemed form of punk rock, ultimately, into a cheap novelty act, devoid of purpose or soul. Alien Ant Farm's ""Smooth Criminal"" cover was the nail in my coffin. The only option, for me, was suicide. Goodbye, uncool world. Lord Barrington-Essex III Holmes dismissed the note with a wave of his oversized hand. ""Watson, you will observe that the signature on that note does not precisely match the one on this crude painting Lord Barrington-Essex created before he was fiendishly murdered! Also, it is clear that the victim was not disenchanted with the state of punk music-- he was, in fact, just discovering it. Note what was in his stereo unit, which, I deduce from the lack of dust, was played extremely recently. It's Thee Headcoats' debut album, Headcoats Down! ""But Holmes,"" Watson blurted, ""that record is from 1989. He could have been waxing nostalgic for what once was..."" ""Not so, my dear Watson. The original release of this album on Thee Headcoats songwriter Billy Childish's own label, Hangman Records, was vinyl-only. This is a CD reissue from Damaged Goods. A fresh purchase. No doubt Lord Barrington-Essex was just getting excited about music again. Listen!"" Holmes pressed play. The first song, ""Smile Now,"" blasted out at high volume. It contained all the simple trademarks of Thee Headcoats: blues-infused punk with buzzing guitar; Billy Childish's compressed vocals laughingly bleating out simple lyrics of loveloss and retribution. Somehow it made the ""Louie, Louie"" chord progression sound fresh. ""Please Little Baby"" followed, with a fast surf beat propelling a rolling organ. Watson perused the liner notes but couldn't find a keyboardist listed. He did note that the three gentlemen mugging on the cover had equipped very familiar headgear. ""Watson, notice how he says 'Oh pleeeaase.' How a rocker says 'please' is of paramount importance. Rock is the music of begging, a prayer that turns women from mere mortals into gods. I deduce that Billy Childish is the real thing by the way he intones the word."" ""You're correct as usual, detective,"" Watson agreed. ""Even when he's putting us on, it's not with some snotty joke, but with a warm winsome manner."" Indeed, this music, in all its simplicity, ran from quite sober to downright silly. ""Child's Death Letter"" detailed Mr. Childish's last wishes and funereal philosophy. ""When I die, I don't want no mark on my grave,"" he howled on the almost-folk number, as an unsteady slide guitar ascended like a departing soul. On ""John the Revelator,"" a song performed a cappella, save for a handclap, Childish was so ensconced in his message that he practically gargled with passion. Then, on ""I'll Make You Mine,"" he laughed a great laugh as he sang, ""I'll put my brand on you."" And, in perhaps the best song Watson had ever heard on the subject, Thee Headcoats waxed eloquent on ""Wily Coyote"": I got a stack of dynamite and a hundred-ton weight
I got TNT birdseed to use as my bait
I got a blunderbuss contraption and a Sherman tank
I got cannonball fuel injected rollerskates
So little Road Runner, let me put you straight This blues stomper left the impression that the Road Runner would soon be caught. It was a message of hope for Watson. ""No, Watson, no one listening to this record could kill himself. It's too full of laughter, and the simple bluesy lines with punk's raw vitality are an unbeatable formula that a prolific master like Billy Childish would repeatedly use to generate hundreds of whimsical, wonderful songs. And I've just deduced that, despite the recent breakup of Thee Headcoats, they're coming out with another album later this year. Billy Childish has even assembled a new band called the Buff Medways. ""So Lord Barrington-Essex III would have something to live for."" ""Yes. Note also how he's been sawed in half and preserved in an aquarium of formaldehyde. A strange method of suicide."" ""It's like the work of that installation artist Damien Hirst with his Stuckist Art movement. Do you think Hirst could be the culprit?"" ""No, dear Watson, I'm afraid this is the work of my archrival, Professor Moriarty."" ""Really! It seems he's been responsible for the last seven murders we've investigated."" ""Yes, he's been on quite a roll."" Holmes pocketed his magnifying glass and donned his overcoat. Watson grabbed his bag and made ready to leave. Then he paused. ""Holmes?"" ""Yes, Watson?"" ""Do you think you'll ever get sick of punk rock?"" Holmes sighed. ""I swear I'll quit it someday, old man, but I say the same thing about my seven-percent solution, and just look at these tracks.""

II,Idyll Swords,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a0ea9e61561daa4abb/1:1/w_160/eceba2de.gif,2001-09-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4065-ii/,Communion,"The world is getting smaller all the time, and one of the benefits of increased global communication is that the individual, unique musics of all the world's various corners have become available for anyone to listen to. There are so many different folk styles out there that it would be hard to hear a glimpse of them all, but basically everything is on record somewhere, from Indonesian gamelan orchestras to Hungarian wedding dances and Delta blues. The end result of all this mixing and cultural exchange is recombination, a trend led largely by the pop world, whether it's George Harrison arranging rock songs for the sitar or the Squirrel Nut Zippers mixing up a tossed salad of klezmer and 20's hot jazz. Of course, it's hard for artists in these early stages of grafting styles to avoid boring genre exercises and clumsy failed experiments, but often you'll end wind up with fairly transcendent results; witness the Police's fusion of reggae and new wave. Idyll Swords are just the latest in a long line of bands who set out to bring disparate styles together, and you have to admire them for their sheer ambition. Unfortunately, on this, their second album, their reach sometimes exceeds their grasp as they simply try to bring too many sounds under the same roof without first trying to figure out a way to combine them. At times, the North Carolina trio's sophomore effort feels like a demonstration tape of various folk styles from around the world, with genre exercises from Central Asia sitting rather uncomfortably next to a study on something from Eastern Europe. That's not to say there aren't some truly outstanding moments here. The three musicians, Chuck Johnson, Grant Tennille, and ex-Polvo guitarist Dave Brylawski, are all guitarists at heart, but on II, they tackle a wide variety of stringed instruments from around the world with admirable facility. They open the record on a deceptively dark note, with the ominous riff that announces ""Tantz,"" but quickly allow it to subside in favor of field recordings and a triple acoustic guitar piece. The guitar piece flows through multiple movements, some full of frenzied rhythms and interlocking ostinatos, others brimming with melodic grace. ""Lake Palace"" follows, offering one of the album's only two vocal selections. It's quite pleasant, calling upon Appalachian folk for inspiration before landing in slower territory akin to the British folk of the late 60's, as practiced by Steeleye Span. It also lasts well over eight minutes, sadly overstaying its welcome by a few minutes. ""Eschuteon Ascent/Biza's Theme"" makes a natural union of guitars and Eastern strings before descending into a soup of field recordings and audio editing that would fit nicely onto an Olivia Tremor Control album. It's this first half of II that generally feels the most cohesive, largely employing one of two strategies: one draws on the folk of the US and UK while subtly incorporating oud and cumbus into these otherwise straightforward compositions, while the other offers complex guitar pieces filled with modal scales drawn mostly from traditional Middle Eastern or Eastern European music. The band have opted to make the second half of the album the more varied one, with mostly uneven results. The rub is, many of the short pieces offer potential, but go nowhere. The sitar and ambient noise interlude of ""Bani Park"" gives way to the acoustic slide guitar workout of ""Abreaction,"" which is criminally allotted less than a minute to work its magic. ""The Mezereon Dynasty"" follows, full of pentatonic melodies plucked out on some sort of lute-- possibly a Chinese ruan. ""Nile Monitor"" is an all-too-brief piece dominated by meditative raga-like oud parts and droning tamburas. The album does end at its highest point, though, with ""Steep Creek,"" a fabulous triple acoustic guitar instrumental that nods to the late, great John Fahey, and wouldn't sound terribly out of place on Gorky's Zygotic Mynci's Blue Trees EP. The primary shortcoming here is that not enough of these pieces feel fully fleshed, and a few of them just tend to either hover listlessly or wander aimlessly. By and large, each style is still too compartmentalized for the album to feel truly cohesive. What you end up with is an occasionally engaging record that tries admirably to eliminate the very distinction between the folk styles of the world, and ultimately fails in that endeavor. It's a reasonably enjoyable listen, but most will be distracted by the time it's over.","The world is getting smaller all the time, and one of the benefits of increased global communication is that the ...

Rockin' the Suburbs,Ben Folds Five,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde8eb335119a49ecf98/1:1/w_160/dee9a133.gif,2001-09-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3135-rockin-the-suburbs/,Epic,"I grew up in the suburbs. We lived about 30 minutes outside of fabulous downtown Hartford, Connecticut, in a little burg crisscrossed by the interstate and assailed by fast food restaurants dying to get a piece of property in our little town. I lived in the part of town where all the farms were slowly being conquered by developments, a pretty lengthy bike ride from anything of interest. Overall, growing up there wasn't bad. We were comfortable, the schools were decent, if underfunded, and crime was nearly nonexistent. Of course, growing up in this environment also meant long sessions spent in the blistering hell of boredom. This forced us to devise our own methods of entertainment, which by high school, often involved what Ben Folds calls ""rockin' the suburbs."" My town was full of kids who had quite a bit of money, but didn't have a clue what to do with it (IRA? What's that?). This led to a war of car stereos, many of which were suped up to epic proportions for maximum suburb-rocking capabilities. I'll never forget playing a Beethoven CD on my friend Dan's 30-megaton sub-woofers-- it didn't exactly rock, but it sure sounded messed up. More often, it was the strains of Pearl Jam or Sir Mix-a-Lot wafting across parking lots and shaking the paint off of nearby houses. I can imagine Ben Folds approving of our stereo wars. After all, he knows as well as any of us just how much boredom the suburbs can generate on a given day, and he seems to know his place as a suburban musical phenomenon. He even hired Ben Grosse of Filter and Fuel fame to produce his first solo album. ""I got the quintessential suburb-rocking producer to work for me. He knows all the sliders and knobs that denote the rocking of suburbs,"" says Folds of his choice. Largely, his choice seems to have paid off, as his new album is a pretty enjoyable romp that will almost certainly be rocking the suburbs for at least a few months. Rockin' the Suburbs finds Folds largely backing off from the dramatic chamber-pop that characterized his last outing with Ben Folds Five, instead bringing in former Beck cohort DJ Swamp to provide beats for a few tracks, and playing most of the instruments himself (he's actually not a bad drummer or bassist). John Mark Painter's string arrangements can still be found on a few songs here, including a couple of the best ones, but they're decidedly downplayed. ""Annie Waits"" opens the album on an upbeat note, with a Swamp-provided beat and rolling Steinway. Folds intones in his trademark ""I'm not a singer, but I'm singing anyway"" voice, inaugurating the first tale of suburban alienation, loneliness, and, of course, boredom. If there's one thing Folds has developed over the years, it's an extremely distinctive melodic sense, and there's not a song here that fails to hook you at least somewhere. The highlight of the album comes at about the midpoint, with the quietly waltzing ""Fred Jones Part 2,"" a remarkably mature portrait of a man who loses his job at a newspaper to a young go-getter after years of faithful service. It's one of his finest ballads and it demonstrates admirably the effect that simple words can have. One of the things I've always liked about Folds' more serious songs was that he rarely reaches for poetry, opting usually to just lay his thoughts out for you in plain sight. This approach serves him well on songs like ""The Ascent of Stan,"" about an aging hippy who became The Man he once spoke out against. Then there's ""Not the Same,"" a bizarre tale of a stoner who becomes born again after a drug experience. It helps, naturally, that both of these songs possess great melodies and interesting music to back them up. But elsewhere, the music is merely serviceable, and the stories are predictable, such as on ""Zak and Sara,"" which tells the vague tale of a bored girlfriend sitting around while her boyfriend buys a guitar. And then, of course, there's the single and title track, ""Rockin' the Suburbs,"" which attempts to do to the modern rock mainstream what ""Underground"" did to the indie rock scene all those years ago. About half of it succeeds, with hilarious exchanges like, ""I got shit running through my brain/ So intense that I can't explain/ All alone in my white boy pain/ Shake your booty while the band complains,"" squaring off against weak lines about driving to the store for some Preparation H. Folds obviously sees right through the false rage of bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach, but he ends up leveling his guns on himself with lines like, ""You better watch out because I'm gonna say fuck."" Does anyone remember ""Army?"" Or how about the song that immediately follows, ""Fired?"" It ends with a big, harmonized choir of Ben Foldses shouting ""Motherfucker!"" It's hard to understand why Folds still feels like he has to include this kind of thing on his albums, when most of his songwriting points to the fact that he could easily move beyond it. At any rate, the irony is thicker than cheesecake. Rockin' the Suburbs ends with ""The Luckiest,"" a sappy ballad about watching the birth of his child, but after the debacle of the two previous songs, I don't so much mind. At least Folds is being honest when he sings about loving his wife and child. I'm just waiting for the day when Folds finally stops trying to be a novelty. When and if that day comes, he may yet make an album that lives up to the promise of the Five's debut, while demonstrating the maturity he's acquired over the years to full effect. For now, you've got Rockin' the Suburbs, a worthy, but occasionally frustrating album that's fairly good for what its title suggests. Hell, it's probably being wielded in some stereo war back home right now. For that, at least, it beats the shit out of Beethoven.","I grew up in the suburbs.

Ruby Series EP,Rebecca Gates,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bef7abf31b7dc7156221/1:1/w_160/3c4c25d8.gif,2001-09-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3405-ruby-series-ep/,Badman,"People used to think Rebecca Gates and Scott Plouf were a couple. Probably because they were a recording duo that gave themselves the suburbanite surname the Spinanes, and the photos on the sleeves of their debut album, Manos, were all matrimonial. (The photos were actually from Gates' parent's wedding.) But despite the fact that Gates and Plouf rocked perfectly in sync, as though they could read each other's minds, they weren't a couple-- just a sparse, driving rock band with a White Stripes-style set up of drums and guitar. After the Spinanes released their second album, 1996's bittersweet Strand, Scott Plouf split to play drums for Built to Spill. The Spinanes didn't quite ""break up,"" though-- Gates brought her guitar to Chicago and recorded Arches and Aisles with a guest roster of the Windy City's post-rock icons, proving in the process that she could handle songwriting on her own. Three years after the release of Arches and Aisles, Gates' Ruby Series EP comes like a postcard from a friend you've been out of touch with. ""The Seldom Scene"" arrives on your doorstep with warm guitar chords and Rebecca's breathy delivery. You can tell that her recent stint performing jazz standards has improved her control; her voice hovers carefully on separate syllables as she soothes: ""You say you feel so soulless, and never right/ Maybe you could stay here, where the light is safe."" The sparse arrangement seems like a folk ballad until the instruments converge suddenly in jazzy accord. Thankfully, though, there are few post-rock signifiers here-- just producer John McEntire's vibraphone lead. ""Lure and Cast"" follows with a different kind of bait for Gates altogether. The programmed bass pattern and her shimmering guitar almost recall Massive Attack's ""Protection."" Gates' fans might worry about a transition to a sort of Sheryl-Crowe-esque ""adult rock"" with all the smooth sounds here, but her subtle guitar accents make it clear that she's comfortable not having to play so hard to flesh out the sound. Plus, the skittering drums keep the song sounding fresh, further exploring the lush developments of Arches and Aisles, even if it is a bit of a stretch trying to rhyme ""so radiant"" with ""so, so salient."" The big shocker comes with ""In a Star Orbit,"" which starts with bass beats and chimes that might have shaken ass on an early-90's Saint Etienne album. Gates' voice runs through a processor, adding a hazy sheen to her lazy Prekop-ian pop vocals. The song shifts nicely after about a minute and a half, from a synth bassline to a more live continuum, but McEntire's too-strong influence adds an unnecessary air of Sea-and-Cake tropicalia. The tune is forgettable but it's book-ended by two of the best songs on the album. ""Move"" features Gates' slow acoustic strumming and melancholy musings: ""A listless life filled with death-wish panderings and diets."" Static electronics whisper faintly, and Chicago Underground Trio's Noel Kupersmith draws a hint of tension from the increasing speed of his bassline. ""Doos"" is an odd pastiche of styles, but it works: Red Red Meat's Brian Deck loops tinny beats, while Gates adds O'Rourkian squiggling and layers her voice for a sensual summer daydream: ""Caught in the breath of the thought of the warmth of lips tingling."" Ruby Series has a strange power to recontextualize the retro sounds listed above. To Gates' credit, the overproduced electronics mix well with the glockenspiels, marimbas and Wurlitzer organs, in the end sounding more like her songwriting and less like a McEntire remix. But some might wonder why her experiments with texture are necessary at all-- especially when the closer, ""I Received a Levitation,"" harkens so pleasingly back to Strand days, with acoustic fret-squeals, restless percussion from Kupersmith and Gates' triple-tracked confessionals. The picture focuses when you consider the periodic emphasis in the EP's title, and the photos taken by Gates in the sleeve of beachfront resorts and lounging sunbathers. These songs are each snapshots, a sort of emotional travelogue for us to take a voyeuristic listen to. If you can get past the fact that Gates isn't rocking out anymore, this is just the thing for a languid weekend afternoon.","People used to think Rebecca Gates and Scott Plouf were a couple.

All Is Dream,Mercury Rev,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c439eb335119a49ed8cd/1:1/w_160/49294510.gif,2001-09-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5236-all-is-dream/,V2,"Chicks. I mean, what's up with them? There's one outside my window right now, down on the concrete, in the arms of some big, oily brute, passive and seemingly content. But the thing with me and chicks isn't just that they're virtually always down there when I'm up here. The thing that gets me is that the guy she's with doesn't know any better than I do what's going on inside her head. As much as he smiles and nods along when she moves her mouth, no male will ever truly understand what females are ultimately up to. I can only guess that she stopped out there because she was drawn to the sweet pop music dripping from my stereo like an ant stuck in a puddle of honey. At least, this is how frustrated hetero males have been thinking for as long as the thoughts of frustrated hetero males have been recorded. Inked on papyrus, set in type, expressed in terms of humors, temperatures, and tides, and eventually grooved onto vinyl, it's a piggish sentiment backed by libido and ignorance (and more than a little unfair to women). It's also, oddly enough, a sentiment that's been the motivating force behind a great deal of beauty, most notably in pop music (possibly the greatest repository for male frustration ever created). Much of the time, male pop is trying to both seduce and explain the opposite sex in the same instant, knowing all the while that one of these objectives is a lost cause. Mercury Rev's All Is Dream claims its share of pop brilliance by taking up this position with enormous reserves of intelligence, grace, and emotion. As long-time Rev flautist Suzanne Thorpe-- who's been with the band since their sprawling psych-noise days-- has been demoted to the orchestra pit for this release, the band is now all-male. With Dave Fridmann mainly taking the role of expert producer (and making contributions on bass and mellotron) and Jimy Chambers passing the sticks on to new drummer Jeff Mercel, the core group is possibly the most stripped-down line-up in Mercury Rev's 10-year recording history. Though their approach hasn't changed from the radically orchestral turn of 1998's Deserter's Songs, these songs are far more personal than their last set. Even when bathed in Jonathan Donahue's constant wash of fever-dream lyrics, it's clear that these are Mercury Rev's first real (though predictably odd) love songs. ""If God moves across the water/ Then the girl moves in other ways/ And I'm losing sight of either,"" he sings in ""Nite And Fog,"" his collapsing love story gently suspended above its lyrical melancholy by the song's flowing strings and Fridmann's buoyant bassline. Throughout the album, Donahue takes the concept of woman as the proverbial ""other"" to an almost illogical extreme, funneling oceans of uncertainty into a female form and turning these emotions out again into uncomfortable reflections on death, fate, and all of those other nasty things. ""Tides of the Moon"" takes a typical image of femininity and transforms it into a meditation on loss and powerlessness (""The threads that run through your life/ Hang from your sleeve/ Wind through your soul/ The kind you can't control/ But wish you could break""), only to come back to the now-unsettling romantic sentiment, ""It ties you to me."" But even during all this, the band refuses to simply wallow in emotion, instead confronting their connections to pop lyricism smartly. On ""A Drop in Time,"" Donahue quips, ""Her words profane, her mouth divine/ I tried to sympathize with both sides/ But I was caught, like a floating thought/ Stuck inside of Leonard Cohen's mind."" As playful as they can occasionally be, though, Donahue's words are always rooted in nagging doubts and creeping riddles like those voiced by his creaky falsetto in ""Lincoln's Eyes"" (""What is dark like a birthmark/ Pulls like a magnet/ Male and female/ And covets like a dragon?""). The music, of course, is by no means as unstable as the lyrics. Where the band seemed a bit more easygoing and loose in their explorations of the orchestral-pop form on Deserter's Songs, All is Dream takes the band's newfound preoccupations in a definite direction. This makes the music sound a bit overdetermined at times (most notably, the opening track's calculated symphonic swells), but for the most part, their grasp of the sound has improved. The dark, driving rocker ""Chains"" cuts out at exactly the right moment, and bangs out a few cathartic Beethoven string hits before again steamrolling ahead. A soprano voice that sobs out the soft prelude to ""Lincoln's Eyes"" returns as a banshee-wail in the song's brink-of-chaos midsection, and the song returns obliquely to this sound in its gorgeous bowed-saws outro. ""Little Rhymes"" makes the most from its beautiful pedal steel lines, accentuating Donahue's melody without obscuring it. Of course, Mercury Rev don't need all this fancy instrumentation to get their point across. ""Spiders and Flies,"" a relatively simple piano ballad, stands as the most affecting song on the album. As Mercel caresses the keys, Donahue quietly unravels, confessing fears of death and disconnection from the unnamed female who's been flitting around the edges of the album the whole time. And, with shocking ease, the band shifts from these depths into the exultantly dreamy final track, ""Hercules."" As the song's percussive glee swells alongside guitarist Grasshopper's transcendently melodic noise solo, it becomes oddly clear that Mercury Rev has, in some way, come to love this uncertainty-- just as the pop protagonist can't stay away from the inscrutable object of his affections, and the pop fan can find a place in its heart for the erratic motions of a band as in love with music as this one.","Chicks.

Lest We Forget,Pinetop Seven,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07e5e6ef9596931ff71/1:1/w_160/5163a166.gif,2001-09-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6304-lest-we-forget/,Self-Help,"I just read in Time magazine today that scientists have essentially found a way to predict what the end of the universe will look like. Okay, so this particular issue of Time was several months old, but the study of the universe, how it formed, and how it may end has always fascinated me. Anyway, it seems that physicists and astronomers are settling on a theory that basically suggests that the universe will keep expanding until it reaches total entropy, dying with a mere whimper in the near-infinite future, with even base subatomic elements separated by light years of cold, still void. There's really no need for us to worry about this, of course, as the universe's coming degenerate period will only bring T.S. Eliot's predictions to life after the passage of trillions upon trillions of years-- long after our own blue planet is consumed by our expanding sun. As terrifying and incomprehensible as the thought of our universe destroying itself through infinite expansion may sound, I can't help but think that'd I'd like to be there when it happens, so that I might get to see what it looks like, or perhaps what it sounds like. Obviously, we'll never know what sights and sounds await the end of the universe, but as far as finite, timely considerations go, I think Pinetop Seven may be just the band to soundtrack the coming of entropy. A year ago-- even a month ago-- I never would have thought that, but Lest We Forget, a mail order- and tour-only compilation of unreleased Pinetop Seven material, suggests otherwise. Lest We Forget contains five unreleased gems from the songbook of Pinetop leader Darren Richard, a remix of ""Mission District"" from last year's astounding Bringing Home the Last Great Strike, and over half an hour of excerpts from a live, improvised performance that constituted the soundtrack for the silent film The Wind. It's these improvised pieces that conjure for me images of the very fabric of the universe flying apart and reconstituting in unimaginable ways. For the live soundtrack sessions, Richard tapped Chicago-based percussion wizards Glenn Kotche (Boxhead Ensemble, Simon Joyner) and Gerald Dowd, violinist Jessica Billey, and vibist Jason Adiesciewisz. The five musicians carry on a meditative dialogue that's remarkably evocative-- you usually find yourself getting an image and then looking at the track listing only to find that the image you visualized is suggested by the title. ""Norther!/ Storm Subsides"" is perhaps the best example of this, with Kotche and Dowd whipping up a massive whirlwind over the subtle textures provided by the other three musicians. It's free music at its finest, capturing a specific feeling and conferring it upon the listener. This gives way to the pensive holding pattern of ""Horse in the Sky,"" which is ultimately relieved by the compilation's closing track, ""Burial Scene,"" which is dominated by Richard's spare piano lines conjuring Chopin at his most despondent. This performance sits surprisingly well next to the first six tracks, all of which constitute proper songs ranging from 1998 to 2001 and recorded at the band's Chicago loft space. You know a band is really great when you're totally entranced 15 seconds into the first track on their odds-and-sods, tour-only collection of outtakes and live recordings. The unreleased demo ""Mosquitoes"" opens with a percussion loop before piling on vibes and guitar. Richard croons through the verses before layering his buoyant tenor in lush harmonies on the chorus. Melissa Bach's cello-- the only instrument not played by Richard on the song-- swoons sonorously on the bridge, lending a dark underpinning to Richard's stunning falsetto harmonies. Darren Richard is completely alone on the other demo included here, the gorgeous ""Cradlesong."" It's almost unbelievable that one man recorded this by himself, as all of the instruments are impeccably played, including a deftly interwoven guitar loop. Richard even goes out of his way to vary his tone on the backing vocals in order to make it sound like multiple people singing backup. The structured instrumental, ""Some Ritual Business at the Lake,"" from the sessions for Bringing Home the Last Great Strike, also features Richard solo, throwing down some impressive slide guitar. Richard is joined by frequent collaborators Ryan Hembrey and Charles Kim on ""Left in a Room for Days"" and ""Devoted Won't Do,"" both culled from the sessions for Rigging the Toplights, the band's sophomore album. ""Left in a Room for Days,"" had it been included, would have been a highlight on an album full of highlights, with its descending chord sequence and wailing slide guitar. I've often heard critics desperately try to label Pinetop Seven's music as insurgent country, but it's songs like this that confound even the most adept categorizers. Finally, Mactra's remix of ""Mission District"" largely preserves the original's structure, preferring instead to toy with each component of the arrangement, vacuum-packing the bass and sucking the vocals into an echo chamber. Not usually being one who digs remixes, I tend to look for a certain moment where the remix takes the original and makes a truly inspired addition, which is just what Mactra does in the last verse, adding wild percussive loops for a propulsive climax. Lest We Forget portrays Darren Richard as the central force in a very versatile collective that draws freely from the communal Chicago scene. Richard himself emphasizes that this is a demo-quality release intended for fans only, but it seems as though he's just being modest, as there's only one moment on the entire disc-- the hissy intro to ""Cradlesong""-- that sounds underproduced. The fact that something so utterly worth having is unavailable in stores is a shame. Any extra effort needed to obtain this collection is well worth it, as the rewards contained within are enough to repay any expenditure, and ease your nerves about your place in a doomed universe.","I just read in Time magazine today that scientists have essentially found a way to predict what the end of ...

"The Glow, Pt. 2",The Microphones,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45f13d197565213bf3d/1:1/w_160/fda3e8c5.jpg,2001-09-10 06:01:40,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5269-the-glow-pt-2/,K,"It's an amazing thing when pop music expresses beauty through ambiguity. After being pummeled over the head for years and years with I Love Yous and You Are So Beautifuls, the most direct way of expressing images of love and beauty have pretty much lost all impact. Melodic tricks can wear thin just as easily. Hooks are all well and good, but when you've seen a hook enough times, you know not to bite. Perhaps the problem is that most pop music doesn't put enough faith in the listener. Everything must be laid out in the most obvious of terms, and eventually, that obviousness obscures whatever the music originally intended to convey. If you want to invoke the quiet beauty of the ocean, for example, you can write a pop song that says, ""Hey, the ocean is really beautiful,"" or you can try to come up with a sonic approximation of that beauty. It's a huge undertaking to attempt to capture something so visual in a song. But for Phil Elvrum, it seems to be second nature. The Glow Pt. 2, the follow-up to last year's gorgeous brainmelt It Was Hot, We Stayed In the Water, captures the sea, the sky, and the mountains in a sonic panorama that seems to live without beginning or end. A sprawling, swirling composition that is both as varied and as consistent as the landscape itself, The Glow Pt. 2 exceeds even its predecessor in capturing the simultaneous wrath and fragility of nature. And sounding really, really cool. Like It Was Hot's ""The Pull"" before it, ""I Want Wind to Blow"" opens with subtle manipulations of acoustic guitars across stereo channels. There's an amazing sense of open space to the track as overtones from a low, rhythmic rumble, and from the stereo acoustic guitars, create a wash of barely audible noise floating through the mid-frequencies. ""I Want Wind to Blow,"" like a good portion of The Glow Pt. 2, uses repetition and understatement to transform itself from a simple song into a landscape. And as with any landscape, the way the songs on The Glow Pt. 2 are perceived greatly affects the impact of the record. This album simply must be listened to on headphones. Hearing the record on regular speakers is like staring at the Grand Canyon through a Viewmaster. The illusion of depth is weak at best, and easily broken. With headphones, the sounds contained within the record absolutely come to life, bouncing and slithering from ear to ear. The use of stereo panning is as integral a part of the disc as the melodies and instrumentation. With this stereo enhancement, parts of The Glow Pt. 2 are absolutely breathtaking. And perhaps the single most breathtaking song on the album is its title track, which may or may not be a thematic follow-up to ""The Glow,"" the 11-minute-long centerpiece of It Was Hot, We Stayed In the Water. Opening with blasts of fuzzy guitar and massive drums, ""The Glow Pt. 2"" segues somewhat abruptly into another segment of stereo acoustic guitars, before giving way to a drop-dead gorgeous wash of multitracked organs. On top of this, Elvrum lets loose what could be the most striking lyrics he's ever penned: ""I faced death. I went in with my arms swinging. But I heard my own breath and had to face that I'm still living. I'm still flesh. I hold on to awful feelings. I'm not dead... My chest still draws breath. I hold it. I'm buoyant. There's no end."" Elvrum delivers these lyrics in a melodic stream-of-consciousness style that's structured enough to be musically riveting, but loose enough to sound spontaneous and sincere. As the last words of the song fade, the swell of organs segues into a trebly acoustic guitar and hi-hat section highly reminiscent of early Modest Mouse. Nowhere on this album are there short, straightforward pop songs like It Was Hot's cover of Eric's Trip ""Sand"" or ""Karl Blau."" Instead, the record ebbs and flows gracefully between fragile acoustic numbers like ""Headless Horseman,"" and overpowering swells of noise, with all points in between represented. The flow between songs on The Glow Pt. 2 is absolutely flawless-- the album functions as one giant piece of music as well as it does a collection of songs. Themes of flesh and blood, water and wood, and life and death permeate the record, connecting well enough to create a sense of something greater without beating you over the head with its concept. Ultimately, The Glow Pt. 2 is the sound of one man working through a changing landscape-- a single voice challenging its surroundings while also accepting that it's powerless to alter them. The disc ends with a throbbing heartbeat, the most basic sign of life having braved through the stormy trek that precedes it. The Glow Pt. 2 is unpredictable, volatile, vibrant, terrifying, and comforting. The Glow Pt. 2 is alive.","It's an amazing thing when pop music expresses beauty through ambiguity.

Know by Heart,American Analog Set,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07a13d19756521383c7/1:1/w_160/e55b1eb9.gif,2001-09-09 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/157-know-by-heart/,Tiger Style,"The American Analog Set make the kind of music that wraps around you like a home-knit sweater-- the sleeves may be a little irregular, but the elements can't get you. And on top of that, it's totally one of a kind, just like that sweater. Low, Seely, and the New Year played through a pillow are good points of reference for the American Analog Set, but over the course of four albums and a rarities compilation, the band has grown far too unique to bare direct comparisons. This band is the only one I've heard that can open an album with a song called ""Punk as Fuck"" and make it feel like you're curled up next to a fire with a good book. Vibes swell around you, guitars meditate in the background, and then the vocals enter, a soothing tenor calling you out of the real world and into that warm place. Brushed drums and barely-there bass propel the proceedings with measured patience. There's nothing urgent about this music; it flows at its own pace. From there, Know by Heart flows gracefully through a series of warm textures and somnambulant melodies, much like the band's past efforts. Thankfully, though, the band have avoided becoming stuck in a holding pattern, leaving their old trademark Farfisas in mothballs, and instead pulling out a phalanx of alternately soothing and buzzing organs and Rhodes pianos, changing up the sound often. The band also toys with a few new tempos and meters. Overall, the effect of these changes is that Know by Heart offers a great many more standout moments than any other American Analog Set album, but winds up feeling a bit less consistent as a result. That's a small price to pay, though, when you get songs like ""Million Young,"" with its brisk rhythm and buzzy organ, or ""Aaron & Maria,"" which aims to add another ""youngsters go off to the Big City"" chapter to the Great American Songbook. Warm, clean guitars surreptitiously sink monster hooks into your cerebellum as laid-back drums gently urge the song to its conclusion. There's something extremely admirable about music that demands to be heard by whispering, never rising to a clatter or resorting to petulant whining to attract attention. Instead, the American Analog Set create quietly engaging hymns that make you want to pay attention. If you should choose to ignore it because it's not making a racket, well, hey, that's more for me. Know by Heart ends pretty much exactly where it should, with the pulsing ""We're Computerizing and We Just Don't Need You Anymore."" Lyrically, the song holds an all-too-familiar tale of technology replacing heart, but the music is what really gets me. The band casts a glance back toward their old sound here, while inconspicuously inserting a cold synth low in the mix, suggesting that the band themselves may be headed into the brave new world on future releases. But even if that world doesn't yield rewards as pleasing as this, it will probably at least bare giving a listen to. In the meantime, Know by Heart will remain a warm, reliable source of calm in a loud, confusing world.","The American Analog Set make the kind of music that wraps around you like a home-knit sweater-- the sleeves may ...

The Sword of God,Quasi,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c2ea9e61561daa4891/1:1/w_160/af6dd7ee.gif,2001-09-07 06:01:40,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6614-the-sword-of-god/,Touch and Go,"Irony is kind of like butter. If something seems too dull or sugary, you put some butter on it to give its taste some semblance of body and depth. The butter tastes good, so you put on more butter. Soon, whatever tastes accompany the butter cease to matter. You just want more of that butter. Yummy, yummy butter. You refuse to acknowledge the value of anything that is non-buttery, insisting that it's trite and unsophisticated. ""Sugar is for kids,"" you shout, ""I want my goddamn butter!"" You begin to hate the sugar-eaters in all their smug simplicity. Everything you eat, and everything you cook, simply must have butter. It becomes a way of life. But it's not long before things start to go awry. Your friends get sick of you always forcing them to eat your buttery treats. While you can't get enough of it, it makes them feel sick and heavy. But you don't care-- they just don't understand the complex texture and full, rich body of butter. Friendless, you begin to sink into a state of depression. All those years immersed in butter have finally caught up with you, and its heaviness is beginning to wear on you. You've gained hundreds of pounds, and you can slowly feel your arteries hardening. Alone, bloated, and miserable, you die. You fucking die. Irony hasn't been clinically proven to lead to arteriosclerosis, but it does hold true that it's best when used sparingly and with great skill. Quasi has always been dear to me because they're one of the few bands that manages to lay the irony on thick without being too dark or pretentious. On Featuring ""Birds"", the juxtaposition of Sam Coomes' massive pop hooks and his bleak lyrical outlook seemed to blend together perfectly-- like a goofy-faced clown telling you that have lung cancer. Except even more perfect. The greatest part about Featuring ""Birds"" was that even if Coomes had been singing about happy elves prancing through fields of tall, green grass, the album would have rocked. The songs were just that good. Thankfully, the lyrics spread a message we could all relate to: life blows. But on the record's follow-up, 1999's Field Studies, the message remained unchanged, and without the brilliant, catchy, concise songs to back them up, the lyrics lost a lot of their punch. Without the songs, all you're left with is shtick. And shtick gets old pretty fast, as proven by the infuriatingly uneven The Sword of God. Like most bands that don't suck, Quasi is at their best when they sound like themselves. Yeah, I know, I know, bands should try to branch out in new directions and all that. But when a band succeeds in exploring new directions after already mastering one sound (which is beyond rare), they generally do so by bringing the better elements of their old sound into the new mix. If Quasi were to record a sprawling guitar rock album with hooks the likes of those on Featuring ""Birds,"" I would applaud my ass off. But this is not the case. Indeed, the best parts of The Sword of God are the parts that embrace Coomes' ability to write driving pop hooks. ""It's Raining"" features his trademark Roxichord swagger and a memorable, catchy melody. This is good. Sure, it sounds like the stuff on Featuring ""Birds,"" but this is compensated for by the fact that it's just really, really good. Slightly less infectious but similarly successful is ""A Case of No Way Out,"" a darker, more complex song that makes nice use of trademark indie rock boy-girl vocal arrangements without slipping into cloying inanity. These two songs both have their roots firmly planted in Quasi's pessimistic pop song tradition. Unfortunately, the efforts made by the band to expand their oeuvre on The Sword of God just fall flat. Long-winded instrumental passages, extended exploration of new instruments, and more bird noises do not a good record make, and The Sword of God makes this all too evident. Exploring new territory only pays off if you're comfortable with it and you have quality material to back it up. And that's usually not the case here. Still, one has to appreciate that Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss are still trying. If some of the new directions explored on The Sword of God had really great songs behind them, the resulting album could have been fantastic. But in keeping with the band's general outlook on life, their records just keep getting worse. Where's the butter in that?","Irony is kind of like butter.

Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth,His Name Is Alive,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0f0c0084474cd0c3272/1:1/w_160/cd587700.gif,2001-08-31 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3881-someday-my-blues-will-cover-the-earth/,4AD,"Over the last decade, Warn Defever has recruited an ever-changing assembly line of musicians to flesh out his mad, perverse fantasies under the His Name Is Alive moniker. All of his albums before 1996's Stars on ESP are out-of-print in the U.S., so it's hard to trace Defever (once Warren) back to his lo-fi goth-folk-ethnic-guitar-pop roots without paying over $20 for an import. What is available, therefore, is His Name Is Alive's evolutionary pattern over the past five years. Stars on E.S.P. was a dreamy, occasionally psychedelic pop record, toying with everything from stripped acoustic folk-pop to a complete structural replication of ""Good Vibrations""-- with a different melody and different lyrics altogether. It was also the last album to extensively feature the charmingly girlish Karin Oliver on lead vocals. 1998's Ft. Lake then subtly throttled fans with a full-on gutsy rock attack, although admittedly, it's nothing as fully straightforward as that; the entire record is peppered with synthesized oddities, not to mention a couple of trip-hop tracks to mix it up. Although Oliver made a few appearances on the record, soul vocalist Lovetta Pippen generally took the melodic reins. Then in '99, Defever had the gall to go off and release a solo record entitled I Want You to Live One Hundred Years, taking lo-fi to a new level by recording most of the old-timey yet original folk material to Edison wax cylinder. On the latest outing, Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth, His Name Is Alive consists solely of Warn Defever and Lovetta Pippen. How do we know? Well, it's simple really; they're the only two people who have photos on resident 4AD graphic artist Vaughan Oliver's gorgeously fitting artwork, not to mention a terribly cheesy pun to cement the notion: ""LOVE & WAR."" The record opens with Pippen's characteristic croon, but if you weren't told this were His Name Is Alive, it would take a while to guess that this music spilled from Defever's warped mind. Three quarters of Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth consist of a time warp back to the mid-90s, when slow-jam R&B; was innocent and carefree, while the rest is a mix between sparse ballads and a couple hints at traditional blues. Go back and read that again. No, wait, you don't have to. I'll just write it again: Carefree, mid-90s slow-jam R&B...; for which Warn Defever is responsible. Madness! Granted, it's not that much of a surprise that he's off doing something completely different. What is a surprise is that three years after a record of rootsy pop/rock, and only two years after a country-folk throwback, he's decided to take on Pippen for a collaboration and dive into a project of this particular genre. The curious thing is that they often succeed. It's quite a shame, then, that not every track is up to par. Ironically enough, a song called ""Nothing Special"" opens the collection by squandering the album's best material in its first four minutes. Defever's sparse acoustic arrangements and drum machine beats, characteristic of most of the album's remainder, work best around a gorgeous melody such as this one. Pippen's subdued, harmonized laments in the priceless chorus come off as earnestly touching: ""I've been in the storm so long/ Nothing special anymore/ Angel sings from another world/ That's all I hear anymore."" The only other success of this caliber comes later with ""One Year"", the previous version of which can be found in wax-cylinder folk-style on Defever's solo album. Truly funky wah-guitar, clavinet and reversed acoustic strumming are used to the track's advantage, making for a joyously indulgent breakdown in the coda. The rest of the R&B; excursions are pleasant enough, but as Pippen sang herself, nothing special. The melodies become a bit samey and, by the ending title track, appear somewhat hackneyed. The only other guilty pleasure of this dominant style is on the slightly over-long, slightly trip-hop ""Write My Name in the Groove"", in which Pippen sings, in a melody recalling Stars on E.S.P.'s more restrained moments, ""If I'm quiet, I can hear your heart/ When I'm up on ya."" The two other notable moments on Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth are a true 12-bar blues homage, enigmatically titled ""Karins Blues"", and a decelerated, beatless, acoustic version of ""Are We Still Married"", originally penned for the 1992 HNIA record Home Is in Your Head. The latter is the most beautiful moment on the record, with gently plucked acoustic guitar weaving in and out of haunting piano chords and string accompaniment as Pippen lends true emotion to the record's best lyrics: ""I'm kind of getting shot at/ I'm kind of getting hurt.../ This is your last life/ Take me where you want to go."" The ambition and daring that Warn Defever continually displays in his work, with His Name Is Alive and otherwise, is admirable. His willingness to plunge head-first into a foreign style shows his versatility and knowledge for creating authentic soundscapes of any kind, and his enthusiastic collaborative spirit is infectious as well. While I can't fully recommend Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth as an entirely successful release, I can fervently encourage a closer investigation into the rest of his brilliantly eccentric catalog, a look out for his upcoming work, and maybe even a second glance at this record just to see what he's up to now.","Over the last decade, Warn Defever has recruited an ever-changing assembly line of musicians to flesh out his mad, perverse ...

Vespertine,Björk,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c2b1335d7bf169857c/1:1/w_160/71b5be0f.jpg,2001-08-31 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/727-vespertine/,Elektra,"So this is it. The great follow-up to Homogenic we've anticipated since that overcast late-September afternoon in 1997 when we first sat listening to the album for the first time, wondering what she might do next. Somehow, it doesn't seem worth the wait. Homogenic, still the most innovative and substantial release of Björk's solo career, spilled over with rich melody and sybaritic imagery. Its dense, programmed percussion reflected IDM's infancy (The Richard D. James Album being a frequent point of comparison), yet submerged it in brooding Russian strings buoyed by thumping bass hits and Björk's urgent frustrations. The album's cavernous echoes and masterful arrangements sprang to larger-than-life proportions like the American musicals Selma fantasized about in Dancer in the Dark. Both cohesive and inconceivably modern, Homogenic sounded like the future-music of childhood dreams. While undeniably beautiful, Vespertine fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk's preceding albums. Rather than designing sounds never before imagined, the album merely sounds current, relying on the technology of standard studio software and the explorations of the Powerbook elite. There are few surprises here for the Björk fan, and fewer for the electro aficionado. Sure, it's nice to listen to, but it rarely challenges like Post's ""Enjoy"" and ""Headphones,"" or like Homogenic's ""Pluto."" And what's a Björk album without the ambush? That said, Vespertine has more than just a handful of charms. The record is gorgeously orchestrated with the Icelander's neon string sections, chiming music boxes, and intricately arranged background Björks. Its production, though never truly groundbreaking, is always beautifully executed with washes of harp, organic synthsounds and majestic, dreamlike effects. Björk hasn't lost her ability to create forested sonic otherworlds, or to achieve an overwhelmingly full sound while maintaining an air of wide, open space. In fact, it could be argued that, texturally, she has mastered her trademarks with this album. ""Hidden Place"" opens Vespertine with a glitchy, almost lo-fi melodic loop, paired with the deep sub-bass attack that has dominated the low-end of Björk's music in recent years. ""Aurora"" begins with rhythmic broomsweeps and awakens with delicate frosted chimes and angelic choirs. ""Heirloom"" alters between what sounds like a samba preset on a vintage Wurlitzer organ and skittering breakbeats, and is decorated with inverted synthtones and analog keyboards. And these songs, like all the others, are saturated in a thousand layers of whirling, grandiose strings and porcelain pings of fragile concordance. Yet, Vespertine is riddled with sameness, and the unshakable feeling that you've heard these songs before. And coated in such a delicious sheen, it's easy to miss that the music here lacks a major component of Björk's past recordings; strip Vespertine down to melody alone, and you're left with little substance. Only on occasion does Björk rise above the swelling symphonies and swirling digitalia with a memorable piece of music, and when she does, it seems fleeting. Perhaps it appears for a moment in the repetitious chorus of ""It's Not Up to You,"" or the album's shimmering closer, the Oval-sampling ""Unison."" But blink and you'll miss it, as it's invariably swallowed whole by the album's vast, ethereal instrumentation. Glitch wizards Matmos were called in during the Vespertine sessions to co-produce many of the record's tracks. I wonder where they are. Nowhere is their signature sound even remotely traceable. A theory: starstruck by Björk's iconic visage, they lent what they felt she would want, and left the experimenting to their own releases. Clearly, Björk realized that this duo was capable of inventing sounds beyond her wildest dreams, but the end result is typical; not exactly a rehash, but nevertheless predictable. Still, Vespertine makes for an intriguing listen, and manages to hold its own after hours on repeat. Were it not for the fact that Björk had already visited this terrain so reliably on previous outings, it could very well be her landmark achievement. But with the astounding Homogenic behind her, its melodies timelessly memorable and its production similarly captivating, Vespertine stands only as a pleasant journey back through her usual netherworld.","So this is it.

Weird Revolution,Butthole Surfers,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40bc0084474cd0c03ee/1:1/w_160/61c9e44c.gif,2001-08-31 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1043-weird-revolution/,Hollywood,"Hotshot rock album mixers hold an interesting position in the crafting of what musicians refer to as ""their art."" These are guys like Andy Wallace, Jack Joseph Puig, Butch Vig, Rob Cavallo, and Chris Lord-Alge that show up on 67% of all major label releases with theoretically ""powerful"" guitars. Rock mythology depicts them as old white guys with spiky shocks of Feria-dyed hair, PVC pants, artificial pumpkin-skin tans, shimmering shirts with hot-rod flames, and silver knuckle-jewelry. They sit behind beige sound boards with countless dials, levels, switches, and knobs, waiting for the latest Collective Soul, Toadies, Rehab, Offspring, or Harvey Danger master tapes to pass through. And you can't help but wonder-- these men having no true interest or input in the musical accomplishment already pressed within the ones and zeros of those DATs-- if, say, Lord-Alge hears the new Butthole Surfers album and mutters to himself, ""Sweet Jesus Fuck, this is awful."" Well, crack your bejeweled knuckles, Cavallo, because you have your work cut out for you. The Butthole Surfers, over their double-decade career, have proven, if little else, that perseverance, antics, and audacity count for a lot more than actual talent. They've never made a good record. Ever. You've likely heard the titles-- Hairway to Steven, Rembrant Pussyhorse, Locust Abortion Technician-- and chuckled at them. Perhaps you've seen the John Wayne Gacy cover art, or heard Dave Kendall spout ""Buh'ol Saafahs"" on ""120 Minutes"" circa 1991. Or maybe you've read about the court ruling in the case of B.H. Surfers v. Touch & Go's Corey Rusk, but you've never sat and listened to an album, have you? The albums have always been auxiliary to their feces'n'fire'n'fightin' live shows, Lollapalooza pioneering, commercial one-hit-wondering, and general personality of Gibby Haines and Paul Leary. Their best known album has no track titles and mentions scatology and farm animals repeatedly. They're Pere Ubu, Wesley Willis, the Dead Milkmen, and And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead rolled into one chaotic Texan mess. That is, they were, until ""Pepper"" and Disney. Weird Revolution, the Surfers' long-delayed follow-up to Electriclarryland, was originally meant to be After the Astronaut, but it was aborted in the final hour by Capitol Records. Its pop-western artwork would later show up on a Marcy Playground album. The Buttholes now call the Disney-owned Hollywood Records their home, and like Bubble Boy, the end product can only result in corporate heads rolling at Buena Vista. Weird Revolution exists only because the Butthole Surfers have mouths to feed, mortgages, and no other option in life. This is never the beginning of an essential album. In their increasing age and decreasing health, the Butthole Surfers no longer throw themselves around on stage, setting cymbals on fire, tearing apart sex dolls, and pissing on each other. These days, the off-record excitement has been reduced to a silly animated album cover, a CD-ROM, and Gibby Haines' ironic wearing of a Hanson t-shirt in press photos. He actually hates them! Or does he?! Irony upon irony upon irony. So what of the album? Bedrock tracks from Astronaut were reworked, filtered and mixed to sound ""of the moment."" Chris Lord-Alge's lacquer and radio-prescribed hum coats the record. The thin music seems to emanate from a TV you can't turn off. Each song putters on a weak beat that jangles and blips as if they dumped the ambient sounds of a Midway arcade over some Black Grape outtakes. ""Venus"" and ""Mexico"" flirt with Eastern sounds. It's as if you took Eastern Airlines to Eastern City in the heart of the Far East with nothing but some drugs and an English-to-Eastern dictionary to get by. ""God, Zeus, Allah, Buddha,"" Haynes says. ""Bob Dylan on a motor scooter."" It's about as surreal as a Lunchables commercial. The Butthole Surfers have finally become shocking only in their sheer banality, like a watered-down mix of the worst Beck and Perry Farrell material you can imagine. Two songs stand out as premeditated ""hits,"" in that they have verses, choruses, and the most names listed in the production credits. ""The Shame of Life"" lives up to its title by listing Kid Rock as a songwriter. You know this by the mention of ""girls,"" ""money,"" ""crack,"" and a ""loaded automatic."" Calculated guitar riffs fart in the chorus like a weak John Carpenter score. It has the potential of turning up on shock-jock modern radio, where you'll have to pay strict attention to discern whether it's a new Uncle Kracker tune or a Slim Jim ad. ""Dracula from Houston,"" the other ""featured hit"" (according to the sticker on the front-- Hollywood Records must be psychic!), opens with some bongos and the guitar line from ""Sweet Jane."" Gibby spits lazy rhymes like Anthony Kiedis before the song bursts into a massive Smash Mouth copy: ""Oh no/ We gotta go /We're not gonna live forever."" A fucking CG-animated donkey should be singing this. In hell. Exhibit #19,954 in the eternal, one-sided case of commercialism and aging v. art: Weird Revolution unintentionally lives up to its title by embodying the inexplicable surge of honky fratboy Jeep-beat rock that can't disappear soon enough.","Hotshot rock album mixers hold an interesting position in the crafting of what musicians refer to as ""their art.""

Tower in the Fountain of Sparks,Airport 5,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02d9d034d5c69bf2656/1:1/w_160/90a1bfc8.gif,2001-08-30 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/82-tower-in-the-fountain-of-sparks/,Rockathon,"If you were Bob Pollard, would you trust Tobin Sprout? Disregard, for a moment, the man's cutesy elfin name and the fact that, together, you've recorded a sizable portion of indie rock's canon with Sprout playing the trusty sideman, contributing a few songs to each album to push it towards the obligatory 20-track standard. Also take into account that when Guided by Voices went hi-fi, Sprout was left behind. Granted, Sprout left of his own accord, pursuing a more sedate artistic life away from your band's hectic touring schedule. But, even as he continued to release fine solo material, his circle of fame shrunk to a diehard core of GBVers while yours inched out into the public eye. Really, would you still trust him? Apparently, Tobin Sprout's not one to hold a grudge, despite the fact that Airport 5 would be the perfect place to air one. With Sprout recording all of album's instrumental tracks in Northport, Michigan (about 450 miles away from the Dayton hidey-hole where Pollard recorded the vocals), he finally had his chance to either upstage the man who'd been both John and Paul to his George by laying down flashy arrangements, or to sabotage him with flimsy backing. And since Pollard's too busy making albums to make albums, Sprout probably could've slipped it under the notoriously lax Pollard Quality Control Radar. But he didn't. And for a record created with such a vast distance between its creators, Tower in the Fountain of Sparks sounds remarkably cozy. Sprout seems especially careful not to step on Pollard's toes here, plugging away on most of the tracks with dour, persistent strumming and a few unadorned rock beats. Still, he's not afraid to add some sparkle, stitching jangly leads into this burlap canvas. Sprout's slide guitar, a new addition since his GBV days, spills across ""Subatomic Rain"" and ""Up the Nails"" in slow, mournful rivulets, and his fluid, bouncy basswork on ""Total Exposure"" even out-meanders Pollard's melodic lines. And yes, he's finally discovered that four-tracks record backwards as well as forwards. ""The Cost of Shipping Cattle"" begins in a cacophony of reversed guitars, then sorts itself out into a gorgeous, softly swelling tune. Considering the arena-rock aspirations Pollard has developed since his days in the old GBV, it's oddly appropriate that he almost sounds like an arena-rocker trying to go lo-fi here. This means that some of the songs' quirks-- like the drunken shout-alongs in the otherwise pristine pop beauty of ""Circle of Trim""-- sound a bit artificial. And along with its familiar veneer of reverb and British affectations, Pollard's croon seems even more over-the-top than ever in places, adding embellishments to the some of the nigh-infinitely repeated choruses and breaking into falsetto ta-ta-ta's on ""Feathering Clueless."" But those are just the parts of the whole. Even when separated by interstate commerce laws and the icy depths of Lake Michigan, Pollard and Sprout have the ability to sound like a band. A real band. In the space of this mostly noise-free record, Pollard and Sprout form their own feedback loop: Pollard's singing gives lift to Sprout's gently melancholy music, while Sprout gives weight to Pollard's abstracted exuberance. This, combined with Pollard's recent discovery that it occasionally makes sense to make sense (if only just in the choruses) gives Tower in the Fountain of Sparks a sort of emotional weight rare for a GBV-related project. As Sprout's acoustic guitars hum like a darkening summer night behind ""Total Exposure,"" Pollard couches his simplest, most comfortingly pedestrian imagery ever in a perfect melodic lilt: ""Listen to the way the children play/ As the day slips away/ And the light comes on."" Though the hard-rocking ""One More"" and the elliptical ""Mission Experiences"" can be chalked up as the inevitable slight missteps, the album hits its stride halfway through. ""Stifled Man Casino"" channels its frustration (""You can feel all the dust in your window/ You can feel all the lust in your mind/ But you can't have what you want"") into upbeat, playful pop, while ""Up the Nails"" turns the same sentiment (""How can you believe/ That patience brings reward?"") into slow-burning sadness. ""Tomorrow You May Rise"" sounds like one of GBV's random fragments turned strangely complete, thanks only to Sprout's well-placed synthesizer and another moment of lyrical lucidity (""Stand up crying, don't bend/ You are not lost in the present/ Tomorrow you may rise""). Elsewhere, ""Feathering Clueless"" provides more simple, slightly sad pop, and Sprout's slow, stately instrumentation on ""Mansfield in the Sky"" is almost impossibly gorgeous. Towards the record's end, the haunting solo Sprout track, ""White Car Creek,"" bleeds gracefully into the closer, ""Remain Lodging (At Airport 5)"". Buoyed by effervescent treated pianos, Pollard preaches acceptance and stability, with a smirking allusion to relationship trouble (""It's hard to be a bird in a flying house/ It's how to be a drone/ In a hive of women"") that puts a warm spin on the album's melancholy bent. It's indicative of how, even though they were just starting to make it big in music when their peers were making their final mortgage payments, Pollard and Sprout are still maturing. As if they could do something like this every day; wake up in the morning, grab a lunchbox, go their separate ways, and at the end of the day, climb back into the welcoming, familiar embrace of their four-tracks, where all will be right with the world.","If you were Bob Pollard, would you trust Tobin Sprout?

All This Sounds Gas,Preston School of Industry,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12313d1975652138568/1:1/w_160/c7e2944d.gif,2001-08-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6462-all-this-sounds-gas/,Matador,"Anyone that found themselves coming of age to the sound of early 90s indie rock has a place in their heart for Pavement. Go to any ID show at your local music venue, mention the band's revered name to a stranger, and make a friend for life. But ask virtually any 16-year-old indie newcomer about Pavement's impact on their lives and record collections, and reach the bitter realization that what was once so fresh and utterly indispensable now merely passes with an ""eh."" The kids are never quick to dismiss Pavement, as the band is, and likely always will be, heralded among the founding fathers of independent rock as we know it. But somehow, the magic that once made them so vital and potent has faded with age, and just doesn't seem quite as relevant in these high-powered times as it did ten years ago. When Pavement came along with Slanted and Enchanted in 1991, it seemed a revelation: so vastly different from anything before it, and so clearly prescient of everything that would come after. Stephen Malkmus' lazy, pitch-imperfect California drawlin', Spiral Stairs' shredded almost-guitar-playing, and the album's seemingly unfinished half-songs encapsulated the slacker ethos of the time with the hyperactive, restless energy that only hits after long bouts with boredom. Pavement's stream-of-consciousness lyrics and one-take anthems achieved genius through apathy. And in a time when apathy seemed the only option in life, no one said everything by saying nothing at all like those bored Stocktonites. These days, the kids have ambition, and rightfully so. America's flush with cash and prizes, and for once, there's actual opportunity. In this age, when kids come barreling out of high school with enough computer experience to put Nolan Bushnell to shame, indifference would simply be retarded. And the current climate of independent music reflects that with bands like Sigur Rós, Godspeed You Black Emperor and Mogwai who, while all somewhat dreary at times, seem driven by an intense passion to be the best at what they do. Yes, time advances for everyone, it seems. Everyone except Scott Kannberg. Despite Pavement's demise, Kannberg still hangs on tightly to his Spiral Stairs alias, a name which seems an inside joke so closely affiliated with Pavement that it's hard to see how it could exist outside the band. Even the name of the new group he's formed with members of the Moore Brothers (a duo who finds their home on his Amazing Grease label), the Preston School of Industry, is a waning reference to an early Pavement song. It's also undoubtedly another inside joke between Pavement members, as the actual Preston School is a detention and re-education center for juvenile delinquents in Ione, California, just over 40 miles from Pavement's hometown. The music on the Preston School of Industry's debut album, All This Sounds Gas, revels in early 90s alterna-rock, a sound so exhausted it now sounds at least as generic as its equally banal predecessor, freedom rock. The only thing separating the Preston School from the Gin Blossoms is their well-worn Pavement edge. Even so, Pavement's rough-hewn absurdities have been blent with more conventional pop structures by bedroom wannabes for the past decade; the fact that the Preston School is fronted by an ex-member of the band doesn't make their music any less of a mimicry. Three of the album's tracks were written by Kannberg during the sessions for Pavement's swan-song, 1999's Terror Twilight, including the record's lead-off, ""Whalebones,"" which starts the album off nicely with the kind of lazy, repetition-based melody that should sound familiar to any Pavement addict. But while a pleasant listen, all of the youthful exuberance Kannberg displayed on his Pavement tracks-- even ones as late as Brighten the Corners' ""Date w/IKEA""-- has totally evaporated, and where the song should burst into a fiery distortion overdrive, it's content to meander on and peter out with no sign of actual effort. ""The Idea of Fires"" and the seven-minute long ""Encyclopedic Knowledge of,"" both also written in the Terror Twilight days, never seem to gain direction or rise above I-could-do-that mediocrity. While these three tracks seem passable at best, they're never downright offensive. But the uninspired country twang of ""A Treasure @ Silver Bank (This Dynasty's for Real)"" crosses that line. Senseless lyrics like, ""It's a polyester bright day now/ And the dinosaurs are for real,"" and, ""50 minutes till the muses needs/ Put you out to the trees,"" just sound so fucking wrong against the vagabond Travis Tritt backdrop. And a half-hour later, the album closes at its worst with the neverending ""Take a Stand,"" a pale Soft Bulletin imitation whose hackneyed, off-kilter beat stumbles awkwardly underneath 11,000 layers of acoustic guitar and a chorus of inept la-la-la's before the song closes with a voice proclaiming it ""a brilliant rock odyssey."" All This Sounds Gas might not have been such a weak effort if Kannberg's lyrics actually had anything to say, but nonsense prose has never meshed well with jangly, country-inflected pop. The album also might have improved, however slightly, if they'd left off the embarrassing quasi-experimental keyboard jam, ""Blü Sön,"" a 44-second excursion to Planet Shame that makes the Byrds' ""Moog Raga"" seem like a monolith of pulsing electronic genius. But, of course, they didn't, leaving All This Sounds Gas to languish in future obscurity as yet another post-legendary project that fails to live up to its frontman's glory days.

Circulatory System,Circulatory System,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5dac0084474cd0c0803/1:1/w_160/2e315c50.gif,2001-08-28 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1478-circulatory-system/,CloudCloud,"When you're dreaming, time becomes fluid. The steady, firmly ingrained progression of seconds, minutes, and hours breaks from its linear, unilateral form to allow for drastic changes in magnitude and direction. Hours can slink by with no conscious recollection of the passage of time, and seemingly infinite journeys can occur within the span of a few minutes. Several different things can exist in the same place at the same time, and within the context of your dream, it always seems to make perfect sense. You're never surprised when you've traveled from one end of the earth to the other in a couple of seconds-- the change in the nature of time alters not only your surroundings, but your perception of them as well. This, the self-titled debut from Olivia Tremor Control mastermind Will Cullen Hart, is one of the few albums I've heard that can effectively blur the line between real-world time and dream-world time. With its illusory, ethereal production, wistful melodies, and oft-funereal pace, this is one of those rare albums that can completely absorb you in such a way as to almost dissolve the world around you, and make you feel like you've been transported to another realm of existence within the course of 58 minutes. While not an Olivia Tremor Control release by name, there are very few elements here that will be unfamiliar to fans of the band. Aside from Bill Doss, just about everyone who's ever contributed to an OTC release is present, making for a grand total of 21 musicians involved in its making. Given the sheer volume of people contributing, and Cullen Hart's history with layering sound, it's no surprise that Circulatory System is a sonically dense album. But here, more than on any Olivia Tremor Control record, Cullen Hart displays an almost supernatural talent for melding these sounds into a single entity that is absolutely enveloping, and for shaping that entity around a powerful melody. In some ways, the absence of Bill Doss seems to be a blessing, turning the once-Olivia sound inward as Hart is left to explore his own lyrical and sonic ruminations on time, death, and the nature of humanness. Initially, Circulatory System sounds remarkably dark. Mournful percussion, ambiguous and ominous noises, and minor chords galore conjure vague, hazy images of death and sorrow. The upbeat, pop/rock of the Olivia Tremor Control, showcased on songs like ""The Opera House"" from Dusk at Cubist Castle and Black Foliage's ""A New Day,"" has all but evaporated. But in its place stands some of the most deeply reflective psychedelic music ever laid to tape. ""Inside Blasts"" serves as perhaps a perfect archetype of Cullen Hart's new direction. Opening with only accordion and his muffled voice, the song gradually builds with stereo banjos, Dirty Three-style violins, and sparse drumming. Fuzzed-out bass enters the fray, alongside eerie tones that could best be described as what a music box might sound like if it were made out of a coffin. Sounds are added so subtly that they almost become subliminal, sinking deeply into the folds of your brain without necessarily registering any kind of conscious reaction. And when a change is substantial enough to make you take notice, its impact is greatly intensified by the minute variations surrounding it. A little more than halfway into ""Inside Blasts,"" many of the elements that have built up over the course of the song suddenly cut out, as layers of vocal harmony and odd percussive noises are introduced. It's a near-perfect sonic approximation of sadness and beauty, and without question one of the album's best moments. Another high point comes with ""Yesterday's World,"" the album's opener and possibly its most direct, poppy track. Fuzzy guitars, layered horns, and trashy tambourines back up one of the best melodies Cullen Hart has ever penned. But even ""Yesterday's World"" has a strong undercurrent of philosophical reflection and melancholy to it. As Cullen Hart questions, ""Can we go back in time/ Can we bring, can we bring, can we bring these days,"" the instruments backing him slowly fade out, leaving only his increasingly uncertain-sounding voice. Indeed, nagging uncertainty seems to be one of many thematic threads that help make Circulatory System such a cohesive, affecting album. The record's closer, ""Forever,"" consists only of the words, ""We will live forever and you know it's true,"" sung in a disturbing, otherworldly melody by Cullen Hart and Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum, as well as a slew of others. By far the most haunting moment on the album, ""Forever"" is the sound of a campfire singalong of long-forgotten ghosts, lamenting the infinite loneliness of eternal life. As ""Forever"" fades out, reality slowly begins to creep back in. The sounds, words, and voices on Circulatory System linger as a memory, but not as a memory of an album. Bits and pieces of melodies refuse to leave you, and you find yourself listening to the record over and over again to see if the vaporous melodies are real, or just figments of your imagination. You listen seeking comfort, but find only more depth in the album's uncertainty. Like a dream, you can never shake the feeling that your memory of Circulatory System is never quite the same as the original. Unlike a dream, you can revisit that original as many times as you wish.",,9.5,
Sound-Dust,Stereolab,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5609d034d5c69bf32af/1:1/w_160/071a7d39.jpg,2001-08-28 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7494-sound-dust/,Elektra,"As the legend goes, Stereolab bettlerharfemensch Tim Gane met the devil himself one dark night in the curved corners of Rem Koolhaas' Educatorium at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands. On this night, the devil did not materialize in his traditional red spandex bodysuit, nor did he hold a pitchfork. Instead, he came fat, balding, and wearing nothing but a white stuffed bunny over his groin area. Ol' Scratch made a proposition: in exchange for Gane's soul, he would teach him to play the slide guitar like no man before him. For an extra toe, the Dark Prince even threw in a vintage theremin. It was there, in the gut of the building's cement swooshes and glass walls, that he and the devil struck a pact. For the cost of eternal damnation, Tim Gane became the greatest Delta Kraut player in history. In seedy Dutch mussel joints, ""Nine Toes Tim"" played, drank, fought, and eventually lost his life to a poisoned trappist ale left by a scorned lover. But not before cutting his legacy into the scratchy vinyl of records he recorded for a nickel a piece at Stereolab Studios-- nickels he drunkenly swore to put towards ""booze, minimalist furniture, and womens."" At the time, ""race"" records, as they were unenlightenedly referred to, became a hot commodity in European cities, and no race records were more popular than those German ones from the northern flatlands. Now, decades later, after his original audiences have passed away (save for those few freaks of health), it is impossible to accurately judge Tim Gane's contemporary importance. For a man so intoxicated by his own debauchery, Gane recorded an ungodly massive amount of music. He surrounded himself with regular Stereolab session players such as Mary ""Big Baba"" Hansen and Laetitia ""Blind Marxist"" Sadier, who filled out the sounds with organs, chimes, vocals, vibes, beats, keys, and sundry other tweeting French instruments. Oddly enough, despite his deal with Satan, Gane put his slide guitar to tape only once, on this record you hold now in your hands, Sound-Dust. Restored from its original ""compact disc"" release, Sound-Dust, though it likely came late in Stereolab's existence, towers, however slightly, over a majority of Gane's oeuvre like the cartoon rampart on its cover. Out of context and sequence, Sound-Dust remains a lasting testament to the spirit of the Delta Kraut. Historians have linked Gane's music to the shadowy music of Delta Kraut originators Neu, a wandering duo who regularly played their hypnotic grooves up and down the Rhine for steamboating vacationers. And in fact, Gane's critical contemporaries often dismissed his output as mere Neu mimicry. ""Jah, vhatevs, zey are just neu Neu,"" they would say, laughing at their own tepid humor. But rocking in his Ikea tuuti chair on a brushed aluminum porch, the level-headed Gane would simply mutter in response, ""When you gots the kraut, you gots the kraut. You don't play the kraut. You feels the kraut."" His dismissal from such criticism is just, as Neu! reissues illuminate. Though Neu's rhythmic elements flow directly in to Stereolab's output, Stereolab album were far more detailed and lush affairs. Inarguably, there are traces of their kraut forefathers on all Stereolab records, but they lie under twenty additional layers of piano, woodwinds, and harmonies. An animal certainly should not be compared to the fossilized skeleton of its predecessors. Take the Sound-Dust tracks ""Gus the Mynah Bird"" and ""Nothing to Do with Me,"" songs which ostensibly motor on Neu fuel. Melting horns, a lovely verbal indignation of military, space-out reverb flashes in the coda, and a slight hiccup and stutter in the beat go beyond the call of kraut's duty. Neu, and the rest of kraut's figures, never reached such absinthe-hazed detail. The ancient critics decried, ""Ach, they are still just Neu meeting the Beach Boys, Bacharach and Gainsbourg."" There was some truth in this; ""Naught More Terrific Than Man"" undeniably lounges on the smooth brass, martini vibes, and latent sexuality of Bacharach and Gainsbourg, and drizzles the most demented moments of the Beach Boys. However, those ingredients had never been baked together with such studious precision and Rhine Delta soul. Gane devoted his life to Teutonic toots and trips and Frano fun when most other figures had either eroded away or moved on to music for the harbors of their primitive flying machines. The trademark sounds of Stereolab-- incessant tintinnabulation, endless brittle grooves, decorative fluttering fluff, studio swirls, modulating bass, and flat, hiply disinterested female vocals-- drench Sound-Dust, but variety, timing, and focus sharpen the album, making this particular simmering stew more palatable than previous recordings. The ingredients are not vastly different than the preceding Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night, but that album seemed a befuddling galaxy of a mess due to its sequencing and timing, which centered around the plodding maw of the 11\xBD-minute ""Blue Milk."" Sound-Dust, on the other hand, ebbs, shifts, dips and morphs just when it needs to, and at times, slight moments before you expect it to. It contains more kinds of keyboarded instruments, and more kinds of xylophonic instruments, and more kinds of brass instruments, and more kinds of dizzying effects. And on ""The Black Arts,"" in a rare moment of emotion, Laetitia Sadier's wunderbaritone vocals and lyrics actually become the crux. That is, until chunky drums and cyclones of harpsichord spool the groove around her neck. ""Space Moth"" rides the highway lines of bass into the horizon, but suddenly burps into the most tuneful pop-- modeled on an actual hook. Yet, ""Captain EasyChord,"" Sound-Dust's first single, dominates the album only three tracks in. Gane's slide guitar slices through layers of plucks and bops with melodic acuity. Here, Stereolab is the sweetheart of the kraut-rodeo, until the song unexpectedly skips into a Gates of Dawn-era Pink Floyd whistle-along. Gane's slide-guitar briefly appears again in the PCP poi of ""Double Rocker."" Simply dismiss it as lounge, and miss out on the rich, gentle mindmelt. At their time of release, each Stereolab album was touted as ""the only one you really need."" Sound-Dust stakes claim to this proclamation, but more importantly, proves that Stereolab indeed have two, maybe three albums you really need. So go ahead. If legend and Christian dogma hold true, Gane is burning in hell for this.","As the legend goes, Stereolab bettlerharfemensch Tim Gane met the\n\ devil himself one dark night in the curved corners ...

White Blood Cells,The White Stripes,by: Dan Kilian & Ryan Schreiber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa18c0084474cd0c1141/1:1/w_160/b39a21f4.jpeg,2001-08-23 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8651-white-blood-cells/,Sympathy for the Record Industry,"It's been a long time since I've wanted to hear an album every day, let alone more than once a day. Sure, to make these review deadlines, I often have to listen to a record daily, but in so many cases, it's a chore. That's not a problem with White Blood Cells. In fact, the problem now is finding time for the next album to review; all I want to do is listen to the White Stripes. I've got it taped for my walkman in the classic cassette format-- it fits easily onto Side A of my 90-minute Maxell. I keep wasting precious battery power fast-forwarding through Side B so I can get back to White Blood Cells. I love the rock and roll. There's always someone new coming along, taking that heavily rooted sound-- the music of the Gods-- and making the old beast sing anew. It's Christ and Prometheus, eternally dying and rising again. Jack and Meg White summon the Holy Spirit and channel it through 16 perfectly concise songs of longing, with dirty, distorted electric guitar cranked to maximum amplification, crashing, bruised drums, and little else. They don't innovate rock; they embody it. And whatever past form of the genre White Blood Cells invokes has been given a makeover and set loose to strut the lower east side's back alleys in its new clothes. Red and white clothes. (The Stripes could stand to vary the color schemes of their album covers.) There's no denying that the White Stripes fall within the confines of the garage rock band. Their music is simple, stripped down and it howls the blues. But despite its simplicity, there's something here that goes so much deeper. Jack White's mangled guitar screams like a rabid catfight, its strings massacred to the point of snapping. Meg White's kit is bashed with such force you'd imagine her as some kind of incredible hulk, though in photos, she appears the prototypical indie girl-- waifish, with pigtails and a nasty smirk. Yet she whips all of her 98 pounds into a tornadic fury like E. Honda's hundred-hand slap. Occasionally, Jack tosses an organ into the mix, or bangs on a piano like the Stones' Ian Stewart. But for the most part, White Blood Cells is instrumentally sparse, with only a guitar and drums. The last time I recall such a dense sound being wrung from rock's bare essentials was on Liz Phair's similarly Stones-inspired Exile in Guyville, though this record explores much raunchier sonic textures; rather than Phair's restrained but biting wit, Jack White opts to lay it all on the line, the unfiltered cynicism of an intelligent mind sent blaring through 1000 Hz of raw aggression. White Blood Cells surges with classic rock's grittier moments, stomping around like the MC5 and, on the instrumental ""Aluminum,"" Sabbath. The guitar echoes the second half of Neil Young's Rust Never Sleeps. But Jack's vocals are pure indie rock-- bratty and unashamedly so-- and in his upper register, his voice yowls and cracks with pissed adolescence. Virtually all of these songs address a distanced lover. Sometimes he's coming home to see her; other times she's done him some permanent wrong. The lyrics are succinct and direct, and poetic like an aged bluesman. On ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground,"" he sings: ""If you can hear a piano fall, you can hear me coming down the hall/ If I could just hear your pretty voice, I don't think I'd need to see at all."" He concludes the song with, ""Any man with a microphone can tell you what he loves the most/ And you know why you love at all if you're thinking of the Holy Ghost."" On the country hootenanny ""Hotel Yorba,"" the Stripes reflect the grit of early Railroad Jerk-- a glee-filled boogie with Jack's voice breaking and whooping, almost on the verge of a yodel. ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" is frenzied and rollicking (the album's best), complete with Yardbirds-type ""ahhaa's"" and a joi de vivre tempered by the admission that trouble is sure to follow: ""My left brain knows that all love is fleeting."" Indeed, many of the songs admit that the love is lost. On ""The Union Forever,"" Jack White mourns, ""It can't be love/ Because there is no love."" The song is a riff on Citizen Kane, including a strange breakdown with sampled dialogue from the film. Here, the White Stripes are the most experimental they get, which is to say ""not very,"" though the song reminds me of the ragged power of Royal Trux without the pointless artiness. Certainly, it would be nice to hear the White Stripes take this music in a new direction, but this band is all about the songs, and the songs are good enough to stand alone, sans-flashy effects and tape editing. ""The Same Boy You've Always Known"" is another high point. For a ballad, it rocks harder than most bands' hard-rockers, yet it wrenches in its emotional impact. Jack White repeats certain key lines, straining his voice to impart meaning and feeling. Again, the state of the relationship in question is uncertain. The song ends uncommitted and terribly sad with, ""If there's anything good about me/ I'm the only one who knows."" How many bands have failed with entire albums of moroseness to only express the alienation of those two lines? The closest thing to a dud on this record is ""We're Going to Be Friends,"" a gentle, nostalgic ditty of innocent love and childhood. It's a little too pleasant, lacking any of the fear and confusion of those pre-double-digit years, but its softness gives the record's midpoint some time to inhale before another six exhalations of fire. Finally, at the close of the album, Jack sits alone at the piano for ""This Protector."" Though its message is vague, there are implications of religion and loss: ""You thought you heard a sound/ There's no one else around/ 300 people out in West Virginia/ Have no idea of all these thoughts that lie within you/ But now... now... now, now, now, NOW!"" Now what? It's the floating resonance of the moment, the intensity of the feeling, that gives these words meaning. White Blood Cells doesn't veer far from the formula of past White Stripes records; all are tense, sparse and jagged. But it's here that they've finally come into their own, where Jack and Meg White finally seem not only comfortable with the path they've chosen, but practiced, precise and able to convey the deepest sentiment in a single bound. It's hard to know at this point in the game where they'll head from here, but what matters is right now. And right now, I want to listen to this album again.","It's been a long time since I've wanted to hear an album every day, let alone more than ...

Bleed American,Jimmy Eat World,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba015e6ef95969322acb/1:1/w_160/4bae3d68.gif,2001-08-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4261-bleed-american/,Dreamworks,"Are you a 15-year-old TRL addict looking for a step up from Sum 41 and American Hi-Fi? Something you can connect to on an emotional level that won't sacrifice that mindless accessibility you've been force-fed all your life? You liked the new Weezer album, didn't you? Well, this is like that, but better! Never will Jimmy Eat World venture into ""too much information"" territory like that Rivers what's-his-name and his ""Hash Pipe."" You want love, happiness and ""whoa's."" You want to cruise around the housing development with the windows down, doing donuts in the cul-de-sac with your newly obtained permit, blasting music so empty and sincere even you could have written it. You're getting to the age now when you're bored a lot. You're angry. You're frustrated with it all. All of it! You hate it! You hate this life, you hate your friends, you hate yourself. Why can't it just be fun, like when you were a kid? Something needs to speak to you, but not speak really hard or anything like that. After all, you weren't put on this earth to think! Well, Jimmy Eat World are there for you. They don't think, either! These guys are the best friends you can imagine. They know what you're going through, and they care. They care like a million hearts wrapped up inside a teddy bear holding a bouquet of understanding in one hand and an undying torch of reassurance in the other. They keep the flame of rock alive while giving you advice about the most important thing in your world: yourself. Their new album, Bleed American, is the best at that. Lead singer Jim Adkins reels off lyric after insightful lyric, facing you with tough questions like, ""Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back lookin' around?"" and ""Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out?"" Serious words, my friend. You better consider what this guy is saying, 'cause you ""gotta make a move or you'll miss out."" He's right! If you don't make a move, whatever that might be, you'll miss out on whatever you might miss out on, and that could be anything! You don't want to miss out, do you? The best thing about Bleed American is that all of the songs sing directly to you. These guys don't fuck around with any of that storytelling, third-person bullshit. You are misunderstood, goddamnit, and when your friends aren't there for you, Jimmy Adkins always will be, rockin' out while lifting your self-esteem: ""Hey, don't write yourself off yet,"" he sings on ""The Middle."" ""It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on/ Just try your best/ Try everything you can/ And don't you worry what they tell themselves/ When you're away."" I'm seriously gonna cry! That really hits home. And the music. Whoa. Don't even get me started! These songs will never test you or judge you. Every song is as straight-on as you can get, filled with the power of distorted, chugging guitars, pummeling 4/4 drums, and bass playing so precise it could be programmed. There are no fancy production tricks or effects, just four chords of awesome pop music. Plus, their acronym is JEW. That's funny! But Jimmy Eat World don't rock all the way through Bleed American. They know exactly when to slow it down for that heart-wrenching, sentimental ballad: track six! ""Hear You Me"" is the song you'll cry yourself to sleep with when you get a B+ on your science paper, or your girlfriend tells you she ""needs some space."" The song is really about the death of a friend, so it will help the tears come when you need them most. Adkins quietly intones the saddest words ever put to paper: ""And if you were with me tonight/ I'd sing to you just one more time/ A song for a heart so big/ God wouldn't let it live."" Now I really am gonna cry! Yes, it's definitely time to grow up. Rites of passage are coming, if they haven't already-- sex, heartbreak, the loss of everything you own in a housefire, birth defects, and genocide... or at least things that seem that big! So do the best you can, listen to your favorite band, bury your head in the sand, before it all begins again. Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat World song!","Are you a 15-year-old TRL addict looking for a step up from Sum 41 and American Hi-Fi? Something you can ...

Gizmodgery,Self,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a1c0084474cd0c02e7/1:1/w_160/43e44136.jpeg,2001-08-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7067-gizmodgery/,SpongebathSpongebath,"Gizmodgery was recorded using only toy instruments. There. Now we can conduct our serious record criticism like adults. After all, upon hearing Gizmodgery a few times, I've come to the conclusion that Self (aka Matt Mahaffey) could have ditched the schtick and recorded this, his fourth release, with a couple guitars, a few synthesizers, a drumkit and a decent sampler for all I care. Besides, now that we know what he was going for, we might as well realize that Mahaffey's only trying to distract you from the fact that not much else separates this record from the rest of the pack. There's nothing that screams ""unique"" about this music. In fact, it could be pigeonholed into the mundane category of ""quirky pop,"" or at best, into one of quirky pop's vague subdivisions. And I defy you to listen to this record without being reminded of other artists. I know I couldn't. At the start of each new song, I'd add another artist to my mental Artists Self Has Been Influenced By list. You can see how that might serve as a distraction. He covers ""What a Fool Believes,"" for Christ's sake, and without even bringing anything interesting to it. What's the point? Okay, one more thing, and then we can get to the good part of the record. Mahaffey's love of noise and clutter seems to act as an excuse for running low on decent ideas. Clear examples lie in the intro to ""5 Alive"" and the entire following song, ""Chameleon."" In the case of the latter, Matt offers a booming drum loop and some distorted noises, along with a repetitive, nonsensical vocal line. The only break in the song is the bridge, which features a sample of some drunk guy yammering. Only melody-- or silence-- would have provided sufficient relief. Gizmodgery's strong point comes when Mahaffey starts actually having fun. The album's kickoff, ""I Am a Little Explosion,"" is a perfect introduction; it's one of the strongest tracks, exuding the kind of childish, exuberant energy that one might expect from a toy-lover. ""Dead Man"" is a marvelous slice of power pop, trading off programmed beats and a synthesized harpsichord progression with a Rentals-esque, power-chord-laden chorus. ""Ordinaire"" kicks new wave ass, recalling Devo with alarm sounds, wacky guitar lines, and caffeine-fueled hyperactivity. And ""Miracleworker"" gives me the perfect chance to make the obligatory Beck comparison (and by Beck, I'm talking about Odelay-era Beck), which, in this case, ain't so much a bad thing. But the highlight of the album is ""Trunk Fulla Amps,"" which has been clearly designated as a single (yeah, wishful thinking, fella) with the inclusion of a radio edit after the final track. The gist of the song: ""Got a trunk fulla amps, motherfucker,"" ad infinitum. But while that may seem weak in print, he sings it with an infectious glee unrivaled by the rest of the record. Verse by verse, Mahaffey trades off emulating his heroes (Queen, ELO... Danzig?), a sign of his wry sense of humor finally working to his advantage. And the instrumental bridge is simply beautiful, an unexpected but somehow perfect transition into a smooth Brazilian-flavored interlude on subtly rhythmic guitar and an uptempo bossanova beat. Mahaffey has never made a cohesive record. Clearly, though, like all his past efforts, the potential to craft a strong pop song around a catchy hook is there, and it shines through the mediocrity. If only he were more selective in his album-crafting process, then perhaps we'd have a Self record we could thoroughly enjoy. It might take a little longer, but hell, I'd wait.","Gizmodgery was recorded using only toy instruments.

Through the Age of Quarrel and into the Era of Putting Up with It,American Heritage,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07f13d19756521383d3/1:1/w_160/e700baa9.gif,2001-08-18 06:01:40,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/161-through-the-age-of-quarrel-and-into-the-era-of-putting-up-with-it/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Gentlemen. Oh. And ladies, too-- it's nice to see some of you finally joining our ranks. But let's get down to business. For months on end now, people have been spinning wild, implausible rumors about our as-yet-unreleased and super-top-secret product, codenamed ""Ginger."" There are rumors that it's some sort of nuclear-powered scooter, which, if you care to take a look at the plans, you'll see is clearly off-base. And General Mills and Sony, you can rest assured that we're not ""horning in"" on your Taste-o-Vision project. No, I'm afraid none of the above-- all exciting and ahead-of-their-time concepts, mind you, that we at Troubleman Unlimited would be interested in developing, given the proper economic backing-- are Ginger. But we like to think that the real Ginger is just as futuristic and vital to consumer needs as any of those products. Ahh. I'm getting ahead of myself. You all came here with one question smoldering in your skulls: ""What, essentially, is this exciting new Ginger product, and how can I get my hands on one?"" Well, I'll tell you. Ginger is-- well, Ginger is, umm... a hardcore album. Shocking, isn't it?! Daring, eh? A group of three terribly bright young kids calling themselves American Heritage (and I just can't tell you how refreshing it is to see the youth expressing an interest in their country) developed the album for us, which, because of the horribly unwieldy title they gave it, was redesignated by our PR department as ""Ginger."" Now, I know some of you are saying, ""Wait a minute-- I already own a hardcore album. Maybe even more than one hardcore album! Why do I need Ginger?"" You don't know the half of it. Let's take her for a ""test drive,"" as it were. First, check out the vocals. Hear any? Well, disregard that first track, where a computerized voice recites some rather ""lowbrow"" jokes aimed at the band members to the tune of ""God Save the Queen""-- just our boys' way of making the product a bit more ""user-friendly"" (though we think we'll have to ax that feature in the final version, as the unintelligible voice makes the humor a bit unfunny, as they say). But otherwise, no singing! The future, I say! Have you ever listened to ""techno"" music, the kind they make on computers? Not much singing there, either! Trust me: ten years from now, people will be singing up to 75% less than they do today! Plus-- and be honest with yourself here-- you've never really ""dug"" that hardcore singing style. Those guys sound like they're crazy! And all that screaming distracts from the natural beauty of the music. Am I right? Well, with Ginger, you don't have to deal with that junk anymore! Now, I know that when you listen to new-school hardcore, you think, ""Sure, there are lots of tempo and time changes. But darn it all, I want more!"" Well, now, cool down for a second. Just take a listen to Ginger. See? You can go for minutes without hearing a multiple of four! Ginger can handle the most arcane time signatures imaginable. In fact, that's almost all it does! And if you're getting bored with that 9/4 rhythm, don't worry; it's sure to change in a few seconds. I'm sure you're all wondering how our boys at American Heritage managed this. Well, they've got a secret, and it's something so brilliant I can't believe no one's ever tried it before. You see, Ginger almost never establishes a solid beat! That's right, it's nearly incapable! Even at slower tempos, they just can't do it. Listen to how they just kind of trail off at the end of about half of the measures. Genius! I know questions have been raised about why this doesn't make all of those time changes moot, and those are excellent questions that I will, in fact, address at some point in the distant future. Allow me to digress for a second to tell you a bit more about our American Heritage team. These kids sure know how to play their instruments, and a few of the individual sections of these songs are quite nice, but that's not where their true genius lies. See, they're up on the market research. They know that consumers today don't really want convenience, ease of use, or any of that malarkey; they want frustration without reward! For all of those who thought Ginger would be some great boon to mankind-- well, joke's on you, folks. American Heritage personally guarantees that none of the transitions between the parts that comprise Ginger will be interesting or inspired, just emptily hyperactive. This might appeal to those interested in instrumental wankery, but that's an entirely different demographic. American Heritage have applied this design ethos to the packaging as well-- you say having eight tracks on the CD but only six listed on the case would piss you off? Well, from what the guys tell us, you'll be pissed off and you'll like it! And just as an added bonus, American Heritage threw in one of those techno songs you've been hearing so much about. And do these kids know their way around a keyboard! Listen to all of those bleeps and bloops! Just like playing Nintendo! I'm sure that after all you've heard, you're ready to lay down a few hard-earned dollars for the privilege of owning one of the first Gingers off the line, and I'll be taking orders and down-payments right after your questions. Yes, you with the mohawk and the switchblade?","Gentlemen. Oh. And ladies, too-- it's nice to see some of you finally joining our ranks. But let's ...

Godmusic,Chocolate Genius,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bec0084474cd0c07c2/1:1/w_160/1a2b509c.gif,2001-08-07 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1451-godmusic/,V2V2,"According to the Bible, God isn't fond of music that isn't about Him in some way. For centuries, Christian mortals were more than happy to indulge His sensibilities, producing only music that was for or about God, and designed entirely to win His favor. If you were a musician back in 1503, it was almost certain that you worked for the church, writing polyphonic masses and putting melodies to psalms. There was no music but God Music. But, beginning in the Renaissance, newly educated people began to tire of God this and God that. The wealthy bourgeois class and self-important royalty began to want music for the sole purpose of entertainment, and paid handsomely to have it composed. Next thing you knew, musicians were developing theories of harmony and Monteverdi was writing operas based on old folk tales. A few Steven Fosters and a couple Oscar Wildes later, we had the concept of pop entertainment for its own sake, served direct to the masses. Given the tendency toward opportunism and exploitation of the pop world, it seems that there's little room left for God Music today, and when someone tries to make some these days you get stuff like Creed, the Newsboys and DC Talk. Still, God Music seeps out of the woodwork in ways you might not expect in this modern age, be it in the devotionals sung in Baptist churches or the less obvious songs of Marc Anthony Thompson. Thompson has quite the rapport going with God, though the only altar he seems to kneel before is the porcelain one. And, man, does he kneel there often. Thompson's second album as Chocolate Genius (his fourth overall) finds him up to the old tricks that made his past efforts so engrossing-- getting drunk, feeling hung over, and going mano á mano with God, questioning, accusing, and philosophizing. Before launching into a dissonant guitar solo in ""The Eyes of the Lord,"" Thompson sings, ""There's no peace/ In the name of the Lord/ If I feel high/ He is there to remind me/ That I can't get up/ There is no joy/ In the eyes of the Lord,"" in a tired, gravel-scraped baritone over a smoky R&B; backdrop. And there are plenty more drunken epiphanies where that came from. Thompson's last effort, the phenomenal Black Music, found transcendence in his unflattering self-portraits, and his bleak confessional style is still in full effect. The only problem is that the songs aren't as good as they were the last time around. There's nothing here as stunning as ""My Mom"" or ""Hangover Nine,"" moments that made Black Music so devastating. Instead, he spreads his gutter poetry across a bed of low-key grooves, odd synths and shifting textures. Though this approach provides for some wonderful moments, it ultimately fails in allowing each song to exist in its own space as a fully developed piece. Godmusic opens with a bizarre, seemingly drunken quasi-operatic piece called ""Perfidia"" before quickly moving on to the first actual song, ""For One More Look at You."" ""For One More Look at You"" begins so subtly you might not even notice that it's started, and the whole record continues from there, with the continuous mix providing a lot of those nagging ""is this a new song?"" moments that send you reaching for the tracklist. Certain tracks do manage to stand out, though. ""Love,"" with its lilting female backing vocals and catchy hook could easily be a single, leaning heavily on modern R&B; for its inspiration. The band, rounded out with guys like Chris Wood, Abe Laboriel Jr., and Marc Ribot, is expertly subdued, allowing Thompson to build tension before letting it out in the chorus. ""Bossman Piss (In My Lemonade)"" is similarly restrained, quietly building to an effervescent chorus full of close harmonies, and then simmering back down for subsequent verses, where Thompson delivers lines like, ""A hole is just a hole/ Unless you've got a shovel and you're bored."" The instrumental title track brings things to a crashing close with wailing harmonica and martial rhythms, as all sorts of agitated guitars and synths buzz underneath. I think God might like this if He got his hands on it, regardless of whether or not it's about Him. I mean, even omnipotent beings have to rock out now and then. Elsewhere, there are nice moments, like the pretty woodwind arrangement on ""Infidel Blues,"" which stand out, but the songs largely slip by, lost in the too-subtle production. The album as a whole feels cohesive and works well as a single piece, but there's not a whole lot to draw you in and make you want to stay there. On Black Music, Thompson was able to create a world in your head through description and inflection, but here he sits you in a musical environment that doesn't suggest much in the way of imagery. If anything, music dealing with God is likely to become ever rarer in the future, and it's nice to have a guy around like Thompson who isn't afraid to vent his feelings on the subject, all while providing darkly confessional odes to imbibing and watching your life fall apart. But in the end, it's best to wait until you've tried Black Music before you head for the Godmusic.","According to the Bible, God isn't fond of music that isn't about Him in some\n\ way. For ...

Through the 90s: Singles and Unreleased,American Analog Set,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a077c0084474cd0bfba8/1:1/w_160/f57d6c49.gif,2001-08-05 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/155-through-the-90s-singles-and-unreleased/,Emperor Jones,"For me, the most impressive trick a band can pull off is to create a unique, instantly identifiable sound with the most basic of musical tools. What the American Analog Set has accomplished to date has been a neat trick of sonic alchemy; with a bare minimum of sonic gimmicks-- calmly plucked guitar, mildly buzzy keyboard, muffled drums, hushed vocals-- they concoct a warm, pure sound whose closest relative may be Yo La Tengo in their less noisy moments. Like YLT, the American Analog Set knows how to let a song slowly unfold itself without testing the patience of its listeners, moving through each measure of their music with quiet, sure-footed confidence. The band's simpler/gentler ethos is in full effect on Through the 90s, an obligatory housecleaning of b-sides, unreleased alternate versions, and live tracks that always pops up when a band switches labels. (Having spent several years on Emperor Jones, the band will be releasing their upcoming full-length on Tiger Style.) It's a testament to the American Analog Set's songwriting consistency that Through the 90s could easily pass as a proper album; however, where the band's previous releases have been exquisitely crafted so that the tracks flow effortlessly together, the primary virtue of this one is its subtle variety. Old tracks contrast just enough with newer ones so that their differences can be appreciated without the transitions between them being too jarring. Among the more interesting artifacts is ""High Fidelity vs. Guy Fidelity,"" one of the first songs the guys ever wrote; it bears a strong resemblance to Mogwai's more recent work of deliberate, clean guitars set against washes of keyboard noise. Amusingly, an ad jingle the band wrote for their collective favorite soft drink, Dr. Pepper, is also included; according to the brief, wry liner notes, the jingle was rejected, so the band developed it into the full-length ""The Wait,"" which appeared on their 1999 album, The Golden Band. There's also a chilled-out remix of ""Don't Wake Me,"" which casts the band in a favorable Darla Records-esque light, all soft-touch breakbeats and plinky electronics. The latter half of the album is a little less exciting. Alternate versions of album tracks such as ""Magnificent Seventies"" from 1997's From Our Living Room to Yours and ""It's All About Us"" from The Golden Band, aren't alternate enough to be made too distinctive from their originals. The pair of extended live tracks that close the album show the band to be a smooth live act, but there's something unsettling about hearing their music played through a filter of ambient crowd noise. The American Analog Set isn't a band to experience collectively; they make the kind of music you want to hear in your own head, and while the presence of the crowd never overwhelms the band, it's still an unwelcome intrusion into that little musical world you create for yourself. Despite the fact that it seems a little excessive for a band who's only released three albums to put out an odds-and-sods collection, Through the 90s, like every American Analog Set release to date, is a soothing, rewarding listen. It's not only a recommended purchase for longtime fans, but for newcomers as well, as its grab-bag nature captures many different nuances of the band's sound, both past and present.","For me, the most impressive trick a band can pull off is to create a unique, instantly identifiable sound with ...

Ciao!: The Best of Lush,Lush,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdadc0084474cd0c2d54/1:1/w_160/81626429.gif,2001-07-31 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4936-ciao-the-best-of-lush/,4AD,"Since I left my collegiate notions of an anarchist collective utopia with my student loan papers and the key to my dorm years ago, I'm going to have to use Lush as my main point if I ever want to argue in favor of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism. No, I'm not talking about the cynical view that this new CD is just one in a series of cash cows from a label recently under financial stress (and new ownership)-- Ciao! is a better and more faithful portrait of the band than either the Cocteau Twins' or Pixies' retrospectives that have seen release through 4AD in the past few years. I'm referring to the spirit of competition that existed, just subcutaneously, between co-frontwomen Miki Berenyi and Emma Anderson throughout the band's lifespan. Driving one another to excellence, their willingness to spar with each other within the confines of the three-minute pop song propelled Lush to critical acclaim and a respectably sized, loyal fanbase. Playing off each others' successes, failures and challenges, Anderson and Berenyi's meticulous songcraft gave Lush one of the highest signal-to-noise ratios of any early 90's rock band. Adam Smith would have been proud. Ciao! their new, career-spanning compilation has more balance than a Romanian gymnast: four songs taken from the band's swan song Lovelife, four from debut Spooky, four from the pre-Spooky EPs, and five from the band's best and most underappreciated achievement, Split. Working in reverse chronological order, the disc has a sort of ""Heart of Darkness"" device going for it. The journey leads you back in time, toward the headwaters and wellspring of the band's original dreamy, hazy sound. The farther you travel, the more tangled, overgrown and surreal your surroundings become. Starting things off, however, is a showcase of both the band's late-era poppy side, featuring the Anderson songs ""500 (Shake Baby Shake)"" and ""Single Girl,"" as well as Miki's hokey, misguided duet with Pulp's Jarvis Cocker, which lent this disc its title. One of the neat paradoxes of Lush: as they grew into their mainstream, guitar-pop sound, they also became both more jaded and more concrete in their lyrics. Compare ""I don't need your practiced lies/ Your school of charm mentality/ So save your breath for someone else/ And credit me with something more/ When it comes to men like you/ I know the score, I've heard it all before"" from ""Ladykillers"" with the buried vocals of ""Sweetness and Light"": ""Only to stay/ Only to breathe/ Only to see/ That space and light is what I really need."" Musically, Lush was always good at using contemporaries of theirs as touchstones. It would be unfair to call them influences, since the chronologies and relative importance is all muddled, but you can hear the Sundays' shared bliss in ""Sweetness and Light"" and ""Lovelife,"" and a noisier Heavenly in the keen melodies of ""Hypocrite."" Probably the sunniest of all the shoegazer bands, they skirted the fringe of that movement, more there at the insistence of the British press than shared aesthetics. Even their blurred Spooky-era stuff was joyous and exultant in tone. Pointing out the highlights of a highlight disc is ridiculous and maybe just a little too postmodern. However, I can say with certainty that I was immensely pleased to notice that tracks like the punky ""Hypocrite,"" ""When I Die,"" one of Anderson's best songs ever, an old favorite like ""For Love,"" and the early band-defining moment, ""Thoughtforms"" were all included. Best-of compilations almost always fail. If the band being complied is too great (cf. Death to the Pixies), a best-of attempt is doomed from the concept: all the albums are worth getting, so why settle for a sampler that only serves to destroy an album's carefully selected track order? If the band is mediocre or worse (cf. Modern English's Life in the Gladhouse), then the concept of ""greatest hits"" doesn't even apply-- the album is two hits and a lot of filler. Better fodder for this type of packaging is a group on the periphery; one that is excellent, but marginal in the sense that they were always on the verge of superstardom, yet never firing on all four cylinders at once. People who might have been previously wary of taking a chance on Lush can now know for certain that if they plunk down their cash, they'll be getting a well-rounded primer on a whole career. It isn't a substitute for their whole catalog, but it isn't a too-shallow-to-be-useful waste of money, either. When I sat down to listen to Ciao!, it had been at least seven years since I'd last listened to Lush, and probably five since I'd even thought of them. But by the end, I was digging out the old discs again-- not out of an obligation to research and refresh, but because I wanted to relive and remember. As well as making new fans, Ciao! does just as good of a job at winning the old ones back.

Danse Macabre,The Faint,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd21ea9e61561daa7643/1:1/w_160/60cbc220.gif,2001-07-31 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2950-danse-macabre/,Saddle Creek,"The agony, desire, that none rise above
The sweet aching torture from one that you love
For some shall believe, while many find hard
There is nothing quite like, the song of Macabre! Okay, so I ripped that off some goth chick's ""webcave,"" but short of a tragico-absurdist interpretive dance, it's the best way to sum up the feelings I have for The Faint's new album, Danse Macabre. Indie rock (with the exception of the obscure supergroup The Hattifatteners) has never expressed much of an interest in a ""ring of corpses holding hands,"" but if the kids really want to fight the culture industry through song, they should embrace this, as death does not care for social standing or wealth. Nor does dance! But let's start from the beginning: long before The Faint released Danse Macabre last Tuesday, the Bubonic plague wiped out approximately one-third of Europe's population. Fear of falling victim to the plague's wrath became a part of everyday life for the people of the time, inspiring a lot of art, poetry, music, and most importantly, woodcuts, about death. The Danse Macabre usually referred to representations of skeletons dancing or playing musical instruments. Danse Macabre is also a symphony by Camille Saint-Saens, a progressive-metal band from Birmingham, and an 18+ night on Thursdays. From what I gathered in my days studying woodcuts, the music of the Danse Macabre would cast a diabolical spell over people, drawing them towards the dance into death. And The Faint's Danse Macabre is no exception. These songs may ride on new-wave synth swells but they've got a New Order-like urgency and art-punk edge that throws off comparisons to Depeche Mode and The Human League. The album is primarily driven by keyboards, though Joel Petersen's live bass, Todd Baechle's occasional acoustic drums, and Saddle Creek cellist Gretta Cohn help the album avoid a sterile sound. Right from the start, Danse Macabre casts a gothic light on the ordinary (as opposed, of course, to the extraordinary). A song title like ""Agenda Suicide"" suggests something more in the order of Heaven's Gate than career paralegaling, but instead, the song details the wasted days of mindless work in the name of an empty American dream: ""Our work makes pretty little homes/ Agenda suicide, the drones work hard before they die/ And give up on pretty little homes."" Meanwhile, ""Let the Poison Spill from your Throat"" is gossip from the crypt. Social climbing and bitter words motivated by insecurity are made physical and grotesque: ""If there's dirt you've got on someone/ You let it loose without a thought/ You let the poison spill/ Spurt from your throat/ Hiss like steam."" Though The Faint's last album, Blank-Wave Arcade, was lyrically obsessed with sex, Danse Macabre seems to keep coming back to gothic paradoxes; the living die by agenda suicide, and mannequins are brought to life. Paralysis and involuntary movement or actions are common themes-- although paralysis is more likely to mean being trapped in daily routines than in coffins, and involuntary movements are caused by social pressure rather than Satanic possession. Still, these subjects seem well suited for synth-heavy anthems that lack subtlety in their thumping draw towards the dancefloor. So, sure, it's dancy, and unquestionably new-wave, but the Danse Macabre is anything but retro. The Faint might be using Duran Duran's keyboards, but rather than mimicking the past, they play with new-wave, goth, punk rock, and some old woodcuts to make a record entirely fresh and oddly optimistic in the way that only an album which commands you to ""Danse!/ Danse the Danse Macabre!"" can.","The agony, desire, that none rise above

Endless Summer,Fennesz,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16b9d034d5c69bf2962/1:1/w_160/f09b83b5.jpg,2001-07-31 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3035-endless-summer/,Mego,"All last week I had a Fennesz song in my head. If this doesn't strike you as an odd statement, you've probably never heard his previous full-length Plus Forty Seven Degrees 56' 37"" Minus Sixteen Degrees 51' 08"". It was a brilliant album, packed with dense, complex and immersive sound. But it was, shall we say, abrasive. And if you ever found the tracks from Plus Forty Seven Degrees running through your head for days on end, you'd probably try to silence them with drinking binges and eventually find yourself curled up in a doorway, a casualty of our crumbling mental health system. That album was noise music, my friends. But this song running through my head last week, it was pretty, and I could hum it. It opened with a bit of strummed acoustic guitar (Fennesz has always fed his guitar into his laptop, but this is the first time I'd heard him play it straight) and gurgling electronics not far from Dots and Loops-era Stereolab. The chord changes were clear and effective, and the yearning synthesizer outlined a melody that tugged at the heartstrings. There was noise to provide contrast to the warmth, enough to strike the perfect balance. The song I couldn't get out of my head was the title track from Endless Summer, an album that finds Austrian Christian Fennesz seeding his clouds of distortion with radiant chunks of melody. And the rain, she is beautiful. I'm sure you've all heard of a festival that started in San Francisco called Noise Pop. I like seeing those two words together, as their confluence gets to the heart of what I love in music. The Jesus & Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, the Flaming Lips-- at various times, all these bands lacerated melody with distortion, thereby making it so much more striking. I don't hesitate to lump this Fennesz album into that category, though he's coming at the intersection from the noisy part of town (buyer beware). If the Beach Boys represent the ideal of angelic clarity at the near end, and white noise is the sonic chaos in the distance, Fennesz currently owns the territory about 2/3 the way down the scale. ""Made in Hongkong"" opens Endless Summer with electric guitar chords in a descending progression that are swirled together as though heard through an aural kaleidoscope. In a similar vein is ""Caecilia,"" with ringing vibes set against the quavering, distorted guitar lead, altogether sounding something like a laptop version of a calliope waltz. ""Shisheido"" is even more conventional, consisting of a strummed electric guitar that's sporadically smothered in extreme high-pass filtering and a simple keyboard melody. ""A Year in a Minute"" is one of a handful of tracks that approaches the massive drones of earlier Fennesz, but it, too, captures the warmth of the theme. Fat organ pipes of distortion move in a three-chord pattern, building in intensity and changing slightly in texture, eventually giving way to jittery electronics. Also coarse is ""Got to Move On"" which hides its melody far behind a buzzing electrified fence of sound. Obviously, my choice of the Beach Boys for the earlier metaphor was deliberate. One side of his two-song seven-inch, Plays, found Fennesz kinda covering ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)."" I say ""kinda"" because I can't hear any direct reference to the original, though I do think Fennesz captured some kind of essence with his version. Fennesz gets more overt with this trickery on ""Before I Leave,"" which samples the familiar organ sound of the Beach Boys (so loved by Sean O'Hagan) and gives it the Oval treatment, creating a track of rapidly skipping tones. This appropriation says something about the feeling of this record. We all remember Endless Summer as the Beach Boys album that brought them back to prominence in the 70s and set them on the road to being an oldies act. It was the perfect title for 60s California nostalgia, and it's the perfect title for this Austrian's fractured take on some of the same signifiers. The cover of Fennesz' Endless Summer features placid beach scenes right off an Ocean Pacific t-shirt, complete with warm sunset colors. Tellingly, the pictures are obscured by video scanlines, revealing this experience as a third-generation dub of the original media-derived memories, which, of course, came from Beach Boys songs and beach movies. But the importance of California and the Endless Summer never needed to be grounded in reality; as the old saw goes, Brian Wilson's California was a state of mind. And Fennesz takes musical warmth, glowing melodies and lush arrangement and subjects them to sharp digital decay, providing another deep layer of meaning.","All last week I had a Fennesz song in my head.

Let's Go! EP,The Apples in Stereo,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ddc0084474cd0bfc94/1:1/w_160/b367878e.gif,2001-07-31 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/254-lets-go-ep/,spinART,"Open your wallet, please. How much cash have you got? None? Maybe a couple bucks? Hell, maybe you're loaded, for all I care. Let's say, though, for the purposes of this hypothetical situation, that you have $7. What would you do with this money? You could eat lunch. You could buy a cheap paperback. You could go to Radio Shack and buy a couple adapters. Or you could, amongst other possibilities generated by even the most limited of imaginations, buy a CD EP. That's right, a CD EP. This lovely invention holds the capability of true power for any indie band. It can be instrumental in building up a group's reputation. It can be short but sweet, promising true potential and building hype for a band's debut LP. It can be a way to keep the impatient fans of an already well-established group happy by dispensing the tracks they've got to spare. It can be a way to take that a step further and include about 55 minutes worth of almost entirely unreleased material, half of which is unlisted (reference: Modest Mouse, Interstate 8, Up, 1996). And the price stays at $7 as long as you call it an EP. Taking the Modest Mouse example into consideration, it's inevitable that you will occasionally find the opposite to be true. By which I mean, sometimes a band just wants to release something for the hell of it. It'll probably end up ripping their fans off, but what does that matter? It's only $7. And with the Let's Go! EP, the Apples in Stereo have done just this. A sufficient review of this lackluster release can be completed in three paragraphs, beginning after this linebreak. Hi. The Let's Go! EP contains five tracks. Only one of them is entirely new-- that is, it is not a song or a version of a song that has already been released elsewhere. It is called ""If You Want to Wear a Hat"". It confirms, once and for all, that the Apples in Stereo are now a children's band. The first two lines go like this: ""If you want to wear a hat/ You better get one that looks better than that."" Robert Schneider sings these words in the most precious of fashions, with companion Hilarie Sidney lending similarly twee backup. Imagine this against a completely soulless Jackson 5 groove and an annoying, beeping synthesized rhythm. It does not leave much room for hope. This is the kind of infantile direction that had been only hinted at by a couple of tracks from last year's The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone, and further clarified by the song ""Signal in the Sky (Let's Go!)"", the parenthetical title track to this EP. There is not one, but two versions of this selection from the recent Powerpuff Girls soundtrack album. Let me repeat that, because I feel you have not fully taken in this information: two versions of a selection from the Powerpuff Girls soundtrack. This alone carries the Apples that much farther into the toddler moshpit. The song, in tradition with the subject matter, is nauseatingly cloying. The included demo version is backed only by acoustic guitar and drum machine, but manages to have a virtually identical effect on the listener, with the exception of the noticeable lack of a borrowed ""Destination Unknown"" synth riff. There are two tracks left. One is another acoustic demo: a version of ""Stream Running Over"", originally one of the more slightly decent tracks from Moone. It's just as pleasant as the original, but not essential by any means-- and sure as hell not worth $7, especially if you already own the other, superior version. Then there's their live recording of the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"", which can be found elsewhere-- specifically, on their Live in Chicago MP3-only release through eMusic. Their version, missing everything that made the original great (not the least of which is its exquisitely arranged vocal harmonies), is utter bullshit which I have laughed at and called names. Still have that $7? Go get lunch. And bring me back a value meal.","Open your wallet, please. How much cash have you got? None? Maybe a couple bucks? Hell, maybe you're loaded ...

The Director's Cut,Fantômas,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd495e6ef95969323017/1:1/w_160/232706ab.gif,2001-07-31 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2988-the-directors-cut/,Ipecac,"IN A WORLD WHERE MIKE PATTON SLICED AND DICED MUSICAL GENRES, NO ONE WAS PREPARED FOR... THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!!! Or so might the tagline for a Mike Patton biopic run. But really, have we ever been prepared? Since Patton permanently shoved Faith No More off the deep end by taking the vocal reigns just in time for their hit-making The Real Thing album, he's refused to stay fixed in the limelight, opting instead to focus on more serious work with his pre-FNM band, the highly experimental Mr. Bungle. And, when not hanging out with John Zorn (having lighthearted chats about Japanese death-porn, presumably), he makes solo records. Mr. Bungle most recent release, 1999's California, had me wondering whether Patton was finally running out of the disturbing energy that had powered the rest of his work. While still not quite sunny, California showed a mellower, more pop-structured side of Patton, and the imperative force that usually solders together his stylistic mishmashes wasn't quite there. Enter Fantomas. Taking their name from the psychopathic anti-hero of a series of French thriller novels, the band seems tailor-made to give vent to Patton's dark side, setting Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Melvins guitarist Buzz Osborne alongside Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn. Though fitting a single style to the band is difficult, The Director's Cut, Fantomas' second full-length, takes aim at a very narrow genre: film music (particularly those creepy Theremin-tastic horror movie themes). But wait, wait. Film music? Ideally, a movie soundtrack is just background, enhancing but never overpowering what's happening on the screen. Patton couldn't provide background music for Hiroshima. But, for a second, as a lonely, reedy reproduction of one of the motifs from The Godfather slowly curls out of the speakers, it seems like Fantomas are actually going the unobtrusive route. Then, the bullets hit: the band immediately kicks into Level 12 Spaz Mode, Patton's stutters and hillbilly war-whoops punctuating a buzzsaw speed-metal attack. And just as suddenly, the Mediterranean theme returns (this time floating along on gentle percussion, strings, and an odd, mewling vocal line) only to veer off into few bars of operatic thrash. So, a few liberties have been taken. That's okay. The Director's Cut is as cinematic as its source material, without bearing much resemblance at all to the type of music normally pegged as ""cinematic"" (or the source material, really). Both obsessively detailed and brutally frenetic, Fantomas' adaptations translate moving images into disconcertingly vivid music. ""One Step Beyond,"" for instance, shifts in its skin like Lon Chaney under a full moon, moving from stock horror movie effects to resonant whistles and strings. Lombardo enters with a jackhammer snare roll, and Patton's high, keening vocals transform into coyote-caught-in-an-electric-fence howls. Metamorphosis complete, the song prowls off on it own, punctuated by ethereal orchestra hits and cartoonish throat-bending vocal effects. Lombardo, Osborne, and Dunn all provide expert accompaniment, but it's Patton's utterly unique vocals that make Fantomas distinct. On the theme from Rosemary's Baby, one of the album's best tracks, Patton juggles an uncanny little-girl lisp with a hoarse lullaby tone and a searing screech, above an unnerving mixture of string scrapes and toy percussion. The more playful, almost self-indulgently cheesy ""Spider Baby"" finds Patton handling both the growling lyrics and the sky-high spy-theme falsettos. The underlying concept, coupled with the consistently sinister tone it brings to the album, gives a weird sort of logic to Patton's stylistic leaps that he's never quite captured before. The fuzzy, chaotic interruptions in the melody of Ennio Morricone's ""Investigation of a Citizen Beyond Suspicion"" lead gradually to the song's grandiose, paranoid midsection (""Every piece of skin/ Every mouth you've fed/ Every word you've said/ Every drop you've bled""). A slow dripping sound breaks the tension and brings back the melody, just for it to be suddenly shattered again by a jabbering metal freakout. The progression is almost narrative, maybe tracing a mental breakdown, but like a good horror movie, subtler elements lurk beneath the surface. If you need any more convincing, just remember this: Fantomas could possibly be the best heavy metal-Henry Mancini cover band. Ever. The Director's Cut does Mr. Moon River twice; first on a relatively straightforward, albeit sexy and beautifully reverbed, version of ""Experiment in Terror"" that only deviates from its smoky lounge atmosphere long enough to deliver eight bars of crushing, sludgy noise; and then on the album's closer, ""Charade."" Beginning with a demented samba-beatbox from Patton, ""Charade"" vacillates between an incredibly smooth, jazzy melody and a spitfire speed-yodel stomp. As the dubbed-in crowd applauds, the melody gently returns with more hyphen-encouraging mayhem. And suddenly, it's very clear how this will all end: ""YAD DA DA DADA DA DA DADA YAD DA DADA DA DA DA DADA!"" Sing it, Mike.","IN A WORLD WHERE MIKE PATTON SLICED AND DICED MUSICAL GENRES, NO ONE WAS PREPARED FOR... THE DIRECTOR'S CUT ...

Rings Around the World,Super Furry Animals,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5cac0084474cd0c07e1/1:1/w_160/9afcada9.jpg,2001-07-23 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7598-rings-around-the-world/,Epic,"To date, the Super Furry Animals have driven a blue, techno-blaring tank to gigs before selling it to Don Henley, broken the record for saying ""fuck"" in a charting, Steely Dan-sampling pop single, constructed a Macy's Day-sized balloon of a soda-slurping raccoon, subjected themselves to alien abduction in an ILM-created music video, recorded the highest-selling Welsh-language album ever, and remixed the Beatles for a Grammy-nominated record. To say the least, they've kept audiences on their toes with their audacity and playfulness. It would seem that there's little left for SFA to accomplish, except for those ever-elusive multiplatinum worldwide sales. Rings Around the World aims for that and beyond. Not only do members of the Velvet Underground and the Beatles offhandedly appear on the record (completely inconspicuously), but Rings Around the World will be the first album ever to see debut release on DVD complete with 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound, videos for each song directed by Dogme directors, cartoonists, and underground radicals, and track-by-track remixes by the likes of Matmos, Kid 606, and Brave Captain. The project sounds ambitious and brilliant on paper, but it's nothing without the music to back it up. No fear, as SFA have pulled out their entire catalog of styles and whipped up their best album to date-- a bold claim to the upper echelon of rock. On the whole, Rings Around the World infuses 1970s soul, sunshine, and sparkle to more familiar Furries territory. Philly horns and strings seep from ""It's Not the End of the World,"" ""Presidential Suite,"" and the first single, ""Juxtaposed with U."" Like their past single, ""Northern Lights,"" ""Juxtaposed"" comes across more as a genre exercise-- this time favoring AM soul over tropicalia-- but flips the song with vocoder verses and a rollerskate-handclap chorus refrain of, ""You've got to tolerate all those people that you hate/ I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you."" Singer Gruff Rhys claims that Bobby Brown turned down an invitation to duet on the ""let's get juxtaposed"" lines, but the song remains subversively genius, nonetheless. If older singles, such as ""Demons"" off Radiator, modernized Bowie's Space Oddity, than ""Juxtaposed"" is clearly the heir to ""Young Americans"" and ""Fame."" ""Run, Christian, Run!"" gallops into late-era Byrds territory, with steel guitars and modified twang, though thematically, the lyrics run the exact opposite of Sad Sweetheart's ""The Christian Life."" Mellow acoustic strumming and thick harmonies of lines like ""you deserve to die"" give way to manic breakbeats on the breath-taking ""No Sympathy,"" perhaps the first pop song ever to fuse idyllic folk with IDM, not counting SFA's own ""Mountain People,"" which fused idyllic folk with house. Surprisingly, though Rings stands as the Super Furry Animals' boldest pop album yet, few songs reach into rocking territory. The heaviest moments pop up in the first third of the record, after the somnambulist stomp of the opener. ""Sidewalk Serfer Girl"" splices metal riffing with skittering electronics and the ever-present Huge Chorus, and the title track takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details. Rhys growls in the speaker-blowing outro to the otherwise cheery ""Receptacle for the Respectable."" The music is paisley, sun-heated, and layered, and juxtaposed to Rhys' satirical and heartfelt lyrics, the result is timeless. Just reading the song titles gives one the sense of humor and rancor that courses through the record. As mentioned before, it's impossible to deny Bowie's muse in SFA's career, despite their continued costuming in anoraks and cargo pants instead of red mullets, white scarves, spandex and suits. The chameleon act is left to the tunes. More conveniently, SFA will butt a ""Let's Dance"" up against a ""Black Country Rock"" or ""Speed of Life"" on the same album side, all while maintaining a rustic, inherently Welsh vibe. Princess Di, ""Princess of Wales,"" never set foot inside the country, and karma caught up. Heed the warning and dive in.","To date, the Super Furry Animals have driven a blue, techno-blaring tank to gigs before selling it to Don Henley ...

Burst and Bloom EP,Cursive,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c7ea9e61561daa5436/1:1/w_160/035fecc4.gif,2001-07-21 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1701-burst-and-bloom-ep/,Saddle Creek,"Back in 1999, Pitchfork reviewed an album called Emergency & I by the Dismemberment Plan. The review was positive. Alright, that's a bit of an understatement. You could have called it a rave. In fact, raves for the album were repeated in the news and features sections; several staff members even changed their names to ""Emergency"" or ""I."" For a short period the entire site closed down but for a banner page reading, ""Buy Emergency & I by the Dismemberment Plan!"" The same message was scrawled across highway off-ramps next to ""Armenia Lives!"" and ""Clapton is God!"" Even though they didn't know me back then, Pitchfork staff members would call in the middle of the night asking if I'd gotten the album yet. I hadn't. There was a hunger strike. Eventually, I got the record. I listened to it a number of times and came to appreciate the band's unique take on rock. There was always something new happening, and the elements worked together to create stirring effects song after song. My friend who likes good music got it and loved it. Couldn't stop talking about it. Yet I didn't really care for it. There was something too intellectual, too clean, too weird for its own sake. There was a song about getting an open invitation to everything and the singer going to a bunch of lame parties that depressed me. I didn't like the singer's metallic, ringing voice. So this is what the asterisk's about: As with Emergency & I, I don't really get off on what I'm hearing, but I can appreciate this five-song EP, the follow-up to the widely lauded full-length Domestica. I know others will like this, and I have to attribute some of my dislike to my own taste, as opposed to this band's quality. I was of a mind to dog this record, but they kept jarring my hardened ears to listen with strong bursts of dissonant guitarwork, and athletic hits of band cohesion, rocking me. Cursive brings to mind elements of the aforementioned Plan, Archers of Loaf, At the Drive-In, and Refused, and the songs have their share of surprising moments. They can summon some great cacophony, though to my mind, they don't swing. Yes, swing. It's necessary. It don't mean a thing. When the fireworks die down and I become used to the new elements, the underlying structures aren't all that thrilling. I think this may be ""emo,"" though I've never been able to figure out what the hell emo is. Fugazi + Whining = Emo? What kind of music worth a damn isn't about emotion? Do they just replace political rage with a general sense of negativity? Is that emotion? When Tim Kasher groans, ""4/4 hip-hop and it don't stop,"" on the opener, ""Sink to the Beat,"" I don't know what downbeat emotion he's going for, but it makes me embarrassed. The song goes on to detail the creation and marketing of this very song, which, with some nice alliteration, comes off as a well-written mistake-- another song about songwriting. Kasher warns us that, ""Some melodies are like disease/ They can inflame your miseries/ They can infect your memories."" This is the indie rock way of conveying that ""sad songs say so much."" It's not much of a message. Cursive almost redeem this song when the noise takes over, as one guitar hits like bricks while the other spears through in rapid regularity, like a sewing machine converted into a weapon. Kasher screams like the guy being assaulted by the bricks and needles, and bass player Matt Maguinn is particularly good at hard two-note hits, playing with more earthshaking presence than tone. Still, they should have ditched this number, as the rest of the disc is superior. Kasher and Ted Stevens (of Lullaby for the Working Class) weave together subtle, tiptoeing guitar lines at the start of ""The Great Decay,"" creating a sneaking, suspenseful sensation, an expectation that's realized in explosive mayhem. ""All these ghost towns share a name,"" Kasher sings convincingly in an Eric Bachmann rasp. ""Anywhere USA/ All these strangers look the same/ Day after day after day."" This is the most driving number, my favorite. An organ slithers in spookily to announce ""Tall Tales, Telltales,"" only to fade into muted, evil circus music. Soon, the band's newest addition, band member Gretta Cohn, comes in on the cello, riding over drumrolls as the guitars play hypnotic Arabian figures. The whole band comes together in a large, surging, muddy chorus. The song swells and sinks intermittently, but without really going anywhere. Kasher sure can sing and scream, but he lacks warmth and humor. ""Mothership, Mothership Do You Read Me?"" attempts interstellar communication through fast, fuzzed-out guitar riffs and long, haunting cello lines. There's a spooky little breakdown and more great screams, as well as a sci-fi theme of alienation. I don't think it has much to do with Parliament/Funkadelic, sadly. Soon, ""Fairytales Tell Tales"" (they like that wordplay!) kicks in with a fine sonic assault, the bass part looping around hugely, like a kimodo dragon performing somersaults. The drums almost skitter, locking in with the phased-out guitar to sound like an electric eggbeater jammed into a trash compactor. There's a hardcore flourish before it returns to the more plodding, typical Cursive groove. And therein lies the ultimate problem facing Burst and Bloom: in these tales of jaded seduction, Cursive captures the sadness, but none of the wit or fun of life. They rock, but they don't bring the party. Sure, it may be hard for a song to be simultaneously sad and fun, but better songwriters accomplish both.","Back in 1999, Pitchfork reviewed an album called Emergency & I by the Dismemberment Plan.

End of Amnesia,M. Ward,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9cf13d1975652139911/1:1/w_160/6413c85e.gif,2001-07-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8580-end-of-amnesia/,Future Farmer,"Amnesia always seemed to me a condition without any contemporary relevance-- like, say, consumption-- that is more characteristic of the fin-de-siecle, when Freud analyzed it and Kafka's fiction embodied it. But recently, with the century having turned again, amnesia has come roaring back into the artistic consciousness. The only difference is that (supposedly) it's been spurned by a technological boom rather than an industrial one. Or so Radiohead would have us believe. M. Ward's here to say, ""Fuck that!"" Or something like that. Whether it's an old girlfriend who broke his heart or a musical devotion to deceased folk, country and blues artists, he's not about to forget the past. The opening, titular track is a perfect example of the latter. A piano stumbles through the same three notes before bowing to a folk guitar which Ward calmly picks in a pleasant, traditional manner. It's the kind of bucolic song you'd expect from a romantic Italian movie of the fifties. ""Color of Water,"" meanwhile, opens with a cheery, nearly Southern acoustic trot before descending into a wistful, pedal steel-infused mood straight out of Neil Young's Harvest Moon. ""Well, I was all geared up and ready to go,"" Matt Ward croaks, soon harmonizing with a very Young-esque, high-pitched backup for the line, ""The color of the water was green."" The remaining lyrics overflow with imagery, as if Ward's only purpose is to prove the effectiveness of his memory. The past surfaces again, musically speaking, with ""Half Moon,"" which opens with either a sample or impressive replication of a Sarah Vaughn-like jazz tune, led by what sounds like an oboe. But a thumping kickdrum and snare combo fade in quickly, as do some quiet guitar squelches. Ward again seems to be singing solely for the sake of remembering: ""Felt a dark night/ No starlight to light the room/ And no, no/ No, no/ No, no half moon."" But he does so in such a compelling, broken way-- admittedly, aided by vertiginous vocal effects-- that listening to his non-story is by no means a tedious a experience. ""So Much Water"" is a rare, but unfortunate misstep. Both lyrically and musically, it sounds like a song by that college kid in the subway station-- the one in Diesel jeans boisterously strumming his acoustic guitar and pretending he's homeless. As earlier, ""Bad Dreams"" opens with a scratchy jazz intro, but this time restrained feedback clears the palette for a listless number in which Ward, his voice at it's crackling worst-- cough up that phlegm, dammit!-- sings, ""Oh, every night I dreaming of you/ We're weaving through a crowded room/ I asked you to be my best friend, too/ And then I lose ya."" No, he doesn't forget ever, it seems. But he rebounds soon enough with ""Silverline,"" which is largely responsible for the comparisons made between Ward and the influential, iconoclastic folk guitarist John Fahey, who died earlier this year. The blues-style track is a scorching, 12-string romp with subtle horns and deft guitarwork that's so aggressive as to make the listener imagine the ceaselessly vibrating strings being thwacked, pulled, and otherwise tweaked in a blurring manner. Although it's not nearly as irreverent and genre-bending as most of Fahey's work, it ends much too soon. ""Flaming Heart"" holds the pace, opening with carnival-esque clanging in the background. A bluesy electric guitar and hall piano ramble in, over which Ward sings with a heretofore unseen alacrity. As if sensing that the raucous mood is almost too much to bear, Ward slows it down for ""Carolina."" One of the most straightforward tracks here, it opens with easy strumming and the clearly delivered lines, ""Oh, where are you going for the two-hundred and fiftieth time?"" Through a radio transistor, he responds, ""Well, I'm waiting for a sign."" It's the neat, unexpected turn you'd expect from Mark Linkous, and Ward keeps them coming throughout the song. The comparison to Sparklehorse's lone creative force seems quite obvious, as both Linkous and Ward are country- and folk-influenced artists who scratch unavoidable, but nominally disruptive marks on the traditional blueprint. The major difference, as epitomized by ""From a Pirate Radio Sermon, 1989,"" is that Ward's effects exhibit better production. Giant Sand's Howe Gelb-- a big supporter of Ward's-- is another obvious signpost. Just listen to Ward's breathless delivery and erratic changes on ""Ella,"" which provides a piano quietude similar to that which dominated Giant Sand's most recent effort, last year's inimitable The Chore of Enchantment. The seven-minute closer, ""O'Brien/O'Brien's Nocturne,"" solidifies Ward's singular voice-- both figuratively and literally. The first half is a stripped-down folk story about how ""O'Brien blew my mind."" Alone, it would have made for a great end, but it's improved upon with the instrumental second half, which evolves from a soft electric guitar and distant rumblings into a clear mix of thick and thin guitars, an urban drumbeat, and even some well-placed handclaps. This is what makes Ward's recollections worth hearing: in sound and word, he's intent on remembering the past, but he's too modern to let it define him.","Amnesia always seemed to me a condition without any contemporary relevance-- like, say, consumption-- that is more characteristic of the ...

Out of the Loop,I Am the World Trade Center,by: Jonny Pietin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c19813d197565213bc13/1:1/w_160/a96ab09e.gif,2001-07-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4040-out-of-the-loop/,KindercoreKindercore,"Let's play ""What If."" What If... Britney Spears, who, in real life, shot like a buxom arrow from the American South to the Mickey Mouse Club to the waiting and greasily magical hands of a cadre of Swedish record producers, instead stayed home through high school, went to college in a fairly hip Southern city, discovered ""indie,"" dyed her hair a blonde so blonde it was almost white, and moved to NYC with a guy to craft bedroom dance-pop on a laptop computer? Really. What If? Well, first, the youngsters would probably come up with a suitably dorky name for their project, something relevant to their situation but sufficiently non-sequiturial. Then they'd get signed to Kindercore. Then they'd put out some 12-inches while working up material for their full-length. Then they'd release their full-length, to occasional college radio airplay, middling reviews in print and webzines, and reasonable sales. Then, if things seemed to be going well enough, they'd release another full-length in a few years. Yup. Not nearly as exciting an existence as the good people at Disney and Jive could have offered her (and her boobies would probably be a little less ginourmous), but overall, not a bad life. Turned out to be kind of a boring ""What If,"" though. This is not to say that all of I Am the World Trade Center's debut LP, Out of the Loop, sounds like ""Oops, I Did It Again""; some of it, though, does, just a little. And that's the part where the two main players seem to be getting it right. Dan Gellar and Amy Dykes have a buried knack for the driving groove; songs like ""Move On"" and ""Holland Tunnel"" want to rock your body and jack you up hardcore, but are limited by their sound and recording quality. Dan and Amy possess what could be called an ""ethic,"" or what could also be called a ""budget""; none of the beats or basslines quite hit that expensive sub-bass level, all the samples and synth washes rattle about tinnily in your speakers, and Amy's always slightly off-key vocals bear all the quiet tension of the big-city apartment-dweller singing softly into her cardioid mike so as not to bother the swarthy fella next door. All this low fidelity can work to some acts' advantage, and does to I Am the World Trade Center's, sometimes. Like on ""Analogous,"" which features the most charming white-indie band attempt at stutter-step R&B; beats this side of the Beta Band's ""To You Alone."" But even the Betas made you want to dance, or seemed to want you to dance. Whether the members of I Am the World Trade Center really want you to dance to their music is debatable. Perhaps the most telling word in the last sentence of the previous paragraph was ""charming""; it really speaks volumes about this band's stock in trade, which is to take a spice rack full of elements and qualities inherent to honest-to-god-we-want-to-move-you dance music and twee 'em up a bunch. Which is not as bad as it sounds. It can be quite, well, charming. But it can also suck fat squirrel balls. The intended single for this record seems to be ""Metro,"" considering it leads off the album in its ""Brooklyn Mix"" form, and caps it in ""Athens Mix"" fashion. Oh, and because it bites. We can't have an actually catchy single; remember, kids, the watchwords here are ""willful obscurity."" The song sounds like the opening theme to an industrial instruction film-- something where girders are lifted and coffee is drunk from thermoses, then a smiling guy in a suit appears to tell you how you, too, can increase workplace safety. Which, as a description, makes it sound more interesting and less hackneyed than it actually is. But, were it my duty to sequence this album, I'd just lop the two versions of this track off, and let Out of the Loop begin with the winning greatness of ""Me to Be."" ""Me to Be"" is the kind of song that goes perfectly on seven inches, intended, as they are, for either incessantly repeated home playings, or broadcasts on your local staticky AM college station that makes all music sound lo-fi, so that this track, jammed up against the latest high-budget Daft Punk endeavor, can come off as just plain awesome. It's the most Britney-esque moment on the album, fast-paced and questioning, featuring a squelching keyboard riff, sitars, and a flute loop that sugars it all up just right. It remains resolutely indie, though, at an extended-bridge-free-dance-breakdown 2\xBD minutes, which end all too quickly. That's what ""back"" buttons were made for, though. After ""Me to Be,"" Out of the Loop never gets quite that ass-shakingly good again, and considering that it's only the second track (or, in my more perfect version of the album, the first), that's kind of disappointing. But only a little. Overall, the whole record is pretty good, and deserves credit for its offhanded attempt at a ramshackle pop vision. Let's hope that these guys get to spend a little more money the next time around, though. Or get their hands on some greasily magical Swedes. Now that would be an interesting ""What If!""","Let's play ""What If."" What If... Britney Spears, who, in real life, shot\n\ like a buxom arrow from ...

The Essential Radio Birdman (1974-1978),Radio Birdman,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e65e6ef959693202c4/1:1/w_160/fb858f4a.gif,2001-07-17 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6652-the-essential-radio-birdman-1974-1978/,Sub Pop,"I want to go to Australia. It seems like such a cool place, full of wide-open desert expanses, people with funny accents, and all manner of crazy marsupials. They have frilled lizards, Tasmanian devils, and most of the birds are flightless. Plus, there all sorts of creepy things crawling around, like giant redback spiders, poisonous snakes, and Nick Cave. And there's always that charming Yahoo Serious fellow, a true renaissance man of the cinema. I wonder what ever happened to him. I've always wondered why such an interesting place didn't produce more great bands. You've got the Saints, the Birthday Party, the Dirty Three, and more recently, the Avalanches. But besides that what is there? Silverchair? Rolf Harris? Well, I'll tell you what else there is. There's Radio Birdman, the godfathers of Aussie rock. For the last half of the 70's, these guys totally rocked, and now Sub Pop has generously ended their two decades of silence in the states with this new compilation. Friends, they've aged a lot better than Paul Hogan. From the very first moments of the opener, ""Aloha Steve & Danno,"" it's abundantly clear that Radio Birdman were a talented bunch. Guitars duel for supremacy over stabbing organs, elastic basslines and Ayers Rock-solid drumming, as vocalist Rob Younger barks the refrain: ""Book 'em, Danno, murder one."" The song is so vital and ferocious that it's easy to forget it's written about the characters from ""Hawaii Five-O."" The lead guitar even plays the Ventures' ""Theme to 'Hawaii Five-O.'"" And unbelievably, it never sounds like novelty. It's things like their ability to shamelessly reference things (their very name is a phrase nicked from the Stooges' ""1970"") and get away with it on the strength of their sheer manic energy that made Radio Birdman great. The band's primary songwriter and guitarist, the Detroit-born American expatriate Deniz Tek, deftly brought together myriad influences into a primal stew of great rock n' roll. Naturally, the chaotic Detroit rock of the Stooges and MC5 always loomed large in the mix, but there's as much Yardbirds, Dick Dale, Bobby Fuller, Chuck Berry, Blue Oyster Cult and Link Wray in there as anything else. And thanks to the sparkling remastering job by the folks at Sub Pop, this material sounds like it was recorded yesterday in an overpriced L.A. studio. The compilation pulls together all of the band's debut album, Radios Appear (the title comes from Blue Oyster Cult's ""Dominance and Submission""), in addition to two tracks from their Burn My Eye EP, a smattering of selections from their sophomore effort Living Eyes, and three blistering live offerings from the More Fun EP. The compilers have unfortunately failed to sequencing these tracks in chronological order, but the mix is so consistent that it rarely detracts from the listening experience. And perhaps the only thing more consistent than the mix is the quality of the material. Every song is good, and it's mystifying as to why the band never had more success. Though constantly gritty and muscular, there's an innate sense of melody that guides every song directly into your memory by the second or third listen. The flypaper riffs of ""Hand of Law"" will lodge themselves in your head before you even get to the chorus, whose traditional anti-authority stance makes sense coming from a band from a former penal colony. Warwick Gilbert's rip-snorting bass chews up the low-end like there's no tomorrow. You will listen to this song in your car. And you will like it. ""Snake,"" from the 1976 Burn my Eye EP, beats the Clash to their own punch, and makes you wonder if Joe Strummer didn't cop a vocal move or two from Younger. The other song from that EP present here, ""I-94,"" evidences Tek's homesickness, with references to the interstate and American institutions like Eskimo Pies. Elsewhere, ""Love Kills"" makes a passing reference of ""singing 'We Will Fall'"" at a Stooges show. But one of the compilation's highlights easily comes with ""Man with Golden Helmet,"" originally the closing track on the Radios Appear album. Ron Keeley's ride cymbals and Gilbert's fluid bass propel Tek's leads and Chris Masuak's textured strumming in a manner that modern listeners might equate to Radiohead's ""Blow Out."" But the real shock comes when Pip Hoyle's piano takes center stage for an extended solo that trades between classical figures and Little Richard exuberance. This track exemplifies more than any other that Radio Birdman were not just a punk band, but another thing entirely, a dexterous unit whose regrettably short existence managed to produce some transcendent music. It's clear from the selections here that Living Eyes, recorded away from home in Wales, was a darker record, full of the violent imagery of ""Smith & Wesson Blues"" and the feedback meltdown of ""Alone in the Endzone."" The live tracks that close the CD, culled from a 1977 Sydney performance, capture the band in all their raging glory, full of piss and vinegar, but also raging with pop sensibility. Unfortunately, it seems as if Radio Birdman were the right band at the wrong time, and they never managed to turn their strengths into success. This compilation may finally set the record straight about one of Australia's greatest bands. They were raw and refined, political and fun all at once-- rare traits for a single band to possess. Their legacy is impressive and worthy of investigation for just about anyone who's interested in first-wave punk, or just good rock and roll in general. Now if only someone could resurrect the legacy of Young Einstein.","I want to go to Australia. It seems like such a cool place, full of wide-open desert expanses, people with ...

The Optimist LP,Turin Brakes,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82fea9e61561daa576d/1:1/w_160/2d2764bc.gif,2001-07-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8188-the-optimist-lp/,AstralwerksAstralwerks,"These guys are trying to trick me. I'll bet they're really Irish folkies singing pretty little acoustic ballads. They're so earnest! How can I truly enjoy earnest? I already know what's going to happen: I'm going to recommend them, maybe play them for friends, and then be mocked as a sucker. ""What is this Indigo Guys crap?"" they'll all say, and I'll be banished from the halls of cool forever. Sure, I never belonged to begin with, but at least I once mouthed all the right prejudices and espoused all the right decadences. And I didn't listen to folky Irish singer/songwriters. They're trying to con me, these Turin Brakes. Okay, they're English, but what's the difference? If it's on an island and it's acoustic guitars, it's either Francis Dunnery or Don Ho. Regardless, they've seduced me. Gale Paridjanian's smile beams from the back of the disc. And it's a hell of a smile. It melts my cynical heart. Ollie Knights' vocals mix Jeff Buckley moan and Marc Bolan hiss. The songs are simple, emotional, and earnest (I am such a fool!), and they're laden with Everly Brothers (or is it the Indigo Girls?) harmonies. The production captures the acoustic guitars in clean, highly polished amber with spare rhythm, letting the songs well up. Dear me, it's a pretty album, with a melancholy that's-- of course-- unaffected. It has a softness that soothes without deflating. The lyrics are often simple. The chorus of ""Underdog (Save Me)"" goes, ""Save me from myself."" Sure, it's trite, but the harmonies make the desperation fresh and beautiful. On ""State of Things,"" over a loping rhythm, they sing, ""You and me/ Used to be on fire,"" capturing the mournful feeling of dying passion. The song drowns in regret beneath Knights' Buckley-like croon. I say Buckley-like because he's not actually aping, just finding some of the same chilling notes the Mystery White Boy wrested from some cosmic place. ""The Road"" has that same effect, and in a more uptempo vein, so does ""Emergency 72."" This song follows a well-worn descending progression, but Knights leaps from note to note delightfully. His articulation also emphasizes what a nice string of consonants and vowels is the number 72. Seventy-TWO! Seventy-TWO! Seventy-TWO! What other good numbers are there out there to write songs about? How about 806? Eight hundred and SIX! That would rock. ""Future Boy"" does use the word ""yonder."" I've got you, Irish folkies! They slip away from that folk trap with images of science fiction and social decay. It includes the requisite ""junkies/monkeys"" rhyme, and the simple truth that ""Syphilis is a bitch but contracting HIV is much worse,"" which is pretty hard to argue with. The song tells the story of a time traveler who goes back to rescue himself as a baby. Nice one. ""Slack"" manages a midtempo rock, but ""Starship"" and ""By TV Lights"" drag. The latter ends with a mélange of TV sounds in the trail-off, reminiscent of Simon & Garfunkel's (who I also suspect are Irish, or from the 60's) ""Silent Night/Six O'Clock News."" This could be incriminating evidence, but of course, I also like Simon & Garfunkel, so file that away for context. After the beautifully sad harmonies of ""The Optimist"" comes a bonus track. Hey, artists, we've been on to this tactic since ""Train in Vain."" Just list the tracks, already. For the record, it's a pretty, go-nowhere instrumental. The disc also includes a video for your computer. As we were often told in the 80's, video is the future for musicians, although it's more closely linked-- since we're all digital in the digital field, such bundling is inevitable, even after the compact disc goes the way of the acetate. When will the future Me come back in time and whisk the present Me to a world where these videos are worth a damn? After a spell of listening to The Optimist LP, I shamefully boarded a plane to Ireland. There, on the green, grassy runway, were two young men playing acoustic guitars. Sure enough, it was Turin Brakes. I grabbed one-- it was Gale Paridjanian-- shook him and demanded, ""Are you trying to con me? I really like your songs, but are they going to bore the pants off of my millions of readers?"" Paridjanian answered, ""No, it's the real deal. Sure, we're secretly Irish folkies, but we threw in some drums and the songs will stay good. Enjoy yourself."" Then he smiled, and I melted.","These guys are trying to trick me.

E^2 x 10 = Tenure,Daevid Allen's University of Errors,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0509d034d5c69bf26b1/1:1/w_160/16fa9703.gif,2001-07-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/118-e2-x-10-tenure/,Innerstate,"There are some images I'll never be able to extract from my memory, no matter how hard I try. One is the terrifying illustration of a long-nosed, green-skinned corpse that graced the pages of In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories, a book my father read me in his best faux-Vincent Price voice, and led me to countless sleepless nights. Another is seventy-something Daevid Allen pulling off his skintight shorts, whipping out his cock, and playing with it-- a few inches away from my face. How did I get into such a compromising situation? It's probably not as interesting as you hoped. Basically, the Dylan Group and Marianne Nowottny were opening for the University of Errors. Tickets were cheap, the bill was pretty impressive, so I figured, what the hell. I got there a bit early, grabbed a seat up front, and waited. The Dylan Group and Marianne Nowottny were good, as expected. The real surprise of the evening came with Daevid Allen's thoroughly rocking set. Backed by a band of folks who looked like they ranged in age from 25 to 65, Allen turned out a surprisingly good set, complete with a hilarious ""prog-rock dance contest."" And then came the encore. I had heard legends of Allen revealing his penis during ""My Penis is Aging,"" and sure enough, the song begins: ""My face is aging! My ass is aging! My penis... my penis! My penis?"" And with that, Mr. Allen whipped out a pair of bifocals, placed them on his face, and then whipped out... something else. He then concluded, ""My penis is not aging!"" How nice for him. Surprisingly, I managed to come away from that show with a somewhat-varied set of memories. Some of the harder numbers Allen played, such as one which I believe was called ""Mysterio Fanatico,"" were quite excellent. I was hoping that E^2 x 10 = Tenure would be more of the same. Sadly, it isn't. This is a painfully rambling, unfocused, and generally dull record. Considering that he's one of the few guys who can be quasi-accurately credited with inventing prog, one would think Allen has by this point figured out that being ""spacy"" just isn't enough. But the kind of bland, meandering music that's found on E^2 x 10 = Tenure suggests that this isn't the case. The album begins promisingly enough-- a menacing minor chord segues into a fuzzy, goofy faux-dance beat. Spooky, ethereal guitars enter over the beat, generating a kind of bizarre tension that's never again recreated on the record. Unfortunately, the album's second track, ""If You Are Changing,"" hints at the kind of aimless, dull repetition that will mark the rest of the album. The most egregious offense comes with the 9+ minute ""Ocean Mother,"" in which Allen reads crappy beat-sounding poetry over sparse instrumentation. Sorry, gramps, but you can't pull that shit on us youngsters. We're on to you. E^2 x 10 = Tenure is not without its high points, though. ""Pinky's Party Song"" almost lives up to its title, rocking out as hard as anything else on the album. And even the album's worst tracks generally contain a few moments in which there is some semblance of a melody, a structure-- of some kind of development to push the song forward. Odds are, I'll never be able to forget Daevid Allen. As long as I live, that only-slightly-expected penis will haunt me. I was hoping that E^2 x 10 = Tenure would be a memorable enough album that when I think ""Daevid Allen,"" the immediate next thought wouldn't have to be ""old cock."" But that is not the case. Nothing on this album is at all memorable enough to stick around in my brain, let alone displace such a vivid image. So I suppose that I'll never have pleasant memories when I think of Daevid Penis. I mean Allen!","There are some images I'll never be able to extract from my memory, no matter how hard I try ...

Jagged Thoughts,American Steel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a082b1335d7bf169802e/1:1/w_160/e0f2c397.gif,2001-07-12 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/164-jagged-thoughts/,Lookout!,"For all intents and purposes, American Steel are a punk band. Don't let the black-and-white photo of an acoustic guitar on the album cover fool you; there's nothing acoustic about the guitars these guys play. American Steel do not play pure, walloping punk (few bands really do) as much as they create a grotesque amalgam of past punk-related styles. There's second-hand ska in ""Two Crooks,"" emo flourishes just about everywhere, and a tendency toward incredibly deep, guttural guitar tones culled from the hardcore scene. And the centerpiece of it all is the tortured voice of Ruauri, who apparently has no last name, as all attempts to research it bore no fruit. Ruauri's voice is really like no other, though it seems obvious that he's listened to Joe Strummer's bizarre wail a few times. You'll likely be able to locate a few distinct syllables strewn amongst his various moans and screams, and occasionally, whole words, or even whole lines will stand out. But mostly, it's just the sound of a caterwauling mammal looking for a mate, or trying to find the key that the instruments are playing in. For choruses, American Steel revert to the tried and true herding instinct, here applied as: ""If we all yell at the same time, one of us might hit the target note."" And sometimes they do, but it fails to result in a single memorable chorus. It takes a few times through to realize that they're not saying, ""Debbie works for all of us,"" in the opener, ""Shrapnel."" Luckily, they repeat the chorus five times in the song, so it gradually becomes clear that they're just whipping out bullshit like, ""Jagged thoughts are all I've heard/ Spitting shards of vitriol/ Jagged thoughts are all I've got/ Shredding my soul/ Shrapnel!"" Apparently, all those jagged thoughts have cut to tattered shreds the parts of Ruauri's brain that allow him to form recognizable words. The partially harmonized guitar solo and lethargic tempo drag the song kicking and screaming back to the 70s, and evoke the exact music that original punks rebelled against. ""New Religion Every Day"" follows, offering no melody in the verse, but plenty of group shouting in the chorus. The song initially evaded my radar more subtly than a Stealth bomber in Iraq, and when I finally forced myself to pay attention to it, I was struck only by its banality. ""Rainy Day"" is supposed to be the power ballad, I think, but it has no melody-- only that same old tuneless wailing. The completely unintelligible vocals don't help elaborate on the themes much, either. ""There's a New Life"" finally kicks in the punk energy, and it works a little better than its predecessors, as a result. It's also the shortest offering here, which scores it automatic points. It's followed by ""Lonely All the Time,"" which seems to aspire toward traditional rock and roll, employing a barnacle-encrusted chord progression and a cute little organ to remind you of how quaint the song is. ""Maria"" attempts roughly the same thing, with equally unimpressive results. Ruauri mangles some little Mick Jagger vocal moves as the band establishes the molasses tempo. The overused chords and annoying organ add to the overall impression that American Steel are attempting to morph into Bruce Springsteen, but instead of the punk Nebraska, we get the whole herd yelling, ""Maria, the moment is right!"" and a second-rate ""Born to Run."" The album's second half is better than the first, but not by much. ""Time Gone By"" is under two minutes of mediocre punk. ""Turn It Out"" overcomes its indiscernible verse with a decent, throwaway chorus, and the band sounds confident revisiting the ska-punk of their first two albums on ""Two Crooks."" Bassist John A. pulls out some impressive licks for ""Wake Up Alone,"" but they're lost in producer/engineer Kevin Army's trebly sonic soup. After the decidedly un-punk sentiment of ""I Don't Mind,"" Jagged Thoughts stumbles to a close with the crusty progressions and abortive back-up harmonies of ""Day to Night (Like a Hint)."" The chorus is actually the least memorable part, which kind of defeats the purpose of even having a chorus. The sad truth of the whole matter is that American Steel seem to make a genuine attempt to broaden their sound on Jagged Thoughts, and they completely fail. The best moments, if they exist, are the throwbacks to their earlier work-- the rough punk and the pilfered ska. All the noodly guitars and boring verses ultimately add up to something akin to a singed, one-eyed teddy bear: easy to pity, but hard to love.","For all intents and purposes, American Steel are a punk band.

Ancient Melodies of the Future,Built to Spill,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ed9d034d5c69bf2f3b/1:1/w_160/9dda8491.gif,2001-07-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1015-ancient-melodies-of-the-future/,Warner Bros.,"Upon first impression, the seemingly ostentatious title of Built to Spill's sixth and latest studio album appears to be a contradiction in terms. The paradoxical concept of something being both ancient and futuristic is the kind of idea usually left to people like Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., or Stephen Hawking, or rock bands who haven't a clue about that sort of thing and figure it sounds like a good title. Or it could be suggesting that the trio have prematurely and confidently declared a new landmark by which all future melodic guitar rock acts will ultimately be inspired. But our faithful indie-turned-major guitar hero Doug Martsch and his friends aren't pompous, and they're more clever than all that. The title Ancient Melodies of the Future signifies nothing more than the music of the present. The future's ancient melodies are being made as we speak. It's the perfect heading for Martsch's latest set of beautiful, unencumbered, unpretentious melodies. It leaves these songs to speak for themselves as they exist now, rendering comparisons, projections and superlatives practically unnecessary. Of course, there are comparisons to make, but Martsch and company have built up a large enough body of work to make the only worthwhile comparisons those pertaining to their previous work. Fully absent is the sprawling melodic scope that 1997's Perfect from Now On demonstrated for the first time and that 1999's Keep It like a Secret compressed into chewable tablets. But unlike these two previous records, Ancient Melodies of the Future rarely strays from traditional pop structures. Melodies and chord progressions are kept simple, sweet, and relatively short-- it's the closest they've come to the sound of their indie pop breakthrough, There's Nothing Wrong with Love, since that album's 1994 release. Two things keep Ancient Melodies of the Future from becoming a time trap back to the Up Records days of the mid-90's. One is Martsch and Phil Ek's production technique. From There's Nothing Wrong with Love to Perfect from Now On, Martsch and Ek suddenly transformed the Built to Spill sound from garage pop to atmospheric, almost orchestral guitar rock. That majestic, deeply textured sound has remained more or less intact since, even with their rock opera-size epics cut in half on recent outings. The second aspect of the band's current state of evolution is their steady rhythm section lineup. Since Perfect from Now On, Brett Nelson and Scott Plouf have remained irreplaceable, vital support for Martsch's six-string virtuosity. Nelson's basslines anchor each song in the traditional rock sense while still maintaining a playful spider-fingers style, sliding and jumping across the frets only when truly appropriate. Plouf, formerly of the Spinanes, is a by-the-numbers, solid drummer, more often than not opting for steady intensity and subtle flourishes in lieu of bombastic fills. One of the standout tracks from Ancient Melodies, ""In Your Mind,"" most impressively showcases the supporting players' abilities to collaborate and gel with Martsch's own rhythms and melodies. Martsch's acoustic guitar provides the heavy cadence at first, then Nelson's bass starts with the same progression and Plouf accompanies the two with a single floor-tom downbeat. As the track shifts and soars, the instrumentation flourishes with synths and guitars, both forward and reversed. Nelson and Plouf adapt masterfully, selectively adding more versatile complexities to their parts. Meanwhile, Martsch explores dark, yet vague and enigmatic lyrical themes-- obsession and mind-reading, as far as this listener can tell-- to compliment the effective, foreboding, Eastern-tinged melody: ""And no one can tell me what's right/ 'Cause nobody has my permission/ And no one can see what's in your mind."" Half of the tracks on Ancient Melodies are somewhat downtempo ballads, and the sequence is well chosen to weave these more sentimental songs amidst the presence of their equally effective rock counterparts. Placing the record's softest folk ballad, ""The Weather,"" as the closing track, may be a bit predictable, but Martsch's conviction is well executed amongst reversed steel guitars: ""As long as it's talking with you/ Talk of the weather will do."" Likewise, ""Trimmed and Burning"" features a slightly twisted love ballad theme in its melody and lyrics (""I'd agreed to always love you/ But never enough to set you free""), justified by layered, meaty Southern riffs which render such candied sentiments insignificant. Keyboards are more prominent than ever on this record, with glorious Mellotrons and other analogs embellishing Martsch's multi-tracked guitars. In fact, guest Sam Coomes adorns the gorgeously gleeful opening track, ""Strange,"" with his Quasi trademark instrument, the Rocksichord. Its tinny, antique sting kicks off ""Strange"" with a simple major-chord progression that leads into one of Martsch's best melodic turns to date. It also offers some of Martsch's most lucidly poetic lyrics yet, continuing his fascination with the oddest qualities of communication: ""This strange sound you said I said/ You're not listening, or I'm not saying it right/ This strange war of promises/ Let's call us a truce, we'll call it the truth."" Built to Spill may not have been aiming for high stakes when they called their record Ancient Melodies of the Future. In fact, the title could be looked at with a sense of resignation, with the knowledge that while the band may still have some music in store for us in the not-too-distant future, it ends eventually, and all they are will become ancient and perhaps forgotten. While this may be true, we prefer to optimistically count on the band's legacy and melodies to live on into the future, even after their songs and selves have become ancient.","Upon first impression, the seemingly ostentatious title of Built to Spill's sixth and latest studio album appears to be ...

Howler EP,Songs: Ohia,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b55e6ef95969320927/1:1/w_160/2bc6b00a.gif,2001-07-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7335-howler-ep/,AbsalomAbsalom,"Recently, the flagship of Dave Eggers' growing literary empire, McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, took the interesting step of tapping They Might Be Giants to compose music inspired by the magazine's content, a CD of which they included in each copy. The people at Absalom Recordings have taken this a step further by eliminating all that unnecessary ironic print, leaving us with a subscription-based series of EPs by independent musicians. Songs: Ohia's Howler is the first issue, as it were, to be followed every other month by the Czars, Howe Gelb, the Baptist Generals, Johnny Dowd and Calexico. The one-track, 3"" disc comes in a square cardboard gatefold sleeve the size of a beer coaster. But you probably wouldn't want to use it as such, since the cover is an eerie print of a creepy, Edvard Munch-inspired face that would probably freak you out after a couple of drinks. The music tries to do the same, but even the best horror movies lose their edge after multiple viewings. Having heard last year's haunting Ghost Tropic, this EP ceases to raise my blood pressure. ""Howler"" is likewise spare and very, er... patient, but the song lacks authenticity. It sounds as though singer/songwriter Jason Molina has kept the same songwriting technique from his last full-length, but has relocated from deep within a tribal rainforest to the back of a deserted toy store in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That line would be a reference to the cheap, one-note toy synthesizer bursts that provide the song's backbone. And the baby that giggles two-thirds of the way through the 13-minute track. The rest is the same: a distant, reverberated guitar and Will Oldham's-- I mean, Jason Molina's broken, lonesome voice. Impossible to love, and impossible to hate, ""Howler"" is interesting only for the concept behind it.","Recently, the flagship of Dave Eggers' growing literary empire, McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, took the interesting step of tapping They ...

Goodbye to the Edge City EP,Preston School of Industry,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1225e6ef95969320105/1:1/w_160/cc2dfcc5.gif,2001-07-09 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6461-goodbye-to-the-edge-city-ep/,Amazing Grease,"Stephen Malkmus. Let's get the comparisons going right off the bat. Spiral Stairs has been second banana to the guy for a career now. He added the occasional song to Pavement's albums in a suitably nasal style that blended in well-- usually a nice poppy or jammy number of good quality. Sure, you might have wondered how the guy would do on his own, but my bet is, if you're interested in this band, you've got S&M;'s solo record already and are just itching to play musical Battlebots. It's not right, though, comparing an EP to a full-length. Whatever long-played Stairs and Co. come up with may be far more masterful than this, and may shed the lesser tracks. Perhaps I should compare this to the Discretion Grove EP. Life is unfair, however, and I never got Discretion Grove, so I'm going to compare the apple and the orange, because I think it'll show some problems with this work. Verdict: Malkmus kicks Preston School of Industry square in the ass. Mr. Malkmus wanted to call his post-Pavement band the Jicks. Someone at Matador said, hey, it's got to be Stephen Malkmus. Such is the price of name recognition. Personally, I think this was a mistake. I think those that like Pavement are a smart bunch and would figure out who the Jicks were. It's a good name. ""Malkmus"" does not roll triplingly off the tongue, after all, and may have saturated all its crossover appeal. Now Spiral Stairs, there's a cool name (albeit snatched from the late 60's pop group Spiral Starecase)-- one this guy still goes by. Nonetheless, he's calling this act the Preston School of Industry, one of the worst bandnames ever-- one that doesn't just beg for obscurity, but one I confuse with that Panoply Academy Corps of Engineers, or whatever they're calling themselves these days. It's also written just in initials on the cover, which suggests, to my dorkish self, ""P'soi,"" the name of some imagined character from Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series. Now we get to the songs. ""Something Happens Always"" charges in with some pretty unimaginative two-note pop horns interlocking with sunny, whistling keyboards, and ends with some bass trills and what sounds like kids singing. Musically, though, it works. Somehow. It's bouncy. The lyrics are another matter; Stairs spins a very awkwardly portrait of a midlife crisis. When he sings, ""I've got an allegory heart,"" as the song's effective chorus, he's overlooking an essential tenet of rock lyricism: never say ""I've got an allegory heart."" Other phrases from high school comp. which are good to avoid: ""This is a metaphor""; ""The end of innocence""; ""Man's inhumanity towards his fellow man""; and ""Insert comma here."" ""How to Impress the Goddess Pt. 2"" throws some slow cello over a distorted guitar phrase similar to David Bowie's ""DJ,"" a similarity this song quickly departs from. It's another ""Ballad of a Thin Man""-- a mining man family slaughter-type yarn, and one Stairs can't fully bring to life. He needs at least one more key detail to make the story real, and ""what does that save happiness"" chorus does little to illuminate, not even bothering to throw up its hands at the absurdity and cruelty of life. To its credit, the song does have a nice guitar jam-out at the end. Also nice is ""The Spaces In Between,"" a near-instrumental that tells more of a real story in its one line of lyric than the first two songs combined. Musically, it bounces like a Chinese league-level ping-pong match, with sunny bleeps skipping over a simple, happy keyboard phrase and some arty Adrian Belew type fretwork. A blast. Stairs also wrests some real emotions from the minimal lyrics of ""Where You Gonna Go?,"" a sleepy song of loss with lazy slide guitars over a sweetly plucked, swelling jangle of acoustic guitars, underlaid with the sound of Spiral groaning. The EP's title song then rides that acoustic sound out to close the record on a sweet if unmemorable note. There's nothing embarrassing about the Preston School of Industry, except perhaps its name. The songs are pleasant enough, though we'll hope for now that Stairs will have better ones on his full-length. Still, have you heard Malkmus' record? ""The Hook?"" ""Jenny and the Ess-Dog?"" Of course you have.","Stephen Malkmus. Let's get the comparisons going right off the bat. Spiral Stairs has been second banana to the ...

Why That Doesn't Surprise Me,The Lucksmiths,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8deb335119a49eced4/1:1/w_160/b9795527.gif,2001-07-07 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4906-why-that-doesnt-surprise-me/,CloverDrive-In,"I've never met a real, live Lucksmiths fan, but I get the feeling that most of them are pretty damn obnoxious when it comes to talking about the band. The largely unheard Aussie trio has garnered a following that makes up for its small size with heaping portions of reverence. Their website, for example, includes cute little inside features, like the Top 5 Lucksmiths songs, as voted by the fans. Like Belle and Sebastian circa 1996-97 (who had a similar feature on their website), the Lucksmiths are practically personal property to their fanbase; they are the small ""cult"" band that the 15-year-old in all of us hordes and keeps for ourselves. I apologize to all Lucksmiths fans for making strides to out their greatness. The band is simply worthy of the myriad cappuccino cups of mouth foam that their rabid following has bestowed. I'll risk all-out exploitation, by deeming them worthy of even a larger fanbase, even though their sixth (proper) album, Why That Doesn't Surprise Me, isn't much of a departure for them, or music in general. Bands like Felt, Field Mice, and, most recently, Belle and Sebastian have forged, realized, and revisited the sunny terrain of twee guitar-pop that the Lucksmiths play on. The band is utterly content in presenting simple, catchy love songs that make no waves to innovate. And that's fine, because they're damn good at it. Perhaps an even more appropriate description of the Lucksmiths sound is found in the title of Surprise Me's opening track, ""Music to Hold Hands To."" One could do little more than sway to the cleanly produced, mid-tempo gem, but as drummer/vocalist Tali White explains, ""Sometimes something you can dance to/ Is the last thing that you need."" The album's most infectious track, ""Self Preservation,"" is frenetically jangly, and bolstered by stuttering, punchy drums. And it's about breaking up. During the unforgettable chorus, a celebration of horns joins in, and White only seems happier, singing, ""And whatever comes next/ If we leave the nest/ Don't settle for less than what we've got."" This optimistic take on the potentially maudlin territory of Splitsville is immediately endearing-- much more so than the similarly themed, humdrum piano ballad ""All the Recipes I've Ever Ruined."" While we've heard all this guitar-pop stuff before, it's through their lyrics that the Lucksmiths make their distinct mark. Guitarist Marty Donald, bassist Mark Monnone, and White all write songs, and they're all brimming with cleverness. Monnone evokes Billy Bragg's ability to make the mundane witty in ""Don't Bring Your Work to Bed."" In ""First Cousin,"" White's imagery is first-rate in confessions like, ""You were like a storm that I could talk to."" And Donald (who wrote the bulk of the songs here) is so cunning that his wordplay sometimes goes overboard; in ""Synchronized Sinking,"" he writes, ""Why don't you let go of your boy and see/ You've lost none of your buoyancy?"" But I'll take flagrant wordsmith pride over triteness any day. The fact that Why That Doesn't Surprise Me comes almost four years after the last Lucksmiths album makes sense: this sort of intelligence takes time to filter into meter and rhythm. Because it's so consistently and remarkably enjoyable, Why That Doesn't Surprise Me has the right to become the Lucksmiths' breakthrough, their The Boy With the Arab Strap, if you will. Drive-In Records, of course, is no Matador as far as distribution goes, and it's doubtful that the band will ever gain a following larger than the one they already have. So, the tried-and-true fans should be content in the fact that they're right, now more than ever. As for the rest of the world, just know that Why That Doesn't Surprise Me is the most entertaining Australian export since Nad's Hair Removal System. Delicious!","I've never met a real, live Lucksmiths fan, but I get the feeling that most of them are pretty ...

Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK,Múm,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40d5e6ef95969323984/1:1/w_160/e1da48a1.gif,2001-07-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5502-yesterday-was-dramatic-today-is-ok/,Thule Iceland,"Surprises are the best. Once, when I was in kindergarten, my mom pulled me out of school in the middle of the day because there was strep throat going around. I hated the doctor and I was sad. But it turned out that, even though I had no outward symptoms, I actually did have strep throat. So I got to miss several days of school, without even feeling like shit. And I got a lollipop. A few months ago, facing an ever-building amount of credit card debt, I swore off new CDs. I would live off the bare minimum of necessary funds-- a BLT sandwich for lunch, store-bought macaroni and cheese for dinner, and other various living expenses. About three days into my resolution, I received a weekly ""new releases"" e-mail from a certain oh-so-hip record store here in New York. I figured there was no harm in looking through-- there were no releases coming out that week that I was slobbering for, and I figured it would be relatively safe. Halfway through the e-mail, nothing in particular had struck me. And then I came upon a description that piqued my interest: a description of a warm, highly melodic album that featured both acoustic and electronic instruments. From Iceland! Against my better judgment, I clicked on a link to a 30-second RealAudio clip. The next morning, I woke up early, haphazardly threw on pants, and hopped on a train to said hipster haven. And there it was. Múm's Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK. I was out the door within a minute. I got home, yanked all the phones out of the wall jacks, put the CD into my stereo, lay back on my bed, and pressed the play button with my big toe. And the result was quite possibly my most pleasant surprise since Kindergarten. As the description that originally drew me into this album had pointed out, Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK relies heavily on both electronic sounds and acoustic instrumentation. While the album consists mostly of cut-up beats and synthesized melodies, harmonica, glockenspiel, and occasional whispered vocals make appearances as well, resulting in a varied and texturally rich record. While texture is plentiful, and certainly helps make Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK such an amazing album, what really seals it for me is the melody. This album is simply bursting with gorgeous ones, penetrating the dense background and making it one of the most deeply, purely emotionally affecting albums of the year. Listening to this album is an experience that defies any description aside from ""sublime and gorgeous."" One of the album's many highlights, and the track that got me into this whole thing in the first place, is ""There is a Number of Small Things,"" perhaps the most astonishingly beautiful track to be found here. Church bells, child-like vocals, and strings of achingly beautiful synthesized melodies make the track nothing short of perfect. Here, as with the rest of the album, Múm's mastery of sonic texture plays a pivotal role in making the track such a success. From the start of the album, it's not entirely clear what sounds are being synthesized and what sounds are being drawn from traditional instruments-- and from the start of the album, it doesn't matter. Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK is such an easy album to get lost in. The source of the sound makes no difference when the sound itself is so well phrased and immersive. I feel strange putting the experience of listening to Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK into words. While the album is certainly sonically complex, the sounds seem to come so naturally that any kind of attempt to explain them just wouldn't do the record justice. While the presence of such a seamlessly beautiful album is impressive, it seems nothing short of amazing that four unknown middle-class kids from Iceland managed to put it together. So I owe the credit card bastards another $20. Big deal. Surprises this good just don't come around that often.","Surprises are the best.

Blowback,Tricky,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80dea9e61561daa571f/1:1/w_160/621c1299.jpg,2001-07-02 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8155-blowback/,Hollywood,"Most horrible music can trace its horribleness back to a root concept or thought. It's not necessarily the production, musicianship, or lyrics that cause horrible music to happen; the core of the problem comes much earlier. At some point, a musician, producer or label employee thinks, ""Hey, what if...?"" And if there had only been someone there to just shout a resounding ""no,"" we'd be spared a good deal of horrible music. Hey, what if Puff Daddy reworked ""Kashmir"" for Godzilla? No. What if Mya, Pink, and Lil Kim covered ""Lady Marmalade?"" No. ""Hey, fellow members of Alien Ant Farm, what if we covered Michael Jackson?"" No. ""Johnny, it's Jello. After you finish up Benny & Joon, let's start a band with Flea."" No. ""Disney, it's Tricky. I was thinking of doing duets with Cyndi Lauper, Anthony Kiedis, and the guy from Live. Oh, and this Jamaican rapper is going to cover Nirvana."" No, No, No, please god, No. For the sake of keeping that sentence short I didn't even mention the song with John Frusciante, ""1 Da Woman,"" in which the Chili Peppers guitarist wah-wahs the theme to Linda Carter's ""Wonder Woman"" while belting ""Yooooou show me everything/ Yooooou feel me everywhere."" So just as horrible music could, at times, be preempted in its brainstorming stage, so too can record reviews hopefully deter consumers with basic description. Lately, Tricky has just been loaded with terrible ideas. On his recent Epitaph EP, the smoke-breathing, lizard-larynxed visionary sang Peter Gabriel's ""Big Time"" over tepid breakbeats. What makes it sting so much more is that Tricky truly created some of the most original music of the 1990s. He gave us a sultry chanteuse singing a brilliant tabla-punk cover of Public Enemy. ""Yoga"" and ""Headphones"" remain two of the most haunting, head-humping songs in Björk's catalogue. ""Vent"" hypnotized by merely stacking drunken drumrolls. Even the under-rated Angels with Dirty Faces took black psychedelia to new peaks. And here, it's important to note the critics' role in ruining Tricky. Angels with Dirty Faces was roundly shat upon on its release. I venture to say that this is because its heroin menace didn't gel with critical preconceptions of where trip-hop, and the I-was-just-in-The Fifth Element Tricky, should go. Here was Bristol music that sounded very boutique-unfriendly. But Tricky had left trip-hop in the dust. Never one to take criticism lightly (he beat the sweet bejesus out of a critic backstage at a concert once), Tricky then got it into his head that he should become some sort of rap-pop revolutionary. Each release since Angels has come coated in studio sheen and radio-reaching thump. Blowback, Tricky's Hollywood debut, in every sense of the word, offers crisp snippets of bass-heavy garbage bookended by some fantastic, hope-breathing songs, ""Excess"" and ""Song for Yukiko."" The first single, ""Evolution Revolution Love,"" would be tolerable if-- and this is a monumental ""if""-- Live's Ed Kowalczyk wasn't chanting, ""Let me take it to tha mic."" That nasally, quasi-spiritual tart should be issued fatwas, not allowed near microphones. Literally, anybody else-- Jeff Lynne, Jeremy Dupree, Lil Romeo, Carnie Wilson, Graham Smith, Corin Tucker-- would serve the song better. Anthony Kiedis' appearance is inherently awful, but closer attention reveals even more misguided atrocities. Tricky starts the Chili Peppered rock number barking, ""I've never seen my dad, boy,"" a sentiment that, from the mouth and mind of Tricky, seems rather genuine and revealing. Kiedis, however, supplements this in the only misguided, testes-soaked way he knows: by singing ""step into the sun"" and rapping, ""Rabble-rousers, I'm poppin' blouses/ Shake it for me, baby, let me step into your trousers/ I-I-I-I-I-I-I allow this/ Come on, baby, let me take it to your houses."" ""You Don't Wanna"" showcases the respectable pipes of Topley-Bird replacement Ambersunshower, but Tricky offers a cheap-keyboard musical bed stolen from the Eurythmics' attic. Surprisingly, Cyndi Lauper's appearance on ""Five Days"" makes for one of the better tracks, but one that Tricky would loathe to know heavily reminds this listener of Massive Attack. The numerous tracks with Jamaican dancehall bullfrog, Hawkman, rise above the celebrity help, but in this post-multi-platinum-Shaggy era, when ""It Wasn't Me"" infests from every Subway Sandwiches P.A., the edibility of said tracks remain questionable. Plus, there's that god-awful cover of Nirvana's ""Something in the Way,"" which sounds like Shaggy bellowing ""it ok ta eet fish kuss they doan have any feeeee-lun"" over something Martin Gore programmed in 1982. Carbon monoxide is better for you. At this point, Tricky seems forever lost. The best songs on Blowback simply sound like radio-marinated Maxinquaye. In a recent NME interview Tricky boasts that Blowback even betters Maxinquaye, which he now finds to be weak and Sneaker Pimp-like, an argument which could easily be leveled at half the songs here. He advertises that this is music that has been ""completely unheard of."" If only that were the case. If only Goofy had leaned into the mic on the mixing board, looked Tricky in his ganja-shuttered eyes through the studio glass, and said, ""No.""","Most horrible music can trace its horribleness back to a root concept or\n\ thought.

Danse Manatee,Animal Collective,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7365e6ef95969320f10/1:1/w_160/86d83c98.gif,2001-07-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7941-danse-manatee/,Catsup Plate,"When in doubt, use pop psychology. Now, I'm no expert on the mechanics of the human psyche, but I've managed to piece together a semblance of expertise from horoscopes, radio call-in shows, The Sopranos, and the smattering of Freud I was forced to read as an undergrad (not to mention the invaluable contribution of my own mental shortcomings-- fuck my mother, indeed!). Sure, it doesn't add up to a diploma on the wall of my office, but it gives me the authority to comment liberally on the emotional well-being of friends and co-workers. Impressive credentials? No shit. Avey Tare and Panda Bear are undergoing what real psychologists call regression-- that is, a return to a more developmentally immature level of mental functioning. The Animal collective has always evinced a juvenile sensibility, but a line needs to be drawn. There's a difference between playful, spirited getting-in-touch-with-your-inner-child juvenalia and the less wholesome pants-crapping juvenalia. And between Tare and Bear's last effort, the radically inspired Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished, and this year's Danse Manatee, our patients have moved unmistakably from the former to the latter. While Spirit freely colored outside the lines in its pursuit of beauty, Manatee is the musical equivalent of paste-eating. The addition of a third Animal, the Geologist, on keyboards seems to have eviscerated their candy-coated noise-pop rather than augmenting it. Gone are the stylized mod-pop mannerisms, the fevered rhythm guitar, the Daltrey-esque yowls, and the sweet-and-sour lyrics; in their place we find Speak N' Spell vocals, hyperactive clatter, and the single-minded pursuit of the most irritating sounds imaginable. The bleepy electronic sylvania of the opening track, ""A Manatee Dance,"" is momentarily intriguing, but soon passes into the explosive ""Penguin Penguin"" (the titles are a dead giveaway). ""Penguin"" submerges the largely tuneless vocals beneath a thick cacophony of symbol crash, bubbling noise and cricket chirping. ""Another White Singer (Little White Glove)"" possesses a kind of a sparse tribal funk, sustained by Panda's deep forest bongos, but Avey's vocals are shredded and torturous. ""Essplode"" is one of the highlights of Manatee, recalling the deftly catchy pop experimentalism of Spirit, as well as the organic drum-n-bass lines that dominated the former release. But ""Essplode"" is still shot through with the high-pitch squealing of which those Animal boys can't seem to get enough. ""Runnin' the Round Ball"" is the album's strongest track and the only one that justifies the frequent comparison to Can and Amon Düül II. It's a thumping, motorized little romp, accented by breathing synths, baby whines, and frenetic glitchcraft. Unfortunately, it's one of the album's briefest tracks, and its incredibly percussive thrust is cut short before it really comes to any fruition. There's also a certain genius in the later track, ""Throwin' the Round Ball"" (round ball fixation = bedwetting, I'm told), a kind of cut-up pastoral of tinkling organs, spliced with odd, broken-sounding vocals, thunderous rumbling, and violent shreds of noise. The throb and chant of ""Ahh, Good Country"" is also oddly compelling, reminiscent of the rustic psychedelia of Flying Saucer Attack and the ecstatic primitivism of Hochenkeit. But aside from the few bright experiments, Danse Manatee is mostly intolerable make-believe. It's like having an imaginary friend you simply can't stand. So, let's say the ideal of all progressive music is Freud's phallic phase: ""Wow, this feels good when I touch it! I'll just keep doing it."" Then, Danse Manatee might be located firmly in Freud's anal phase: ""Mommy, look what I made!"" But we must try to be reassuring. After all, Pitchfork has never been in the business of invalidating feelings. So, boys, we're not mad, just bitterly disappointed. And even the stinkiest dump provides an occasion for personal growth. Besides, Avey Tare, Panda Bear and the Geologist are always entitled to seek a second opinion. But before they do that, they should know that some kid I met at a party last week pretty much confirmed my whole diagnosis. And he was almost a psych minor.",,3.9,
Duets 2001,Robert BarryFred Anderson,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21e9d034d5c69bf2b09/1:1/w_160/1bfff2e9.gif,2001-06-30 05:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/570-duets-2001/,Thrill Jockey,"In jazz, no piano, no guitar and no bass means no chords. And as Ornette Coleman shouted at the world, no chords = freedom. Without chords to guide a tune, it can logically go just about anywhere at any given time. For the improvising soloist, this means increased possibilities. For the novice listener, it can mean serious confusion. No chords can leave you asking, ""Where are the freakin' tunes, man?"" This record of duets between tenor saxophonist Fred Anderson (who was a founding member of the pioneering avant-garde collective AACM) and drummer Robert Barry (a long-time member of Sun Ra's Arkestra) reminded me that jazz without chords requires a different kind of listening. Some chordless music focuses on texture, as with late 60's free jazz. Part of the thrill in Coltrane's Interstellar Space comes from the sheer force of sound from the man's horn. But Duets 2001 has little overblowing, no shrieks, and no cries. What Duets 2001 does have is loads of interaction between Barry and Anderson, and this is the most pleasurable thing to listen for here. These two guys get together to play at the Empty Bottle in Chicago (where this set was recorded) approximately once a year. And they're certainly not playing standards here, so it's safe to assume that they're improvising from scratch. What's needed in such a situation is empathy, and it's palpable on this set. The show begins with ""Bouncing,"" a swinging piece with a marked blues flavor that calls to mind the melody of Coltrane's ""Blue Train."" It's interesting when listening to this track to think of both instruments as equals. Switch your attention from the sax to the drums and back again, and try to picture who's driving the piece at any given time. As Anderson picks up the tempo and begins inserting notes, Barry will respond with cymbal splashes and punctuating kicks. Likewise, both sense the time to pull back and leave space. The synergy on this track is a wonder, and easy to listen for as the piece chugs along on such an appealing groove. The aptly named ""Speed Way"" gives Anderson a chance to display his considerable chops at a breakneck pace. His tone on this piece is rough and a little harsh as he navigates the difficult scales and Barry solidly anchors. Barry's intricate rimwork on ""Taps"" gives the piece a Caribbean feel, and offers evidence of his years with the Arkestra. Anderson takes on a percussive role with his horn, allowing the piece to become an exercise in pure, sensual rhythm. ""We"" is the freest piece here, with Anderson's melody following a cryptic internal logic and Barry responding with hesitant, stop/start beats that are nonetheless still tied to meter. And ""Dark Day"" closes this great set with another fine, expressive blues. For a one-off jam, this record is fantastic, and one can only hope this collaboration continues. Once a year may be fine for family reunions, but these two should really get together more often. ","In jazz, no piano, no guitar and no bass means no chords.

But if those Herbal Essences commercials have taught us anything, it's that the shampoo manufacturers of the world want nothing more than to make us happy. Is it so hard to believe that they just want to share with us the wisdom they have gained after years of shampoo production? Certainly they aren't recommending the endless, scalp bleed-inducing loops of rinse and repeat that have become the stuff of urban legend. They just want to share with you the wisdom that careful repetition can often make things decidedly more potent. I don't know what kind of shampoo Stephen Mason uses. If the snazzy picture on the back of Hot Shots II is any indication, it's probably pretty good stuff. And the ten dense, smooth tracks on Hot Shots II reveal that Stephen Mason has been paying a good deal of attention to the Zen of the shampoo bottle: rinse and repeat. While rinsing away the dirt and slop of his past may leave Mason feeling clean and fresh, it washes off one of the key elements of the Betas' trademark sound: the almost unparalleled zaniness and willingness to fuck around. The bizarre, layered samples, the sloppy playing-- all these have been cleansed from Mason's mane. The resulting album bears a closer resemblance in general mood and structure to Mason's most recent King Biscuit Time outing than to any previous Beta Band material. Which brings us to the latter half of shampoo bottle wisdom, and the half that helps makes Hot Shots II so good: repeat. Even if rinsing is robbing Mason and his cohorts of some of the beautiful weirdness displayed on previous records, Hot Shots II is a much more comfortable-sounding record than The Three EPs or the group's 1999 self-titled full-length debut. Just about every song here fits nicely into an organic, pulsing, repetitive groove. It's much more densely and diversely orchestrated than King Biscuit Time, but much more contained and deliberate than any previous Beta Band releases. This new contained and repetitive direction often yields amazing results. ""Al Sharp"", the standout from Hot Shots II, is one of the richest-sounding songs the Betas have ever produced. With xylophones, sampled strings, a groovy bassline, and some flat-out gorgeous multi-tracked vocals, there's very little not to love about the track. Especially when it contains lyrics like, ""Or [is it] because the power ranger robots in the skies have called a war/ To you, honey?"" As with the best of Hot Shots II, there's something beautiful, meditative, and contemplative about ""Al Sharp"". Plus, the song simply sounds awesome, the result being perhaps the only Beta Band song on this album that can unequivocally stand up to the best material from The Three EPs or the self-titled record. On the darker side of Hot Shots II is ""Gone"", a sparse guitar and piano-driven ballad that, were it twice as long and less linear, would sound right at home on The Three EPs. Balancing out the motionless sound of ""Gone"" is the near-epic, very much alive ""Dragons"". Another quasi-love-ballad, ""Dragons"" rides a whacked-out, reverb-drenched drumbeat and washed out synthesizers to a beautiful crescendo of multitracked vocals and samples. Splitting the difference between ""Gone"" and ""Dragons"" is ""Life"", a downcast but decidedly goofy number about unrequited love featuring string swells, synthesizers, and cowbells. ""Life"" segues perfectly into Hot Shots II's prettiest track, ""Eclipse"", an appealingly long-winded, spacy musing on books, pizza pie, and questions and answers. The song's rousing bridge, ""We all live together on a little round ball,"" recalls ""Yellow Submarine"", and the song's final line, which finally brings together its themes provides a perfect ending for an album that never takes itself too seriously. That is, ""Eclipse"" would make a great closer for an album that never takes itself too seriously. But for some ungodly reason, ""Won"", a pretty straightforward but hideously awful hip-hop track that has nothing to do with anything else on the album was slapped onto the end as a ""bonus"". For the most part, I'm not one to bitch about the inclusion of extra tracks, but the awkward, out-of-place ""Won"" really does fuck up the flow of Hot Shots II, and stifles what could have been a great closing. While it certainly doesn't live up to the adventurousness of its predecessors, Hot Shots II is a pretty damned fine album, and easily surpasses previous outings in the realm of accessibility. It also does away with the bizarre rap numbers and twelve-minute psych pastiches that put so many eager listeners off in the first place. To me, though, that thrown-together sound was one of the things that made the Beta Band's music so exciting, hinting at the possibility of wacky revolutions and violent takeovers by silly string-armed bandits. Rinsing and repeating is working well for Stephen Mason, but it would no doubt serve him well to work up a more turbulent, frothy lather next time.","There's a reason that shampoo bottles tell you to rinse and repeat.

In the Fishtank EP,Low and Dirty Three,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd845e6ef9596932308e/1:1/w_160/09aff45b.gif,2001-06-30 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4897-in-the-fishtank-ep/,Konkurrent,"Am I alone here in thinking that the phrase ""In the Fishtank"" sounds, I dunno, maybe something like a euphemism for some weird childhood punishment? The cover art to this album-- the seventh installment in a series of EPs produced by placing handpicked bands in the eponymous studio for spontaneous two-day recording sessions-- doesn't really allay the creepiness. We see a pair of deceptively cute, speckled fish (maybe gobies, or drobies, or gillies) floating on a deceptively tranquil aqua backdrop. Eerily, the fish don't seem that far removed from those flashy tropical fighting fish that rip their tankmates' fins off. It doesn't help that the label putting out these records is named ""Konkurrent"" (as in, ""the diabolical Konkurrent corporation""). It also doesn't help that the K's signify not only evil but blatant foreign-ness. It's not too much of a leap to imagine these Konkurrent folk hijacking unsuspecting bands on tour in the Netherlands and whisking them off to their Amsterdam drug-fortress to breed an indie rock master race. I'm also a bit wary because the last time they paired two bands together ""in the fishtank,"" it was the unlikely combination of Tortoise and avant-punkers the Ex, a union whose musical offspring didn't graduate much beyond ""interesting."" It's encouraging to see that the bands seem to at least make some sense together this time; both Low and Dirty Three work in broad, deliberate strokes at virtually nonexistent tempos. Also, we learn in the liner notes that Herr Doktor Konkurrent didn't arrange this match himself; Low actually invited their Aussie mates to play with them. With this, however, the question becomes not one of compatibility but of musical interest: will the pairing challenge two admittedly great bands to do anything new? From the opening seconds of the first track, ""I Hear. Goodnight,"" it's easy to see what roles the bands' members have taken; Low's Alan Sparhawk plays a measured, delicate counterpoint to Mick Turner's woozy, stumbling guitarwork, while Jim White's pointillist drums keep the song anchored to some vague sense of tempo. It's amazing how ""bandlike"" the group sounds-- Zak Sally fills in as the bassist Dirty Three never had, while Warren Ellis becomes the violinist Low fantasize about in their Mormon-style wet dreams. Mimi Parker enters with something like an apocalyptic lullaby (""I hear the windows shake/ I hear the silence break/ I hear the moon turn to blood"") that quietly breaks down into the chorus before Ellis lifts it up again with a swelling, wistful solo. Interesting, for sure, and as pretty as anything either group has done before. The next track, an inverted version of Neil Young's ""Down by the River,"" is just as solid, with a long, formless, quietly chaotic opening that gradually takes shape into Parker's icy rendition of Young's confessional lyrics. Even in this soup, Sparhawk's guitar meanderings sound both distinct from Turner's string-popping feedback swoops, and perfectly complementary. In the next song, ""Invitation Day,"" things start to get brilliant. Parker, Sparhawk, and Sally trace out a silvery, descending modal melody, which Dirty Three proceeds to prick at with plucked violin and drunken strumming. Before you know it, the bands seem to merge, and once again, lift the song up to heaven. With the addition of White's drums and a droning church organ, ""When I Called Upon Your Seed"" sounds more country than anything Low has ever done, even as it threatens to turn into a D3-esque slow-motion sea chantey. ""Cody"" seems to be a bit of a step backward, sounding like little more than a Dirty Three tune with a bassline. However, the EP's sixth and final track, ""Lordy,"" follows through on its rootsy impulses; Sparhawk actually takes up the banjo and whips up a sincere Gospel vocal fury as Parker propels the song with surprisingly intense drumming. Ellis and Turner get caught up in the rapture as well, churning out an echoed, noisy jubilance that thrashes in waves around the baptismal flame. This track alone makes what could have been a nothing more than one-off EP worth it; it's like seeing those fighting fish at the pet store suddenly starting to rip shit up together. And, like any other pleasant surprise, it's deeply frustrating to know that this is a one-time-only deal. The possibilities apparent in this collaboration deserve to be developed in ways that the format just can't provide. But it's at least as satisfying to see this one end the way it does, with a pile of torn scales slowly starting to gather on the bottom of the tank.","Am I alone here in thinking that the phrase ""In the Fishtank"" sounds, I dunno, maybe something like a euphemism ...

"Oh, Inverted World",The Shins,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d0ea9e61561daa4d77/1:1/w_160/c4658813.jpeg,2001-06-30 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7113-oh-inverted-world/,Sub Pop,"For the majority of Americans, it's a given: summer is the best season of the year. Or so you'd think, judging from the anonymous TV ad men and women who proclaim, ""Summer is here! Get your [insert iced drink here] now!""-- whereas in the winter, they regret to inform us that it's time to brace ourselves with a new Burlington coat. And TV is just an exaggerated reflection of ourselves; the hordes of convertibles making the weekend pilgrimage to the nearest beach are proof enough. Vitamin D overdoses abound. If my tone isn't suggestive enough, then I'll say it flat out: I hate the summer. It is, in my opinion, the worst season of the year. Sure, it's great for holidays, work vacations, and ogling the underdressed opposite sex, but you pay for this in sweat, which comes by the quart, even if you obey summer's central directive: be lazy. Then there's the traffic, both pedestrian and automobile, and those unavoidable, unbearable Hollywood blockbusters and TV reruns (or second-rate series). Not to mention those package music tours. But perhaps worst of all is the heightened aggression. Just last week, in the middle of the day, a reasonable-looking man in his mid-twenties decided to slam his palm across my forehead as he walked past me. Mere days later-- this time at night-- a similar-looking man (but different; there a lot of these guys in Boston) stumbled out of a bar and immediately grabbed my shirt and tore the pocket off, spattering his blood across my arms and chest in the process. There's a reason no one riots in the winter. Maybe I need to move to the home of Sub Pop, where the sun is shy even in summer, and where angst and aggression are more likely to be internalized. Then again, if Sub Pop is releasing the Shins' kind-of debut (they've been around for nine years, previously as Flake, and then Flake Music), maybe even Seattle has turned to the bright side. For some have hailed Oh, Inverted World as the next great entry in a long line of clean and carefree pop albums that strings back to the Beach Boys' early surfing days. This is what's meant by ""sunny"" music: both laid-back and upbeat, with crystalline vocals and lyrics that, while sincere, aren't particularly weighty. Thankfully, the Shins are a little more unpredictable than the summer, with its incessant, oppressive heat. ""Caring is Creepy,"" the opener, recalls the slower numbers on Sunny Day Real Estate's last prog-heavy offering, The Rising Tide. James Mercer's voice is nearly as inhuman and unclear as Jeremy Enigk's, and his dramatic delivery shifts momentum almost as often. A less fortunate similarity is the echo-heavy vocals, which likewise provide ample pretension, but they're not enough to derail this good rock song. The following track, ""One by One All Day,"" is decidedly different. The more conventional vocals are instead layered and slightly withdrawn, allowing the thumping drums and jangly guitar to share the forefront. However, for all its pleasantness, it's fairly uniform. ""Weird Days,"" the most obvious Beach Boys-inspired song here, slows the pace to a drift. Like the previous number, it's not particularly dynamic, but the vocals and tropical strumming are pretty enough. The Shins start showing their real strengths with ""Know Your Onion!"" which sounds like a 60's British garage band striving for the Kinks and just falling short. Just. The hook is surprisingly deceptive, the occasional childish background vocals are fun without being irritable, and there's even a welcome hint of their previous sound, which comes in the form of a slow, Modest Mouse-like interlude that ends with a patented Guided by Voices guitar lick. ""Girl on the Wing"" is another strong, but more straightforward pop song that rides along on ringing keyboard notes not unlike-- but less abrasive than-- GBV's ""Titus and Strident Wet Nurse (Creating Jeffrey)"" from this year's Colonel Jeffrey Pumpernickel compilation. But ""Pressed in a Book"" is undoubtedly the most straightforward, and perhaps the best song on Oh, Inverted World. The sound is like Weezer at their best-- simple, addictive chord changes and clear, sing-song vocals-- but for some background rattling and a few slow, strummy passages. At times, though, the Shins seem too content to float along. The folky ""New Slang"" is Simon and Garfunkel all the way down to the celestial humming. ""The Celibate Life,"" with its distant guitar and soft percussion, would be a carbon copy of the Magnetic Fields if it weren't for a lone harmonica. ""Your Algebra"" returns to S&G;, this time to their chantey side, adding only a spare, diligently picked acoustic guitar as accompaniment. But despite the obvious comparisons, these songs are too pretty to turn down. Like summer itself, the Shins are slightly over-hyped. All the buzz that's surrounded this release had me thinking (read: hoping) it would be the pop album of, at the very least, this summer. Oh, Inverted World comes close, but too much of the material here recalls other bands to consider it a ""great"" album. Nonetheless, I still can't believe this is what most people think summer sounds like. I only wish this wretched season sounded so good.","For the majority of Americans, it's a given: summer is the best season of the year. Or so you ...

The Ghost of Fashion,Clem Snide,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f45e6ef95969320c0b/1:1/w_160/2e166d97.gif,2001-06-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1501-the-ghost-of-fashion/,spinART,"I have this theory about how music criticism is supposed to work. Critics listen and write, readers read and consider. Over time, a regular reader of a publication finds a commonality of opinion with one or two reviewers; their notions of what's good or bad converge more often than the other hacks. Trust is formed-- they bond. It's interactive and symbiotic. We're the parasites; you're the hosts. Those of you who buy into the idea of the officially sanctioned Pitchfork opinion (or a uniform opinion of any publication) are missing the point. For the most part, editors are too busy to be worrying about homogeneity of judgment. Which is what allows me to disagree so significantly with my colleague Mr. Sandlin who reviewed Clem Snide's previous offering to the world, Your Favorite Music, last year. Did Clem Snide really go from putting out a 2.1 album to a 7.0? Of course not. Issues of the relevance of numerical ratings aside, all this demonstrates is that there's a spectrum of taste operating here. Individuals, with biases and preferences. I'd have rated Your Favorite Music higher; Michael would (I'd wager) come up shorter on The Ghost of Fashion. Somewhere in between lies the truth. Just ask Kurosawa. On their third full-length, Clem Snide gracefully boxstep between the cynicism and genuine wonder they stumbled over before. Approaching this music with a cynical ear exaggerates that aspect, and the music becomes insufferable. Come at it too naively, and you'll miss the occasional evil lines smuggled into the songs. A musical tightrope. The Ghost of Fashion is a perfect example of getting out of a listening experience what you invest in it. Clem Snide show signs that they've matured beyond aiming for nothing more ambitious than a clever pun, and that they're no longer satisfied with the predictable song construct. Instead, their new goal is to just make good music. They no longer beg to be the center of attention; they just are. Plenty of changes are apparent even on the first listen. The music sacrifices a bit of the band's old country leanings for more traditional indie pop. Eef Barzelay's muppety vocals seem less smarmy and more heartfelt. The musicianship is more accomplished, and overall, the songs sound less contrived and more spontaneous. Like the band, these songs evolve. They go somewhere. ""Don't Be Afraid of your Anger"" metamorphs from its swaying dirge intro to an Acuff/Rose ramble. ""Moment in the Sun"" ends in a ""Baba O'Riley"" frenzy after beginning with a cornfed Southern rock mid-tempo jangle. Elsewhere, ""Long Lost Twin"" provides perfect fiesta music for a warm summer evening on the patio, under the string lights. Mariachi horns contribute the appropriate touch of sadness needed to buoy lyrics that pine, ""The sea of taillights that we all must swim/ Tonight I feel like Elvis longing for his long lost twin/ Clean up the mess that Eve and Adam got us in."" But the best evidence of the band's rapid, time-lapse development is found in the hymnal ""The Curse of Great Beauty."" The song provides an unexpected goosebump moment on the disc, before blending into the chimy, organic doodling that begins the waltz ""Joan Jett of Arc."" Musically-sound but an eye-roller lyrically, the string of puns in ""Joan Jett"" triggers a series of misfires, beginning with the next track, the aimless, indulgent and poorly-constructed ""The Junky Jews."" Through the peaceful, but barely-there ""Ancient Chinese Secret Blues,"" and the brief throwaway track, ""The Ballad of Unzer Charlie,"" the last quarter of the album feels like a cheap Wal-Mart mountain bike slipping out of gear when pedaled too hard, and they lose the momentum they'd clearly worked hard to build up. However, ""No One's More Happy than You"" closes things on a positive note. The song-vignette begins with a majestic blurt of horns and Eef's best mimicry of Stipe at his drawliest. ""A beautiful Hackensack night/ Two teenagers kiss and hold tight/ The satellite swimming above/ Is sending a message of love."" You'll never convince me that Camper Van Beethoven's similar ""Life is Grand"" is secretly mocking me, and I don't accept that Barzelay's sentiment here is anything but sincere. In the end, with the flaws weighed against gems on the balances that are this reviewer's ears, The Ghost of Fashion represents only a few steps up the ladder for Barzelay and Snide, not an escalator ascent to the top. But at least they're climbing. They're definitely climbing.","I have this theory about how music criticism is supposed to work. Critics listen and write, readers read and consider ...

Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives,Prefuse 73,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a114c0084474cd0bfd1b/1:1/w_160/25565a96.gif,2001-06-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6448-vocal-studies-uprock-narratives/,Warp,"Forget subculture, hip-hop is its own nation now. And to those who say it's the new rock and roll-- at least compared to the spineless alternadultery on the radio these days-- I concur. The hip-hop artist is best posed for stardom right now, free to be the mouthpiece of a community or the avatar of a corporate brand. Proof: now rock comes to rap. Jimmy Page and Dave Navarro are Bad Boy Entertainment bitches! Like the nation from which it rises, though, hip-hop has a divisive population. Back in the 80s, artists had to stick together to defend against Tipper and the righteous crusade to save America from horny skits and prankster emcees. But the scene grew larger, and then the danger came from within: first from gangster rap's revision of the civil war, east coast to west, then from the luster of the Cristal-sipping bling-bling. Now, a new threat's come to town. Who is this disrespectful outlaw? One man and his instrumental hip-hop album. At least you'd think so, from the biters on the message boards dissing this guy before they've even listened to the album. Prefuse 73 is Atlanta's Scott Herren, also known by his other projects Delarosa and Asora and Savath + Savalas. On Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren has stirred controversy with his talent in the studio for sampling raps and turning them into the rhythmic instruments of his songs by chopping, fading and looping. Consequently, the Prefuse project got accused of disrespecting the role of the real MC. Nevermind that the results sound like record-scratching anyway, I can't believe anyone would freak after hearing how incredibly mack this shit sounds. White noise and sketchy DJ patter introduce ""Radio Attack,"" panning from channel to channel like trying to tune in your favorite underground show across the unreliable airwaves. Then the frequency locks in and the groove asserts itself, mixing anthemic keyboards with lo-fi beats that lock up and reload again, always twice as funky. It's a pocket symphony, and it's only the introduction to the album. But things really get rolling with ""Nuno,"" as female R&B; clips start to dialogue with fragments of male raps. And Herren isn't just interested in juxtaposing samples; the beats thump hard like Mary J. Blige's ""Real Love."" Herren's love supreme for hip-hop unfolds before your ears as you listen to these songs. The sublime basslines and synths call to mind DJ Shadow's Endtroducing... since the two share a devotion to simple, organic development. Don't expect the abstractions into critical theory the title suggests; this is no DJ Spooky thesis. And you won't find any Shadow-esque ambient passages, either, because the constant vocal chatter keeps the flow upbeat. Songs develop in a logical progression that still manages to surprise, like Tortoise's ""Djed,"" and as tones shift off into spectrums of chrome and brass you're reminded occasionally of Oval's treatment of those post-rockers. With vibraphones ringing and keyboards humming there's also a serious Midnight Marauders-era Tribe Called Quest tip going on. Any remaining doubts about Herren's fealty to the state of hip-hop are destroyed when you listen to the vocalists left untouched. MF Doom and Aesop Rock of the Def Jux label maintain the guard on ""Blacklist."" As a cool-jazz period piano tinkles they chide, ""'I can stop any time I want to'/ Famous last words that came back to haunt you/ All your life like permanent dry tears."" Freestyle Fellowship vet Mikah 9's flow on ""Life/Death"" sounds digitally warped at first until you realize it's just his own arpeggiated delivery. And who's that crooning Maxwell-style on ""Last Night?"" You wouldn't guess on first listen that it's indie-scenester Sam Prekop, but his light touch fits the head-nodding groove perfectly. Hesitation makes sense-- Scott Herren isn't African-American. Blacks have been central to the creation of the most unique music of the 20th century, from blues to jazz to rock and roll, and have seen Elvis-style cultural appropriation in each case. But the skipped-and-flipped vocal devices Herren makes use of also have a history, from scat to freestyle, and he's paying respect. Repeat: the hip-hop nation is not under attack. Prefuse 73 reimagines the genre in a collage of half-remembered rhymes and hazy static, letting us in on a dialogue with his soul. Through his fusion of hip-hop and soul music with electronica's current passion for the blip, he's also painted a portrait of the peculiar state of our urbanity. The bomb he's dropped will resonate outwards, hopefully even shaking up P. Diddy a little as he chills in the suburbs, per his recent video, trying like hell to keep it real.","Forget subculture, hip-hop is its own nation now.

Go Plastic,Squarepusher,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a530b1335d7bf1698b3b/1:1/w_160/00487229.gif,2001-06-26 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7447-go-plastic/,Warp,"In 1998, Squarepusher Tom Jenkinson realized that his time-tested drill-n-bass formula wasn't cutting it anymore. \xB5-Ziq and the Ninja Tune roster had caught onto the brain-twisting beauty of unclockable bpms and soft melodic tones. He knew that to leave his mark on this world, he had to do something different. Something so different it would transcend the term ""electronic"" entirely, and endow him with the megastar status he knew he rightly deserved. So he recorded Music is Rotted One Note, a brilliant fusion-powered flashback that gave nods to both electric Miles and the dawn of the digital age. After unanimous critical hallelujahs, the only challenge facing Jenkinson was how to follow such a tough act. The three EPs that followed, Budakhan Mindphone, Maximum Priest and Selection Sixteen, offered variations on the album's theme, but rarely equaled the sweet inspiration of Rotted One Note's fiery jam-sessions and dark discordance. Would he continue tracking the ghost of post-60's African spirituality or give birth to something even more abstract and outlandish? The sad fact is, either of these options would have produced better results than the one he ultimately chose: rehashing. On Go Plastic, Jenkinson picks up where his Big Loada EP left off, almost as if Music is Rotted One Note had never existed. Go Plastic exhumes the corpse of stuttering, fast-paced percussion and arbitrary programming that was bled dry and buried in a time when the Y2K bug still signified economic collapse and nuclear meltdowns. For what it's worth, Jenkinson does at least attempt to update the outdated. The problem is, he draws on all the wrong elements. Rather than resurrecting the elaborate analog melodies he once seemed to harvest off trees, he focuses on the goddamned breakbeats. Why? Aren't we past this? Electronic music has mutated so drastically over the past three years. It's currently some of the most creatively fertile soil the music world has to offer. Has he just not bothered to learn the new software? These questions are unanswerable. Only Jenkinson knows why he reverted to such an exhausted form. But speculation says he's grown comfortable. After a hard day's work, nothing comes easier than lethargy, a curse all too apparent on the album's major offenders, ""Go! Spastic"" and ""Greenways Trajectory."" The appeal of complete randomness was limited even before Autechre broke the freshness seal; now it's just irritating. Jenkinson does occasionally acknowledge Music is Rotted One Note, as on the sparse 2\xBD minutes that open ""The Exploding Psychology,"" and the foreboding, reverb-laden ""My Fucking Sound"" (the title itself is a reference to One Note's standout, ""My Sound""). But even these tracks would have been relegated to one of that record's numerous EPs and 12-inches. Only a few tracks can justify Go Plastic's existence, and not surprisingly, they're the ones that sound the least like Jenkinson's past material. ""Metteng Excuske v1.2"" is a tense collage of dark ambience, punctuated by metallic bursts and digital manipulations of plucked piano strings that swells into rumbling electronic malfunctions and derailing train noises before ending with an abrupt, glassy ping. Sadly, the track lasts just over a minute from start to finish. ""Tommib"" suffers a similar fate-- a beautiful echo of the majestic synthtones and hopeful melodies of Big Loada, sans percussion, is given a runtime of 1:19. The closing ""Plaistow Flex Out"" is Go Plastic's true triumph. It blends some of the jazzy weirdness of Rotted One Note with the eerie warehouse tension of Photek's Modus Operandi. 4-bit Pong blips reverberate under a relaxed hip-hop bass and snare. Sporadically, a keyboard riff pops up, so stretched and contorted that its original melody disappears completely, leaving only an oddly catchy series of slurred non-notes. And of course, there's ""My Red Hot Car,"" which has thankfully been slightly remixed from its single version. My feelings on this song are conflicted. On one hand, the tune is sweetly infectious; on the other, the sentiment is disturbing at best, and would be better suited for the master of electronic gross-out, Richard D. James. Regardless, you can't let this song deceive you. It stands out awkwardly, the only track of its kind, on an album of generic misfires and done-to-death jungle cliches. Even assuming I fully enjoyed ""My Red Hot Car"" (which would be a terrible overstatement), it only adds up to 12 genuinely entertaining minutes on an album that nears the 50-minute mark. There is, as always, hope that he'll again equal, or maybe even surpass the timelessness of Music is Rotted One Note, but he's not going to get there by coasting.","In 1998, Squarepusher Tom Jenkinson realized that his time-tested drill-n-bass\n\ formula wasn't cutting it anymore. \xB5-Ziq and the ...

Grinning Cat,Susumu Yokota,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab035e6ef959693216a9/1:1/w_160/deba3af7.gif,2001-06-26 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8875-grinning-cat/,LeafLeaf,"Unless I somehow learn how to read Japanese, I'm a long way from understanding the Susumu Yokota story. My introduction came via a compilation track called ""Azukiio No Kaori,"" a delicate slice of drifting ambient beauty striking enough to convince me to buy last year's Sakura. No regrets, believe me; it wound up being one of my favorite records of the year. Poking around online, I discovered that Yokota had been making music since at least 1992, and his releases numbered in the dozens. Most of his productions were house and techno variations geared toward the dancefloor, and most were only available as imports. I've since purchased a double LP of his called 1999 (found it in a cut-out bin, oddly enough), and I could tell from the cheap, garish cover it was one of his dance releases. It's fascinating to me to think that the same person responsible for Sakura also created this. The music, at first pass (and there have not been many since), seemed stiff, without personality, and silly without the attendant humor. It's obvious that 1999 is a DJ tool and not an album, as the tracks are beyond repetitive, with no real end or beginning. This utility only served to put more distance between me and the music. More than anything, Yokota's 1999 made me realize that I have a lot to learn about dance music, and my living room is probably not the best classroom. But it didn't affect the strong affinity I feel for Yokota's home listening material, a connection only strengthened upon hearing Grinning Cat. Where Sakura found Yokota exploring the sonic properties of the reverberating guitar, Grinning Cat focuses heavily on piano. The acoustic keyboard treatments vary from looped lullaby fragments, fuzzy with white noise on ""Sleepy Eye,"" to the more traditional ""Tears of a Poet,"" which seems like incidental film music from the 40's. Some of the piano parts are definitely sampled, with the loops cut in an intentionally jarring and disorienting manner. Others featuring winding melodies stretching across several bars which are surely played by Yokota. The thematic unity of the piano aside, this record finds Yokota moving in ten different directions at once. It's almost as if these pieces were composed as singles, such is the varied feel. ""Imagine"" is a minimal affair, haunting and sad, with a floral melodic pattern set against samples and looped vocals. And then ""King Dragonfly"" comes right back with flanged drum programming, tribal clapping music and buoyant piano flourishes. ""Card Nation"" could be using a sampled Chopin Nocturne as its centerpiece, but it surrounds the tight keyboard loop with deep electronic percussion and distended Popol Vuh-style choir. Grinning Cat runs the rhythmic gamut as well. ""Cherry Blossom"" chugs along on a 4/4 bass thump, dripping almost unbearably poignant shards of stained piano tone on top. ""Love Bird"" uses only handclaps and a shaker to set the tempo for the simplest melody on the record, Windham Hill as imagined by a computer. ""So Red"" takes a stab at laptop jazz, with tightly programmed snare rolls and a double bass ostinato. The beautiful thing about this many-headed beast of a record is the possibilities for future directions. Yokota has a deep well of inspiration to draw from, and is extremely comfortable with a staggering array of styles.","Unless I somehow learn how to read Japanese, I'm a long way from understanding the Susumu Yokota story.

Songs from the Hermetic Theatre,John Zorn,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab2bb1335d7bf16997ca/1:1/w_160/c5e68353.gif,2001-06-26 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8924-songs-from-the-hermetic-theatre/,Tzadik,"Feeling irremediably bourgeois? Complacent? Tired of cycling through the same three emotions day in day out until that car/plane/helicopter crash finally brings relief in hurtling flames, jagged shards of glass, and the small insurance pittance your family must subsist on until they too are struck down in a school/post office shooting? This may surprise you, but you are not alone. Dozens of Americans have found relief with Zorn, the miracle breakthrough in life amplification. Zorn is not a pill; nor is it a cult; nor is it the mild electrocution therapy that in the past has promised so much but never delivered. Zorn is a unique aural blend of computer music, Japanoise, avant-jazz, new classical, and cartoon cut-ups-- a cutting-edge synthesis of Eastern and Western traditions. Clinically tested, loaded with dangerous additives and absolutely 100% guaranteed to approximate the feeling of a condom full of methamphetamines leaking in your stomach. Zorn doesn't just help you cope with life; it helps you cram existence into your orifices, comfortably and discreetly. And Zorn is a name you can trust! The people who brought you the high decibel shattering glass of Kristalnacht; the fragile yet brutal prison rape music of Elegy; the anarchic game compositions of Cobra; the drunken, tough guy swagger of Spillane; the searing Semitic lament of Bar Kokhba; and the dark torture fetish erotica of Naked City now bring you Songs from the Hermetic Theatre, the newest installment of genital-bludgeoning life improvement strategies. It's simple. Hermetic Theatre is the no-hassle, easy-to-follow, four-step program for achieving that tenuous, bi-polar, paranoid, quasi-hallucinatory handle on living. Let's walk through it! 1. ""American Magus"" (14:03). A tribute to the legendary American ethnomusicologist Harry Smith, ""American Magus"" is Zorn's first foray to electronic composition. Drawing on the sharp, pins-and-needles electronics of Fennesz and Pita, and the reckless noise collage of Merzbow, ""Magus"" layers incessant cascades of whistling sound over washes of sheer static. There is no silence to be found in this piece, just endlessly mutating frequencies tripping over one another in fast-forward. Careening glitches serve as the piece's only semblance of percussion, tracing the disturbingly lovely melodies like the shadow beneath a butterfly. 2. ""In the Very Eye of Night"" (11:16). The second composition opens with the voice of filmmaker Maya Deren, to whom the piece is dedicated, discussing time, film and femininity. Electric bass and bass drum drone darkly beneath soft aquatic sounds. High-pitched glass bowl and wooden flute squeal in the far corners, rising while the percussion approaches like thunder. Organic where its predecessor was gleefully synthetic, the watery ""Night"" is no less intense: rumbling in the bowels and the stomach, approximating birth. 3. ""The Nerve Key"" (9:29). Unbearably jittery, ""The Nerve Key"" is Zorn's first composition of computer music. Where Mille Plateaux's provocative Clicks & Cuts 2 highlighted the warmth and ambience of glitch music, ""Nerve"" recasts the genre as alien and alarming. ""The Nerve Key"" is computer neurosis, spastic and anxious. The sound of the machine on the edge of a nervous breakdown. If played at high volumes, it could very well damage you, your stereo and everyone you hold dear. 4. ""Beuysblock"" (16:13). ""Beuysblock"" is a junk symphony, featuring Jennifer Choi on violins and Zorn on some sixty different ""instruments,"" such as wax paper, moustache scissors, Polaroid camera, blood, rubber stamps, $82 in cash, staple gun, hair, vacuum tubes, newspapers and dirt. Choi's gorgeous, spare violin lines open the piece, layered one on top of the next. The various items (virtually unrecognizable) combine in various incarnations of household noise. A piano adds plaintive lines beneath the junk orchestra as if to add a massive question mark to the proceedings. Alternately fascinating and vile, the haphazard scraping, swishing, clanging, sawing, blow-drying, collapsing, humming, bubbling and bleeding attain the center, while the traditional instrumentation is reduced to background noise. ""Beuysblock"" is a world turned upside-down, music turned on its head and forced to yield to the clamor of everyday life. See how easy it can be! A new life for the price of a song. And after Hermetic Theatre, you will receive more Zorn: a new dose approximately every 55 minutes. How can you possibly resist? Zorn: Songs from the Hermetic Theatre. The antidote to dying miserably. WARNING: Zorn may be habit-forming. Zorn is illegal in NJ. Zorn users may be pretentious assholes that hang out in converted kosher wineries, smoking overpriced cigarettes and gabbing about Kabbalah, Marguerite Duras novels, and foreign films.

The Walkmen,The Walkmen,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9c4b1335d7bf1699546/1:1/w_160/175f8808.gif,2001-06-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8570-the-walkmen/,StarTime,"Walter Martin, Matt Barrick, Paul Maroon-- respectively the organist, drummer, and guitarist for the late Jonathan Fire*Eater-- used their Dreamworks cash to purchase a Harlem loft, install a recording studio, and start over. Wolf Songs for Lambs flopped financially, primarily because it sounded recorded in a large, wet box. However, it was a pretty damn unique and haunting garage pop album, and even predated some modern NYC trends (like the Strokes, the French Kicks, the Mooney Suzuki). Now residing on the more modest, yet bombastically monikered StarTime International, home too of the French Kicks, the Walkmen emerge from their uptown cocoon with a promising, and similarly unique self-titled EP. The immediate difference between Jonathan FireEater and the Walkmen is the change in singers. Stuart Lupton, who now concentrates his efforts on a new band called the Child Ballads, obviously worshipped Mick Jagger's slur and rasp. His poetic rants fit FireEater perfectly. The Walkmen stand behind new pipes, Hamilton Leithauser, who recalls a more operatic Lupton, and, frighteningly, at times, Jon Bon Jovi. ""Wake Up"" struts along on heavy, robotic drumming and stabs of reverb guitar. Martin replaces the fuzzy drone of Fire*Eater's organ with ambient twinkles and piano hammers that would make RZA smile, if RZA does, in fact, smile. The track recalls a ""live,"" sample-less Eternals, and, like the Eternals, your enjoyment hangs heavily on your ability to stomach the vocals. But it's amazing how fresh a set of drums, a bass, a guitar, and a keyboard can sound with some simple re-thinking, re-arrangement, and production touches. The Bon Joviest singing runs throughout ""We've Been Had."" But Bon Jovi never belted showtune-influenced rapture over echoing, sugar-tripped minimalism. If the Dismemberment Plan lived in 1967, they might come up with something like ""The Crimps,"" which skitters and pops on drum rolls and sleighbells, echoing bumblebee guitar, and spooky keys. Distant harmonies and rug-smothered drums slowly emanate under ""Summer Stage."" In the end, Martin, Barrick, and Maroon cook up another subtle, spacious sound that chills out like a phantom. In many ways, the Walkmen perfectly embody a Harlem loft-- high ceilings, echoing acoustics, raw, exposed walls, and some arty beatnik who's probably from suburban New Jersey squatting right in the middle.","Walter Martin, Matt Barrick, Paul Maroon-- respectively the organist, drummer, and guitarist for the late Jonathan Fire*Eater-- used their ...

The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads,Lift to Experience,by: Brent S.

The NRA is setting up shop in the White House; the federal government is subsidizing faith-based social services with taxpayer money; the bumper sticker injunction 'Don't Mess with Texas' has finally assumed the force of law. Guns, God and Texas. It was only a matter of time before the age acquired its opus. But who would have predicted a ten-gallon prog-emo Biblical concept album about the Texan apocalypse? Did I stutter? ""When the Winston Churchills start firing their Winston rifles into the sky from the Lone Star State, drinking the Lone Star Beer and smoking their Winston cigarettes, you know the time is growing nigh..."" So rambles the deadpan Josh Pearson on ""Just as Was Told,"" the opening track of The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads. The three Denton, Texas boys-- Pearson, Josh Browning and Andy Young-- learn from a drawling Angel of the Lord that ""the USA is the center of Jerusalem,"" before the track erupts into a maelstrom of guitars like a tornado tearing into a trailer park. Spoken-word introspection and cherubic incantations weave together with twisted razor-wire space-rock. The elements are not strikingly original: one can hear traces of the journalistic intonations of Brian McMahan circa Slint's ""Breadcrumb Trail""; the signature screwdriver-on-frets guitar liturgy of GYBE's Efrim Menuck; the late Jeff Buckley's ascendant vocals. But the intensity of music and vision is enough to overcome Lift to Experience's derivations. They are present, but for a moment, they are consecrated. ""Down Came the Angels"" possesses a lighter touch, spun simply on the deep intermittent reverb of a lone guitar. But the song sets in relief a weakness that haunts the album: a total lack of phrasing. Seems like a trivial complaint on paper, but the truth is that Pearson sings until he feels like speaking, sings a little more, then resorts again to spoken word to serve the exigencies of the Good News. It's a hymn devolving into a prayer, and then into a sermon. And like church, it grows wearisome. But all is temporarily forgiven with the thunderous intrusion of ""Waiting to Hit."" Reminiscent of early Spiritualized, the track lilts melodically and accelerates in dusty squalls of noise. In ""Waiting,"" the Lord commands the band to inform the world about ""the glory of the Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads."" And Person replies, ""Lord, I'll make you a deal: I will if you give me a smash hit so I can build a city on the hill."" Go forth and spread the word, I guess. After all, the next song, ""The Ground So Soft,"" opens with the boys singing a cappella from 1 Corinthians 15:55, straight out of the King James: ""Death where is thy sting? Grave where is thy victory?"" The effect is strikingly bizarre, like the first time you heard ""I love you Jesus Christ!"" on Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea: some pure confessional momentarily rising above the din. The first single, ""These Are the Days,"" is easily the strongest track on The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads: somehow catchy, bluesy and full of wrath. It's constructed around jangly loops of guitar, and for the first time, Pearson's loose and hyperbolic lyricism functions as an asset instead of a liability. So, as to preempt any comparisons to Europe's ""The Final Countdown"" (even though Pearson does, at one point, actually start counting down to apocalypse), the band takes a jab at ""all you haircut bands doing headstands thinking you'll turn the world upside down."" Why, you ask? ""Because we're simply the best band in the whole damn land... and Texas is the reason."" In the end (of the album, not the world), the parade of self-references, such as the above and, ""Just a stupid ranch hand in a Texas rock band trying to understand God's master plan"" grows cumbersome. And unfortunately, ""angels with crippled wings"" and ""God's terrible swift sword"" do not lighten the load. The music is supple, and often absolutely inspiring; however, the lyrics, frequent spoken-word passages, and hymns are often deadening. Lift to Experience simply sprawl like prairies, and maybe like Texas: there's simply too much of it. There's no question that The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads is built solid. But the second coming? Not quite yet.","Welcome to the Bush era! The NRA is setting up shop in the White House; the federal government is subsidizing ...

Chicago Underground Quartet,Chicago Underground Quartet,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b2c0084474cd0c07aa/1:1/w_160/96498436.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:06,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1440-chicago-underground-quartet/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"My brother turned me on to jazz in the mid-80's. At that time, many classic records were out of print and just starting to be issued on CD. Columbia had the most distinguished catalog, with Miles Davis, the Armstrong Hot Fives and Sevens, all the early Billie Holiday, some Duke, the most popular Monk, and Dave Brubeck, to name just a few. One by one, Columbia reissued the old records on CD as part of the ""Columbia Jazz Masterpieces"" series, complete with new artwork, digital remastering and, in some cases (like Miles Ahead), radical remixing. I remember reading the promo material in the CD booklets and getting excited about what was going to be reissued next. Another Columbia artist was Wynton Marsalis. When I first began listening to jazz, Wynton was creating high-profile records of his own. At that time, his quintet included his brother Branford and was heavily indebted to the Wayne Shorter/Herbie Hancock lineup of Miles Davis' quintet. I liked some of those mid-80's Marsalis records. Black Codes from the Underground, in particular, still stands as a powerful statement. While he was making this music, Wynton was just hitting his stride as a tastemaker. Along with critic pal Stanley Crouch, he was telling the world that this music was the greatest form since the demise of symphonic music, but that only a narrow slice of what was being marketed as ""jazz"" actually deserved the appellation. To him, the biggest imposter was electrified fusion. Now, I admit I was an impressionable teen. Wynton, Crouch and my brother all told me ""fusion sucks,"" and I never thought to question their judgment. Any jazz with electric instruments, with the possible exception of In a Silent Way, was to be avoided at all costs. That was the Chuck Mangione shit. Fuck that. Forgive me, Miles, for I knew not what I did. It took me another ten years to figure out that there was some great electrified jazz floating around. And now I find music that blends jazz with textures from other music more interesting than the ""real thing."" Like the last Isotope 217 album. Or this new one by the Chicago Underground Quartet. Like Isotope, the Chicago Underground in its various numerical configurations is an adventurous fusion unit fronted by cornet player Rob Mazurek. The other constant is drummer/vibraphonist Chad Taylor. This edition also includes the guitar of Jeff Parker (of Isotope and Tortoise), in addition to the old standby Noel Kupersmith (now also a member of Brokeback) on bass. With so many musicians on loan from such familiar bands, the Chicago Underground Quartet is bound to sound a bit, well, familiar. And it does. This is definitely the kind of tech-tweaked instrumental music that Chicago has been specializing in for close to a decade. But the tweaks are subtle, and this is such a low key, unassuming and melodic record that it still sounds very fresh to my ears. Jeff Parker opens the album on ""Tunnel Chrome"" with a deftly plucked guitar pattern that recalls the opening chords to ""Night in Tunisia."" Taylor doubles up on both drums and vibes, and Mazurek adds some heavily processed horn (he's also credited on the album sleeve with ""electronics"") that has a very guitar-like tonality. His processing gives the piece, which is very straightforward post-bop jazz, a bit of an otherworldly flavor. In addition to Parker's lovely guitar playing throughout, these less traditional flourishes are what make this record interesting. ""Three in the Morning"" begins with a gorgeous guitar lead that soon dissolves into delicate phase-shifts and backward harmonies as Mazurek's cornet states the theme. ""Four in the Morning"" sounds all the world like a ballad off of Miles Davis Cookin', with Mazurek on Harmon mute. But Taylor's brushwork is so robotic it sounds like a Pro-Tools loop (which I suppose it might actually be). There's no thought of adding an offbeat accent to this brief song, which gives a whiff of the technology involved in the recording. This restrained approach is the order of the day for the Chicago Underground Quartet, and only occasionally do they cut loose and blow. On the flowing, impressionistic ""Welcome"" (not the Coltrane tune), Parker adds some distortion to his guitar and Mazurek goes into gospelized Donald Ayler mode, sounding like he's gearing up for a march. It's a welcome change of pace, but the mood here tends toward the controlled, thoughtful and expressive. While this is nothing like the full-blown electronic love-in that was the last Isotope record, the Chicago Underground Quartet know how to integrate technology into their distinctive jazz sound. It's a fusion of some kind-- I'm sure of that-- so Wynton would not approve. But I'd call it a worthy extension of the tradition.","My brother turned me on to jazz in the mid-80's.

Everybody Wants to Know,Swell,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6039d034d5c69bf342e/1:1/w_160/b0312958.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7662-everybody-wants-to-know/,Beggars Banquet,"Once upon a time in the land of San Francisco (1989, to be exact), there was a band called Swell. Those were heady times, they were. Grunge was still underground, and the Pixies were making a racket all the way across America from Boston. Swell managed to hear some Pixies records, and it forever changed the way they played music. At least, that's what I'm assuming, since that's the backstory for basically every post-Pixies alternative rock band. During the course of their career, Swell has been through some rough times (not the least of which was when one of their songs was given inclusion on the Showgirls soundtrack). Their lineup seen several members come and go, many only sticking around for one album. And on Everybody Wants to Know, it's debatable whether Swell is actually even a band anymore. See, they're down to just one guy, longtime frontman David Freel, who plays all the instruments on the album, except for some drums that were laid down by ex-Daddy Longhead (who?) percussionist Rey Washam. Freel has a subdued vocal style that he likes to self-harmonize with, giving the music a fuller sound. For example, in the opening moments of ""East n' West,"" a couple of David Freels get together and sing, ""Crash down the steps like they're magic/ Fuck the pain, 'cause pain's never lasted/ Everything about you was spastic/ Got to pee, and we're stuck in traffic/ Life is short for something so graphic/ And we began to finally grasp it."" Not too shabby, eh? Yes? Hey, I never said it was fucking Longfellow, but it's a favorite moment of mine here. Thankfully, Freel writes some rather engaging music to back up his lyrics, though sometimes he plays it for way too long, like on ""...A Velvet Sun,"" where the outro lasts pretty much indefinitely. That's followed by ""Like Poverty,"" whose verse noise makes it a bit like being followed around by a staticky radio station. But it gets a little clearer in patches, and the acoustic guitar over the top sounds nice enough. Virtually every track on the record fall in a range of about 20-30 bpms, never straying far from that mid-tempo zone where it's impossible to rock, but also hard to get too sappy. The album gains most of its variety, then, from tweaking the sonics and varying the instrumentation. There's that aforementioned acoustic guitar, ambient keyboards, and little analog synth countermelodies on the instrumental ""I Don't Think So,"" while ""East n' West"" lays down the distorted guitars and funks the drumming up a bit. A few tracks suffer from some piano overkill, which could have been fixed by simply repositioning a couple of faders on the mixing board. So, when it all boils down to the whole experience of listening to Swell, how does this latest effort fare? Is it, in fact, swell? Well, it's kind of swell for the most part. The production can be kind of neat, and those analogue synths that pop up now and then hit my nerd zone right where it counts. It's hardly the equal of past efforts like Swell's 1997 high-water mark Too Many Days without Thinking, but it's still an improvement over their last album as a full band, For All the Beautiful People. Everybody Wants to Know is the kind of album that grows more rewarding the second and third times through, as the subtle hooks gradually sink in. But once those hooks have engrained themselves in those old skullbag, it's pretty unlikely they'll offer anything you can't get from any other anonymous alterna-rock record. For all its nifty accoutrements and production ideas, Everybody Wants to Know is ultimately just a halfway decent affair that would be better if it were shorter. My recommendation to David Freel is to get the band back. They may be hard to work with or whatever, but it would at least lend a spirit of interaction that's sorely missing here.","Once upon a time in the land of San Francisco (1989, to be exact), there was a band called Swell ...

Hotel Lives,Simon Joyner,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba30c0084474cd0c27b6/1:1/w_160/d37b2a6f.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4306-hotel-lives/,AtavisticTruckstopAtavisticTruckstop,"The wallpaper is rippled from its age, sagging and pregnant with the water leaking in from above. The window panes are mildewed and cobwebbed, and a dozen insect corpses lie scattered on the sill. They are the victims of the naked bulb that hangs from the ceiling, casting a dull glow on the bed, which vibrates if you put enough quarters in the slot on the headboard. The scent of alcohol snakes through the room like a vine strangling a trellis. The bed's stained sheets cover a mattress that would just as soon swallow you as comfort you to sleep. This is Simon Joyner's hotel suite. It's not so much a place to live as a place to retreat to, a tattered sanctuary from the withering attacks of the heart on the cortex, and a place to retrieve your body from the floor where it fell in last night's drunken stupor in private. Joyner has lived here for a long time, first emerging from his tired bedsit in 1993 with the Room Temperature album, and following it up with a series of ramshackle folk records that have quietly established him as a lyricist with few equals. Hotel Lives finds Joyner opening up his box of demons and putting them to rest, one by one. His lyrics are those rare ones that could just as easily read as a book of spectacular poetry, but they're truly brought to life on the album by an impressive cast of collaborators. Not the least of these is producer Michael Krassner, who captures every expression of misery, pain, and redemption with a remarkably adept hand. Virtually every member of the legendary Boxhead Ensemble's new line-up is here; pianist Will Hendricks, drummer Glenn Kotche, and a host of other instrumentalists color cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm's sparse arrangements with painterly strokes. Though the music on Hotel Lives more often resembles the brooding intensity of early Leonard Cohen, it opens closer to ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" with the carnivalesque swirl of its title track. The subtle electronics, droning cello and martial toms call to mind the work of Truckstop labelmates Pinetop Seven. ""Here's another song about an old hotel/ A place you can rise in, the same place you fell/ To get lost in solitude and saved by yourself/ And did I mention I'm alone as well"" begins Joyner, immediately setting the tone for all that follows. The rest of the album's 77 minutes are a lot less musically active, often stretching barebones arrangements over the course of six or seven minutes. And if Hotel Lives fails anywhere, it's in its overwhelming length. Still, despite its epic breadth, there are more than enough breathtakingly intimate moments to keep you from leaving, and further listens reveal infinite layers of subtle feedback, manipulation and countermelody. Lonberg-Holm's arrangements are subtle to the point that you barely notice the warm horns and strings of ""Now We Must Face Each Other,"" but it's hard to imagine the song without those elements. The song's subject never casts an eye back over his shoulder as he leaves the life of another in shambles. ""Why must you turn everything beautiful ugly/ And everything ugly so hideous?"" Joyner accuses at the beginning, backed only by a spare acoustic guitar. ""Will you ever tire of digesting the flesh/ Long enough to investigate the soul/ Or are you like the amnesiac goldfish/ Always surprised to find yourself in a bowl?"" he ends as the arrangement collapses into dust. Joyner's voice breaks all over the middle of the album, cracking with exhaustion and sorrow at every turn of phrase. This hotel is the same one that Jeff Tweedy wrote ""Someone Else's Song"" in, the one where Smog had his first conference with death, and the place where Tindersticks used to reside before they discovered 70's soul. Somewhere in the woods behind the parking lot, the Oldham brothers sit around a fire howling and strumming guitars deep into the night. The atmosphere of ""How I Regret That I've Done Wrong"" recalls the odd combination of junkyard ambience and traditionalism of Califone, while the loose rhythms and light strumming of ""My Life Is Sweet"" nudge along a vocal that sometimes resembles the tumbling delivery of vintage Bob Dylan. The song is perfectly placed to break up the brooding atmosphere, though the lyrics don't flinch in their wrenching account of alcoholism: ""I got on my hands and on my knees/ And I asked the floor for release/ I was so heavy it felt like I was being squeezed/ Through the cracks in the wood into the black underneath."" ""You, David, Maria, & Me"" drags itself into bed on the back of a tired slide guitar worthy of David Roback or Rainer Ptacek, incorporating tape noise into the arrangement as well. The junkyard ambience of the second half of the album means that Hotel Lives actually gets better and fuller as it progresses, a technique that allows you to listen to the whole thing at once. Still, it's best digested in two forty-minute pieces, as spending too much time at once in Joyner's room can be somewhat taxing on the nerves. Time issues aside, though, once you've let Simon Joyner hold you in his poetic grip, you're likely to return for more very soon. And with collaborators like Lonberg-Holm, Guillermo Gregorio, and Krassner on hand, his careful documents of each stumble and insecurity of the transients in his world are fleshed to perfection. ""Listen all you lovers and would-be lovers to my tale/ The moral of my story is not hidden/ Though there are some lies along the way to disguise the details/ The broad strokes of this picture shall render its true meaning,"" he sings on the closer, ""Geraldine."" When the song is over, you realize he's telling the truth. Joyner's hotel lives may not be ones you'd want to live, but when rendered so skillfully, they're easy to love.","The wallpaper is rippled from its age, sagging and pregnant with the water leaking in from above.

It's Spooky,Jad Fair,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd295e6ef95969322fd7/1:1/w_160/74bf5aec.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2957-its-spooky/,JagjaguwarJagjaguwar,"Whoever thought of getting Daniel Johnston and Jad Fair together was a cold-hearted motherfucker. Johnston, a schizophrenic manic-depressive who believes he will be resurrected 100 years after his death to tour with the Beatles and the Butthole Surfers, and Fair, an eccentric, compulsive songwriter with bad taste in eyewear and a penchant for ranting senselessly, could not possibly be good for each other, or music in general. Maybe Jad just wanted to see if he could outcrazy Johnston. But such a thing is not possible, even for a guy that's made an album of monster songs for children and sports a frizzy homeless-guy hairdo. Some might think this is a perfectly acceptable match of talents. After all, both musicians often sing about the simple pleasures in life, like falling in love, having fun, and witnessing the apocalypse; they often sing in extreme tenors that sound closer to 11-year-olds' than 40-year-olds'; and they're both sometimes brutally irritating. But after 31 tracks and 70 minutes, you'll realize that this is not natural. Still, It's Spooky stands as the definitive recording of both artists' solo output. Its eternal length is just a testament to the boundless insanity raging within Daniel Johnston's confused mind. This is, after all, primarily Johnston's album, since he wrote the majority of its songs. You always hear stories about Johnston being ""insane."" For years, I disregarded them as legend or exaggeration. But any interview with the man will easily convince you otherwise as he discusses his many selves and his delusional battles with Lucifer with deadpan conviction. He never seems even remotely lucid, and has spent several years of his life institutionalized. What a lot of people don't realize is that most of the songs that sound to the casual listener like nauseatingly twee homages to cartoons are actually deeply personal insights into his hallucinatory existence. ""Frankenstein Vs. the World"" is a tale of the end times, in which the resurrected Johnston will destroy the planet. ""Hands of Love"" reveals his fear that he's too deranged to ever find love. ""Casper the Friendly Ghost,"" which is the name he's given to the Daniel Johnston that will exist after his body dies, pertains to how people who mistreat him in life will respect him when he's gone. The title track consists of every day musings like, ""Sometimes when I'm watching television/ I think that most of the people in the movie are probably dead."" It's obviously impossible for us to relate to his demented ruminations, but you've got to have sympathy for someone so absolutely mental. Even Johnston's covers generally have deep meaning for him. 60's troubadour Phil Ochs' ""Chords of Fame"" warns about the dangers of success destroying talent, something Johnston fears could happen to him. ""Kicking the Dog,"" originally by 80's indie rockers Glass Eye, relates to his affection for ""Laurie,"" a girl he was once (and probably still is) obsessed with. Others are taken out of their natural context or twisted into dark views of humanity. Johnston alters the lyrics to Bacharach's ""What the World Needs Now"" to reflect the casual degeneration of society (""We've got enough pornography/ There is x-rated theaters everywhere/ Lord knows we've got enough crackhouses/ There are crackhouses on every block""). The Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is inverted from an ecstatic acid endorsement to panicked paranoia, ending with Johnston screaming: ""No, no! Ladies and gentlemen! Do not surrender to the void! Darkness surrounds you! Don't relax! You'll never get out of that pit!"" Other tracks are considerably more balanced, often recalling actual events. ""I Met Roky Erickson"" is a play-by-play account about how his friendship with the similarly crackbrained recluse came to fruition (and about how Erickson's mother made them chicken). ""McDonald's on the Brain"" is a terrible a cappella recollection of his mid-80's fast food career. The plodding ""I Did Acid with Caroline,"" which offers one rage-inducing chord strummed for almost the song's entire duration, is a harmless but creepy remembrance of a romantic drug experience. (""We were one!/ We were one!"") Johnston's irrelevant ramblings are often redeemed by his knack for writing great melodies, and the voyeuristic thrill of listening to a crazy man's musical therapy. And often, Jad Fair refines Johnston's melodies in their collaborations. ""Tongues Wag in This Town,"" ""Villian,"" and the saddening ""Nothing Left"" are great examples of the two working toward a common goal. But on later tracks, particularly the unlistenable megaphone madness of ""Fan and Games,"" Fair tries too hard at avant-garde and winds up with something you wouldn't even wish upon Anthony Michael Hall. It's Spooky was recorded in one week (including mixing) and it shows. Any of these tracks could have been infinitely better had they been fleshed out and perfected. Johnston's drumming is really quite awful, and in some instances, seems to be doing its own thing entirely. Fair had actually intended for the two to work more extensively on the project and smooth things out, but the notoriously non-team-playing Johnston insisted that the project be finished by the time he left town. Beneath the din of disorganization, there are really some excellent songs. It's easy to let Johnston's delirious vocals and hapless meter get in the way-- in fact, they're totally unavoidable. But at their core, these tracks offer insight into a day in the life of a morbidly brainsick individual, and do so with infectious pop tunes you won't be able to shake for days. I can't say I'll listen to it much, but if ever there were evidence that mental illness is contagious, it's just been reissued.","Whoever thought of getting Daniel Johnston and Jad Fair together was a cold-hearted motherfucker.

Live at Jittery Joe's,Jeff Mangum,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38a5e6ef95969323861/1:1/w_160/eaadf20c.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5070-live-at-jittery-joes/,Orange Twin,"Once upon a time, singer/songwriters walked the Earth proudly. Armed with acoustic guitars and words of personal experience and political protest, they set out to teach the world how to think, feel, and listen. Fortunately, the Earth caught on pretty quickly, and it soon became apparent that scraggly individuals whining about failed romances and their inability to pay rent can only entertain for so long. Without the benefit of a massive meteor to help thin their ranks, singer/songwriters were left largely to wander the streets, looking for coffeehouses and bars where they could force their misery upon unsuspecting patrons. Live at Jittery Joe's is a decent-quality recording of a man playing an acoustic guitar and singing at a local coffee bar. But this is not by any stretch of the imagination typical singer/songwriter fare. This is Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum spinning his unique, beautifully tangled web of visceral flesh imagery, odes to Anne Frank, and cryptic, vivid storytelling. The material on Live at Jittery Joe's, which was recorded after the release of Neutral Milk Hotel's debut 1996 debut, On Avery Island, but before the release of their masterwork, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, consists largely of material culled from these two albums, as well as a few unreleased tracks and a cover of Phil Spector's ""I Love How You Love Me."" The set starts out with a version of ""A Baby for Pree"" and a shortened, heavily altered version of ""Where You'll Find Me Now,"" a two-song sort-of-suite from On Avery Island. Mangum heavily alters the lyrics of ""Where You'll Find Me Now"" to include lines like, ""I will be strong/ Strong enough to shout/ Above your voice that's blaring on/ With your face that's falling out/ Into the dust of what you are."" The lyrics don't approach the beauty of those in original version of the song, buy they afford it a fresh, stream-of-consciousness feel that makes it somehow more affecting. Another song to appear in a different form on Live at Jittery Joe's is ""Two-Headed Boy Part 2"" from In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, possibly the most heart-wrenching moment to be found on that album, and one of a very small number of songs that has been known to move my cold, cynical self to tears. Introduced as a song about ""a family that lived in the 1940's in Europe,"" ""Two-Headed Boy Part 2,"" like many of Mangum's songs, transmits raw emotion through cryptic, evocative lyrics. When he sings, ""In my dreams you're alive/ And you're crying/ Move your mouth into mine/ Soft and sweet,"" his voice aches with an intensity that seems to defy the limits of human emotion and expressiveness. The acoustic treatment fits some album cuts better than others. Tracks like ""Gardenhead"" and ""King of Carrot Flowers Parts 2 & 3"" lose a good deal of their impact without the fuzzy, explosive backing found on the album versions. But songs like ""Oh Comely"" and ""Two-Headed Boy,"" both of which appear on Aeroplane as essentially acoustic numbers, gain a harshness from the live treatment that suits them perfectly. And then there are the unreleased tracks. ""I Will Bury You in Time"" is the only Mangum original that's available only on this recording, and it unfortunately fails to stand up against the featured album tracks. Perhaps the only Neutral Milk Hotel song I've heard that sounds awkward and clumsy, ""I Will Bury You in Time"" is definitely on the weaker end of unreleased Neutral Milk Hotel song-spectrum (my two personal favorites being ""Oh Sister"" and ""Little Birds,"" both of which can be found on live bootlegs). A much better non-album track comes with ""Engine,"" a b-side from the ""Holland, 1945"" seven-inch that recently appeared on a Merge Records compilation. Written as a song for children, ""Engine"" contains fanciful yet typically strange lyrics about, among other things, round captains talking to tigers from cafeteria trays. More importantly, ""Engine"" has one of the most haunting melodies I've ever heard, ensuring that those odd, vivid images won't be leaving you any time soon. Rounding off the unreleased portion of Live at Jittery Joe's is Jeff Mangum's cover of the Phil Spector classic ""I Love How You Love Me."" Mangum's voice absolutely brings the song to life, making Spector's simple words seem profound and beautiful. Of course, the true brilliance of Jeff Mangum is that everything he sings sounds profound and beautiful. His lyrics are visceral and unique, but it's the wrenchingly powerful way in which he sings them that makes them resonate so intensely. Live at Jittery Joe's certainly resonates, but a few weak tracks, some intrusive crowd noise, and the informative-yet-distracting between-song banter prevents it from striking with the power of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. But that's not the point. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea will always stand as a perfect example of Jeff Mangum's almost superhuman talents as a singer and songwriter. Live at Jittery Joe's documents a less refined, more casual side of Mangum, and does a pretty damned good job of it. I get the feeling that this show wasn't recorded with ""live album"" in mind, and that element of candidness makes it essential for Neutral Milk Hotel fans such as myself, who weren't lucky enough to see Jeff in concert. Even with the candid and casual nature of this recording, there remains an element of mystery and otherworldiness to Jeff Mangum. Live at Jittery Joe's comes with some gorgeous video footage of the entire performance. Very dark and difficult to make out, Mangum's face appears as little more than a shadow, writhing in time with the alarmingly affecting words he sings-- almost as if the words are being driven by an intangible force. And it's these moments, when it's hard to separate the mystery from the humanity, that make the album absolutely worthwhile.","Once upon a time, singer/songwriters walked the Earth proudly.

The Death of a Girl EP,Vue,by: Samir Khan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a97dea9e61561daa5a45/1:1/w_160/062e7d74.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8504-the-death-of-a-girl-ep/,Gold Standard LaboratoriesGold Standard Laboratories,"Everyone, even the most hoity of music lovers has a conception of what a Big Bad Band should be. Some like the brash trash of the Stooges and the young Rolling Stones. Others like the intricate insanity of crotch exhibitionists like the Jesus Lizard. Some like the full-on badness of mental patients like the Shaggs or Wesley Willis. Like many of the forbearers, Vue assumes the pose of a bad band. Bad in terms of heavy eyeliner, black leather jackets, and cocaine snorted off the backs of assorted groupies backstage. Fun-time bad. Kick-ass bad. Little girl-lusting bad. Sorry, guys-- this kind of badness is getting a bit tired as the years go by. But while hardly original, Vue is exceedingly good at replicating the style of music they're attempting. Unlike some rock-punk revivalists that try to get by on leather pants and leopard-skin man-bras, Vue actually has the chops and attitude to summon some genuinely enjoyable (if fleeting) moments. From the first track of this EP, the tone is set. ""Child for You"" could be the smash-up derby song of the summer (if this was summer), packed with blustery guitar, possessed screaming, and drums that sound like they were played by the world's most slack-jawed drummer. ""Hush Your Friend"" rides shotgun in a tank top and pink lipstick, replete with sped up rockabilly beats and horny moans. Eventually, things slow down a bit on ""The Death of a Girl."" The song begins with a slow, church organ drone as frontman Rex Shelverton wails, Mark Arm-style. Throughout, the band throws in enough passion and unexpected changes to make it seem worth your time. Aided by thoroughly trashy production that brings out all the right guitar chords, it's all very Bad stuff. I have no suggestions about how to make Vue more original or innovative, but judging from the results of this disc, they'd piss on me if I tried. I suppose that suits most people just fine.","Everyone, even the most hoity of music lovers has a conception of what a Big Bad Band should be. Some ...

The World Won't End,Pernice Brothers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03a9d034d5c69bf2679/1:1/w_160/c2602346.gif,2001-06-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6238-the-world-wont-end/,Ashmont,"Joe Pernice sure is miserable. And I don't mean just a little sad or having an off day-- the guy is flat-out depressed, waiting for his life to end. At least this is the impression I get from listening to his records. This is the guy who once opened an album by intoning ""I hate my life"" over a dirge-like pop arrangement. Perhaps he's not actually that miserable and it's just his flair for melodrama that makes his situation seem so dire. On ""Our Time Has Passed,"" he describes breaking up with his girlfriend, comparing it to ""a flash of radiation that leaves the buildings where they stand."" Pernice fills 11 songs with exactly this kind of sentiment on his second outing with the Pernice Brothers, the inaugural release from Pernice's own Ashmont Records. The World Won't End bounds in with the perfect pop of ""Working Girls,"" which finds Pernice mulling the life of a lowly temp with lines like, ""She summered every winter through a calendar from paradise/ ""I was here,"" she scribbled in a restroom to prove she was alive/ All the working girls are fine/ Sunlight sun shines/ Contemplating suicide or a graduate degree."" The six-piece band perversely backs this up with a peppy arrangement, setting up the fundamental tension that makes this a successful record. Combining depressing themes with infectious melodies and jubilant music is hardly anything new-- Bobby Darin nearly perfected it in his too-brief career decades ago; early They Might Be Giants records still stand as a fine example-- but the band and their conspirators (a total of ten people) give the music just the right edge of melancholy when it needs it. This usually comes in the form of David Trenholm's restrained string quartet arrangements. For the most part, the band also avoids the elevator-ready patches that tainted their debut. Producer Thom Monahan, a long-time cohort of Pernice from his days in the Scud Mountain Boys, lends the album an autumnal sound that smacks of recent efforts by Archer Prewitt; you get the sense that the leaves are turning outside, and the temperature dropping. It's probably safe to imagine that the band, most of them New England natives, feel at home with a sound that evokes that kind of imagery. For his part, Pernice keeps on spinning out winning break-up songs and thanatopses, such as ""Flaming Wreck,"" in which he details his final thoughts (""I'm alright"") as his aircraft plunges five miles into the ground, killing all aboard. His sometimes ragged vocals receive some welcome help here as well, with most of the band harmonizing gorgeously on the refrain. It's this and countless other moments that offer insight into the meaning of the album title: the world won't end; it already has. But even though Pernice's lyrics threaten to turn into a pity party at any second, the ebullient music that backs him always comes up strong, providing concentrated multi-vitamin blasts of delicious pop. And at the end, the record's closer, ""Cronulla Breakdown,"" marries a closing-time-at-the-hotel-lounge delivery with a fabulous Beatlesque melody, proffering a final swipe at failed relationships with the line, ""We try so hard to make the worst of a bad situation,"" summing it all up over bongos and acoustic guitar. It all amounts to what, for me, is the best record Pernice & Co. have made yet. Though it had its moments, I was never in love with the Scud Mountain Boys' brand of jazzy country, nor with Pernice's slow-core Chappaquiddick Skyline project. Here, however, he and his latest band seem to have found a comfortable vehicle for delivering his world-weary messages, and the results are definitely worth hearing.","Joe Pernice sure is miserable.

A Celebratory Arm Gesture,Summer Hymns,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a8b1335d7bf1698c55/1:1/w_160/43cb54d1.gif,2001-06-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7565-a-celebratory-arm-gesture/,Misra,"Right now, I'm smiling. It's a shame you can't see this; cynical, embittered individuals like myself are rarely subject to ear-to-ear Cheshire Cat grins. But listening to A Celebratory Arm Gesture, I can't help but be happy. Really happy. Another beautiful record has entered my life, and I have no intention of letting it go any time soon. This isn't the first time Summer Hymns has done this to me. In the year or so since it was released, Summer Hymns' brilliant debut album, Voice Brother and Sister, has become not only one of my favorite albums in recent memory, but one of the few albums that can make me feel good every time I listen to it. Voice Brother and Sister remains, in many ways, the perfect summer record-- the hazy, gorgeous melodies and slurred psychedelic production affords it an inexplicable quality of heat and comfort. Considering all this, it's not surprising my expectations for A Celebratory Arm Gesture were ridiculously high. It's one of the few albums I've actually spent a good deal of time worrying about before hearing. Voice Brother and Sister seemed like such a perfect one-shot album-- the band name, the album art, and the beautiful songs, some of which had been floating around in lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter Zachary Gresham's head since high school. Honestly, I wasn't sure if they'd be able to pull it off again. And in some ways, I was right. A Celebratory Arm Gesture is certainly not a sequel to Voice Brother and Sister. The production is much cleaner and the album as a whole seems decidedly less psychedelic. More importantly, perhaps, A Celebratory Arm Gesture sounds much more like a band record than Voice Brother and Sister, with each individual musician contributing his or her own unique influence to the record's sound. Though the production on A Celebratory Arm Gesture is cleaner than on Voice Brother and Sister, the songs have grown more complex. But never do they sacrifice the seamless melodies and diverse instrumentation that truly made their debut great. ""Something's Going On,"" the song that originally bore the title of the album itself, manages to be both tremendously sophisticated and instantly accessible. Derek Almstead's flowing, highly melodic basslines are a key part of A Celebratory Arm Gesture's sound, and ""Something's Going On"" features two of his finest. But Almstead's playing is only icing on the sweet, sweet cake of Zachary Gresham's songwriting skills. ""Something's Going On,"" like many of the album's finer tracks, has several distinct parts, including a flat-out gorgeous bridge with a flute melody and lyrics like, ""As long as there are words/ And one breath left in me/ There will always be one more song for you."" On the slower and more melancholy side of A Celebratory Arm Gesture are two hazy, contemplative ballads, ""I Could Give the World Away"" and ""Closure Eyes."" The former features an almost Mazzy Star-ish wash of slide guitar, harmonica, organ, and strummed acoustic guitar-- one of the most affecting, bittersweet moments of A Celebratory Arm Gesture. ""Closure Eyes"" opens with a fluttering piano melody, swells of slide guitar, and a descending bassline that perfectly matches Gresham's sad, enchanting lyrics. At the four minute mark, the song shifts into a tottering guitar drone with marching band-inspired snare drum fills. Soon, a burbling analog synth comes in, segueing perfectly into the record's most surprising track, the melodic IDM of ""The Daybreak."" Glitchy and warm, ""The Daybreak"" would actually be more at home on a Boards of Canada LP. Just as Voice Brother and Sister was a perfectly constructed album, every aspect of A Celebratory Arm Gesture seems to fit together without flaw. The sequencing begins with more upbeat numbers and gradually segues into the complex ""Something's Going On,"" and finishes with the bittersweet beauty of ""I Could Give the World Away"" and ""Closure Eyes,"" each track interspersed with other gorgeous songs and instrumentals. Also, as with its predecessor, A Celebratory Arm Gesture's cover art seems perfectly matched to the album itself, combining nature and wildlife with hazy urban landscapes. Rather than falling into the dreaded sophomore slump, Summer Hymns have accomplished a truly impressive feat: transcending their bandname to create a perfect record for all seasons.","Right now, I'm smiling.

"A Flat Inside a Fog, The Cat That Was a Dog",Bablicon,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e613d197565213873a/1:1/w_160/98a0fed0.gif,2001-06-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/510-a-flat-inside-a-fog-the-cat-that-was-a-dog/,MisraMisra,"An air of mystery surrounds Bablicon, and it goes much deeper than band members naming themselves Blue Hawaii, the Dimisher and Marta Tennae. For one thing, it's just about impossible to figure out what the hell they're up to. They have one member of Neutral Milk Hotel (drummer Tennae, who is known as Jeremy Barnes outside of Bablicon); other members have a background in the Chicago improv scene. Together, they are making music. Not rock music, not electronic music, not folk music, not jazz music, though, at various points, they might be doing any one of those things. Just music. Any modifier you might attach to the word limits it, which would simply not do. No limitations, no boundaries-- this seems to be the Bablicon creed. After last year's The Orange Tapered Moon-- which found the band making smart use of electronics in addition to channeling the emotion of Albert Ayler and the surrealism of Beefheart-- Bablicon return in 2001 with a dense album seemingly inspired by silent film scores, German cabaret, and vaudeville, while still incorporating noisy interludes and assorted indescribable fragments. Many of the tunes on the first half of A Flat Inside a Fog, The Cat That Was a Dog are dominated by piano, with a wide variety of instruments outlining dissonant, haunting melodies that seem remembered from a flickering black-and-white past. Strings supplied by the ""Alien Orchestra,"" and even greater deployment of multi-tracked harmonized reed lines, makes this band seem much larger than it actually is. On this record, Bablicon are like the house band from a nickel cinema learning how to incorporate field recordings and free jazz into their sound. But the strangest thing is that these tunes, many of which seem to be working in a long-forgotten tradition, don't feel nostalgic or tied to any particular era. Though the music sounds only a little like Tom Waits, Bablicon have a similar knack for using ""old"" elements and in ways that the originators never could have imagined. Kurt Weill never had the opportunity to run an organ through a distortion pedal. W.C. Handy died before lungs-out blowing became as valid as melody. Richard Strauss never wrote charts under the influence of LSD. And so on. As on The Orange Tapered Moon, The Cat That Was a Dog opens with a vocal track called ""Blue Hawaii,"" which recalls an old showtune. ""Traveling"" could be a Gershwin interlude played on piano, bass, clarinet and soprano saxophone, with the feel of the old south, sweaty and evocative. ""Animals"" is the first track to feature the Alien Orchestra, possibly a string quartet recorded to sound distant and thin. Opening with field recordings of a train station, ""Saumar/Paris/Tea Towels"" becomes a bouncy sax instrumental, moves back to atmospheric sound, and then tacks on another brilliant section of Aylerian folk played on c melody and soprano sax and oboe by the Dimisher. Perhaps sensing that they had too many musical ideas to stuff into the 36 minutes of last year's record, A Flat Inside a Fog is 65 minutes long with lots of weird experimental tracks that some might describe as ""filler,"" but which I term ""the good stuff."" ""Smell of Ovoustic"" is heavily treated tapes of a clarinet, sounding like an early synthesizer recording meant to mimic the sound of deep space. Another brief highlight is ""Ape Hall,"" 32 seconds of manipulated orchestra recordings-- perhaps the sound of an early talkie being munched in a projector. For all the cinematic references, it's true that A Flat Inside a Fog works best in a single sitting, heard to start to finish. These fragments and detours start to make sense when lined up in a row, as the mood crests and falls with the incredibly varied music. Bablicon may remain an enigma, but the music speaks for itself rather well.","An air of mystery surrounds Bablicon, and it goes much deeper than band members naming themselves Blue Hawaii, the Dimisher ...

Crane Wars,Beans,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23db1335d7bf169844d/1:1/w_160/d5565c58.gif,2001-06-15 06:01:40,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/602-crane-wars/,Zum,"The words ""Crane Wars"" conjure images of urban destruction for me. The cover art for the Beans' second album features a photograph of a dilapidated high-rise. It's unclear whether the frame is being built up, torn down, or refurbished. The back cover contrasts two photographs: one of a diesel-powered truck in a hazardous waste zone; the other of a verdant rainforest. As I open the jewel case, I'm expecting an album of violent extremes, a force that uses its constructive tools to demolish itself. But, silkscreened on the compact disc, the image of a cartoonish bird crane appears, head down. And that figure serves better as a metaphor for my disappointment with this record. Beans are a five-piece group from Vancouver, British Columbia. They approach music improvisationally, rarely playing a song the same way twice. Local musicians add color to the compositions, bringing their own array of instruments. So it bothers me that, from such a range of possibilities, they've sequenced their three least original pieces first. ""Windows y Tower"" kicks things off with horn blasts at irregular intervals. If this is found sound, it's more ""high school band tuning time' than ""The National Anthem."" There's silence, then minimal guitar and bassline interplay, followed finally by some pretty intense drumming. But the lead guitarist has this annoying habit of trilling out series of notes, and the band doesn't back him up by giving this song the climax it deserves. Instead, a violin tries its best to climb to A Silver Mt. Zion, and just ends up as haze hovering below. It all ends somewhere near the 12-minute mark. ""Slow Recovery"" builds similarly. Mournful guitars elicit comparisons to that other gloomy Canadian collective, until, I kid you not, someone decides to fade in three minutes of Aphex Twin's ""Metal Grating"" from Selected Ambient Works Volume II. Beans' use of samples works when employed with more subtlety, though, from drops of rain to occasional Nintendo beeps and cupboard creaks. Other times, it just sounds like they've left the television on, or let a burglar fumble about their living room while the cat walks across the piano. ""Boston RWA"" begins with a nasty chainsaw sound, evoking the industrial fetishism they've been hinting at. Unfortunately, after minutes of aimless guitar meandering, and even a nice, thick bassline which meshes with some progressive drumming, the band plasters on a trumpet chorus from Cerberus Shoal for a pleasing but highly derivative tempo change. This could have been a great song without the intrusion of the album's first lyrics, but the lead singer finds the worst possible vocal affection to deliver the already weak line, ""I think I'll stop loving you."" Why the curious, eerie pieces were hidden as the last few tracks is beyond me. ""I Breathe the Air (From Other Planets)"" wafts up on the breaths of sampled operatic voices, and suddenly, discordant piano accents dance with drums, like a creepy carnival parade heard from a block away. The contemplative guitar chords and tinny drums of ""Vent du Nord"" make it the most simple work on the album, and it calms like the best of Yo La Tengo's later records. Finally, ""Hollow Stars"" is a tapestry of sounds as heard by an infant trying to make sense of its tenement building: female vocals coo, synths shift ground slowly, and a drum machine and live percussionist weave together soft jungle rhythms to create a beautiful lullaby. I mentioned earlier that Crane Wars disappointed me. It's not a bad album, but the band's sound doesn't seem its own, and the production isn't hi-fi enough to flesh their sound out. Much of the time they utilize toy-machine crane-arm tactics, piecing together whatever the clumsy claw picks up. The fact that one bandmember, Tygh Runyan, periodically leaves to act in films like Antitrust no doubt adds to the disjointedness. Beans don't come across as star side projects like Dogstar, though. While it's great that rock bands are decentralizing their structure and exploring diverse styles of playing as if it were natural, few people are interested in weak jam-band collages. Albums like this frustrate me, because with more concentration Beans could become a wrecking ball that demolishes all in its path.","The words ""Crane Wars"" conjure images of urban destruction for me.

Trad, trad, it ain't a fad! I look around the room-- a gymnasium moonlighting as a convention center. Needless to say, this is my first ""trad-rock"" convention (I lost a card game at Pitchfork HQ). The gym is packed with 17-year-old British boys (I threw the game) cheering with youthful enthusiasm. I take a quick survey of the t-shirts in the room-- Ocean Colour Scene, Travis, Kula Shaker, and Oasis. One boy sports the words TRAD IS RAD on his chest, but the more humble TRAD'S NOT THAT BAD seems to be the tee of choice. I have no idea what the fuck is going on. So I ask the kid next to me, ""Hey, you, what's this trad?"" He meets my question with a blank stare. I explain, ""I'm from out of town."" Still no response. ""I'm American."" Only now does my ignorance seem feasible. ""Oh."" He finally opens up. ""Trad-rock is... well... it's not really Britpop. But you know trad bands... like the Chieftains-- they play traditional music. So, trad-rock is really traditional rock and roll."" To clarify, I ask him, ""So, you guys are into the Stones and Led Zeppelin?"" He laughs a knowing laugh and replies slowly, ""Don't you see? We're living in a post-Oasis world."" I take a loop around and see a listening station. Fran Healy of Travis is scheduled as the convention's keynote speaker, and I haven't even heard their third album, The Invisible Band. So I put on the headphones and sit down. The opening track and first single, ""Sing,"" shows off a banjo, and rejoices with a honeyball of a singalong chorus that proclaims, ""The love you bring won't mean a thing/ Unless you/ Sing, sing, sing."" As cheesy as the song is, there's no denying that Healy can sing-- his voice is both easy on the ears and passionately expressive. It somehow comforts with a wisdom and maturity that his banal lyrics ultimately betray. ""Dear Diary"" opens with the lines, ""Dear Diary, what is wrong with me?/ 'Cos I'm fine between the lines/ Be not afraid/ Help is on its way."" While I'd be embarrassed to read that in an actual diary-- let alone in liner notes-- the sparse production is precise to an almost chilling effect, and Healy's impressive falsetto pulls it off convincingly. Fran also keeps the song short enough that you're more likely to remember the effect of his gentle, wavering vocals than his questionable, drippy sentiments. By the third track, The Invisible Band's feeling pretty predictable. The songs are solid, but the band seem more to have found a formula that works than an individual voice. Travis' roots lie in Paul McCartney (think Wings rather than the Beatles), and post-Style Council Paul Weller, but they also seem influenced by contemporaries such as Oasis and The Bends-era Radiohead. The guitar milks a few melodic themes, so that many of the songs lack distinction. The tracks here are supported by a fuller sound and more complex arrangements than on either of Travis' first two albums. Banjos, synthetic orchestrations, and studio add-ins are employed to create a lush sound that's enjoyable at the cost of the punch of Good Feeling or the dark mood of The Man Who. They're all competently played, but never really inspiring. ""Flowers in the Window (for Nora)"" is a rare break in the formula. The driving chorus, ""Oh, wow, look at you now, flowers in the window/ It's such a lovely day, and I'm glad you feel the same,"" is a bit ridiculous, which for a band like Travis is a serious risk. But on an album that otherwise feels too safe, their grand victory romp seems innocently fun. Imagine a melody similar to the Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City"" if it were written like a showtune. And performed by Glaswegians. I don't mind Travis. There are many far worse bands, and it's hard to go wrong with a humble, talented singer, a band who likes rock, Nigel Godrich and some synthesizers. But Travis doesn't ever seem to say much, so I don't think I'm going to stick around for Healy's keynote speech. The music makes me want to listen, but I just can't hear much of impact in the vague stream of lyrical clichés: ""The grass is always greener on the other side""; ""There is no wrong, there is no right""; ""I'd pray to God if there was heaven, but heaven seems so very far from here""; ""You are one in a million, and I love you, so let's watch the flowers grow""; ""When your bird has flown away, she was never meant to stay""; ""Everyday in every way I'm falling..."" Such pleasant sentiments will do well on the charts, but regardless of how many weeks they battle it out with Muse and the Stereophonics, it won't be enough for history to notice them. The Invisible Band, indeed. It's poignant, almost. I still don't know what a ""trad"" is.","*Trad, trad, it ain't a fad!

Time Travel is Lonely,John Vanderslice,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a913b1335d7bf1699427/1:1/w_160/a846e283.gif,2001-06-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8400-time-travel-is-lonely/,Barsuk,"Late breaking news from The Globe: ""John Vanderslice is known for playing jokes. In his former band, MK Ultra, he attempted to convince people with their 1996 sophomore release, Actual Motion Picture Soundtrack, that the record was a real soundtrack for a yet-to-be released independent film. With his song ""Bill Gates Must Die,"" from his solo debut, 2000's Mass Suicide Occult Figurines, he wrote up a fake summons from Microsoft's legal department and got into the papers pretending to be sued by the monopoly (sorry, guys) for the song's content. ""But now, his greatest hoax of all has finally hit the record shelves. Time Travel is Lonely may have been released under the name John Vanderslice, and it may sound like John Vanderslice, but the fact is that Vanderslice had no part in the making of the record! ...For the vocal tracks this time around, Vanderslice's engineering team of John Croslin and Scott Solter used Skywalker Sound in Los Angeles instead of the humble facilities of Tiny Telephone in San Francisco, his usual analog studio. At Skywalker, they created a digital amalgamation between Jeremy Enigk and Katherine Hepburn to recreate his heavily affected singing style. 'We scanned their pronunciation patterns, then used Pro Tools to slow it down,' said Croslin. 'It was like a pitch-perfect Vanderslice. I'm still amazed by how lifelike it sounds.' ...Vanderslice could not be reached for comment, but a source confirms that he's on an isolated retreat to Antarctica..."" John Vanderslice's first album, Mass Suicide Occult Figurines, was not exactly an exercise in cohesion. The songs jumped from acoustic balladry to power alt-rock, from lo-fi synth-pop to chamber-string melancholy within the course of less than 30 minutes, with no element to tie them together. The songs were great, but they didn't make much of a whole. On Time Travel is Lonely, the thematic, cohesive side of solo John Vanderslice finally shows itself. The record kicks off with ""You Were My Fiji,"" the first song Vanderslice recorded after the release of his debut. The song features Jeff Mangum-esque wailing and lo-fi acoustic guitars, but with a percussive, upbeat tempo and efficiency that's decidedly un-Neutral Milk Hotel. From there, it takes off into a record full of similarly bittersweet, remorseful pop songs, and this time, it sounds like they were all born to be on the same record together. Vanderslice is clearly enthused about the recording process, and he's involved every step of the way. Like his debut, Time Travel is Lonely was committed to tape in his own Tiny Telephone analog studios in San Francisco with the help of engineers Scott Solter and John Croslin. The new album is also more fully deserving of ""solo record"" status; although it does feature supporting players (on electric guitar, bass and drums), the majority of the record was played by Vanderslice himself. As the basis of his songs, he provides acoustic guitar, Moogs and mellotrons, along with the occasional Rhythm Ace drum machine track and quirky sound effect. He may be a singer/songwriter, but he seems to be more in the game simply for the pure love of sound, taking it from all sources. On one hand, he samples various materials for the record's three interludes-- two of them being classical recordings-- adapting and layering upon them as if they were his own. ""Interlude 2,"" which puzzlingly comes later in the record than ""Interlude 3,"" uses a harpsichord recording of Bach's ""Preludium Fugue #7"" and adds warped delay, switched-on synth accompaniment, and a self-tracked choir for a fantastically eerie effect. On another hand, for the rocking title track, he samples the sound of a camera flash recharging and loops it to add punch to the power-pop chorus. The source of the effect is offbeat, but the sound is genuinely effective. On Time Travel is Lonely, he explores lyrical concepts of isolation, remembrance and loss. The melodies generally maintain an optimistic major key, and the spacy interludes instrumentally support what the lyrics represent. Nostalgia is a key theme here, with different facets. Some of the songs tell of lost relationships, deaths, and childhood, while some take their tales directly from literary sources. ""Little Boy Lost"" and ""If I Live or If I Die"" update somber poetry by William Blake and set them to catchy pop songs. The latter proves to be more effective, and one of the standout tracks on the record. Vanderslice sings Blake's humanist tale of the accidental death of a fly to poppy, staccato piano chords, an arpeggiating Moog bassline and exuberant handclaps. It seems, though, that Vanderslice wants Time Travel is Lonely to have more than just vague lyrical themes; he wants to take you to Antarctica. He wants you to experience the isolation from the real world that one experiences in a frigid wasteland. The packaging and liner notes prove the larger conceptual idea. The liner notes depict supposed letters from John's brother Jesse during many months living on ""a floating, unstable ice shelf."" Some of these letters seem to be the basis for the topics of some songs on the record; some others simply recall the feelings and events that would begin to cause ""polar madness."" None of them are real; for a bit of proof, lyrics that are attributed to Jesse in the letters are credited to John in the notes. But while these wouldn't be things one would guess from the non-specific theme of the lyrics, the overall concept does help it work. In fact, it helps the feeling that the happiness of the melodies are only a device for comfort, to mask the insecurity and solitude that's finally beginning to reach me after so many listens. It's like Jesse writes in his lyrics to ""Time Travel is Lonely"": ""No one has ever made it this far in time..."" and it's painfully apparent when you're alone. The rock guitars, the bittersweet melodies, the soaring synths, and the soul-baring, primitive acoustic guitars are beautiful, but I'm starting to see the true message here. Behind Vanderslice's affected voice lies a pathos, whether it's genuine or not, whether it's real. In fact, there are very brief moments where he sounds so detached, so cold, that it's not hard to imagine the voice sort of existing outside of him, or not even coming from him.","Late breaking news from The Globe: ""John Vanderslice is known for playing jokes.

At Dawn,My Morning Jacket,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42aeb335119a49ed8ae/1:1/w_160/9e5d9282.gif,2001-06-05 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5533-at-dawn/,Darla,"There's a sentence in the liner notes for At Dawn that says, ""Thanks to all the people giving us a chance to play our rock n roll in this bleeping buzzing world."" That got me to thinking, sometimes music has to be appreciated in a certain context. I saw My Morning Jacket play a show recently in Washington, D.C. Their twangy sounds seemed out of place that night, packed into a tiny club in an urban area, with car alarms blaring outside. I wanted to be kicked back on a lawn chair, sipping some MGD and wiping at sweat while these guys played from an outdoor bandstand. Something about the setting made it seem a more appropriate venue for bleeping and buzzing than alt-country. I'm glad I can give the band a second chance. Louisville, Kentucky's My Morning Jacket have packed the 74 minutes of this CD with 14 honest, straight up rock songs. Don't be confused by claims from the record label, though, that, ""This is what those Palace-whozits and indie-Americana popniks all wish their albums sounded like."" Most of the pieces have an upbeat, positive attitude, and even the slower folk songs don't attempt tortured Oldham-isms. The first song and title track actually teases with a half-minute of doomed, Palace-esque reverb and slow percussion, but warmth enters with acoustic guitar strumming and frontman Jim James' rich croon. James has a strong, unique voice, and his only fault is that he stretches out each note about as far as possible, and on the highest notes something curdles in the back of his throat and he sounds like Kermit the frog. Here, his lyrics deviate oddly from the rest of his efforts: ""They'll haul you out to the streets/ They'll burn your papers and your empty trash cans/ Beat this thought into your head/ ""All your life is obscene""/ But that's when my knife rises/ Their life ends and my life starts again."" James doesn't address that 'us vs. them' paranoia much-- he's much more the lover type, always singing about his girl. Yeah, the lyrics to ""Lowdown"" have been soaking in the trite barrel too long (""Chancin'/ Glance in/ Sho' nuff mood for romancin'""), but they're as simple as the beautiful delay effect of the pedal steel guitar notes that make this song sound so great. ""The Way That He Sings"" is full of wonder about the way songs and relationships affect us, and it's propelled by a foot-tapping snare and pleasant vocal harmonies between the guys in the band. ""Just Because I Do"" is all about drum crashes, angular guitar lines and harmonica, and shares that uplifting, devil-may-care quality that's the secret to a lot of good country and R&B.; The quieter numbers later on sound more like demos, featuring little more than James' plaintive vocals and careful picking. ""If It Smashes Down"" actually unsettles its innocent opening with a description of ""a really fast, risky ride at the fair."" Any chance of a carnival-like atmosphere is dispelled by his hesitant whimpers and howls. I wish My Morning Jacket had more of these surprises hidden in their plaid sleeves. ""Honest Man"" tries to lasso the ""classic"" Stevie Ray Vaughn blues instrumental but falls short. The solo doesn't quite go nowhere, but it's a path you've been dragged down before. Likewise, James rides the ""Sometimes I walk around town lookin' at faces/ Wonderin' why their bodies go to silly places,"" loner device into the ground. But the hidden instrumental track at the end redeems it all; each note takes on a sense of jumbled autonomy, like the music of Songs: Ohia. If you can, pick up the two-disc version of this album. The second disc is a collection of demos, some of which appear as full songs on At Dawn, and some of which are unreleased. It's not essential, but the feeling of intimacy is unparalleled. There's something about voice and acoustic guitar together that creates the impression of fullness. Maybe it's Trevor hollAnd's rich production. Regardless, My Morning Jacket could be the perfect soundtrack to a summer road trip, or just something you wrap around yourself on the way to work each morning.","There's a sentence in the liner notes for At Dawn that says, ""Thanks to all the people giving us ...

Bodily Functions,Matthew Herbert,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0bd5e6ef959693235d4/1:1/w_160/0676add9.jpg,2001-06-05 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3834-bodily-functions/,!K7,"Even your pet rock recognizes how swiftly house music plummets into formula. Let's consider the choon of 2000, Hatiras' ""Spaced Invader."" Beginning with a Todd Terry-ish rhythm loop, the track discloses its two tropes pitifully soon after. Trope one: the EQ rush (the section of a woeful number of records wherein all sound is muffled, and then rushes back into hi-fi clarity). Trope two: Atari video game melody. Actually, to use the term ""melody"" would be pushing it a bit, in this case-- the synthline that masquerades as a melody is more similar to the beeps that ""Super Breakout"" makes if you bust down walls every 40 seconds. And while being an accomplished ""Super Breakout"" player does not earn you bonus points on college applications, it does give you more kudos in certain social groups than being a renowned master in, say, booger-rolling. Anyway, video game noises in house music records are universally boring. In opposition to such facile crowd-pleasing tactics, another school of house music has arisen, and may be termed ""the Real House music movement."" These producers and DJs are usually a reactionary bunch who prefer the good ol' daze when Marshall Jefferson still ruled Ten City and Larry Heard righteously slapped down Lucifer during the ""Can You Feel It"" sermon. Notable Real House music mavens, such as Francois Kervorkian and Joe Claussell, have made commendable efforts to introduce Fela Kuti's Afrobeat and Cesaria Evora's Cape Verdean fados into their Body and Soul sessions. Regrettably, a facile bandwagoning wing of this school is content to wear out the grooves of EBTG vs. Soul Vision's officially released bootleg ""Tracy in my Room,"" Negrocan's ""Cada Vez"" and St. Germain's ""Rose Rouge."" Real House music also manifests boring tendencies. UK house and techno bod Matthew Herbert is here to save us. His house music inclines to the Real school, but commendably avoids all the hempy acid-jazz baggage and Madame Jo Jo's deep funk obscurantisms. Instead, Herbert's house is built on fractures, the shingling of cracks, clicks, and mistakes, and his partner's gorgeously melancholic torch song voice. For the foundation of Bodily Functions, Herbert has taken the title of his Tresor mix disc, Let's All Make Mistakes, quite to heart. In fact, he's developed a ten-point manifesto outlining his Personal Contract for the Composition of Music (PCCOM) that succinctly incorporates his Manifesto of Mistakes. Important PCCOM doctrinal points are as follows: \tOnly sounds that are generated at the start of the compositional \tprocess or taken from the artist's own previously unused archive \tare available for sampling. The use of, ordering and manipulation \tof noise-sound/found-sound is to be held as the highest priority \tin composition. (tenet 2) \tThe sampling of other people's music is forbidden. (tenet 3) \tNo replication of traditional acoustic instruments is allowed \twhere the financial and physical possibility of using the real ones \texists. (tenet 4) \tThe inclusion, development, propagation, existence, replication, \tacknowledgement, patterns and beauty of what are commonly known as \taccidents, is encouraged. Furthermore, they have equal rights \twithin the composition as deliberate, conscious, or premeditated \tcompositional actions or decisions. (tenet 5) In restricting the sampling of other music, tenet 3 compels Herbert to originality; tenet 4 prioritizes the sonic aura that acoustic instruments lose when crudely digitized; and tenet 5 acknowledges that unintended sounds may be essential emergent properties of the creative process. In tenet 5, Herbert doesn't go as far as William Burroughs did in explaining that his cut-ups and novels were the pressures of a demon external to him. So we know that while Herbert may be a wee bit Benedictine in his rules, he's not a paranoid conspiracy junkie nut. And on the clear evidence of Bodily Functions, these rules have gamely assisted Herbert and his collaborators to realize an undeniably beautiful artwork. ""The Last Beat"" moves away from the random scattering of glitches into a Savannah, mint-julep-sipping afternoon slow waltz with Dani Siciliano posing unanswered questions (""Are you dreaming me?/ Is this feeling you?"") to an unheard, unseen dancing partner. The graciously restrained piano chords and Barry Guy-like acoustic bass remain aloof, allowing Siciliano's vocals to be the focus of our attention. Yet, her questions are posed to us, and we're unable to grant her a single reply. Enhancing the song, Herbert's close miking of Siciliano's voice permits us to approach a contact point with her breath-- one of her/our bodily functions. The duet ""You Saw It All"" is contrastingly definite (""And though I may never see/ All that you did/ Promise me nothing more/ You saw it all"") as Luca Santucci in a mixture of plaintive and resolute tones remonstrates with Siciliano, whose one rejoinder is ""you saw it all."" This, of course, makes his gaze the authoritative version, and extinguishes her own view of the relationship. ""Suddenly"" begins as a house version of a Boomerang-era Creatures marimba ballad, but closes with a primed-for-Twilo tribal stomp dusted with clicks and an occasional soft piano chord every bit as sonorous and insistent as a Sunday morning church bell. There's nothing smooth about the languid, yearning instrumental ""About This Time Each Day,"" in which Siciliano relates a haiku-brief story with her clarinet, as Phil Parnell's piano overrides her narrative. ""I Know"" drives like a Dave Holland Quartet piece, as uncovered in one of Jan Jelinek's loop-finding-jazz-records. Beginning with another barely audible element (this mechanical churning noise is, in fact, the sound of a mouse attempting escape from a garbage can in Herbert's studio-- how about that for adhering to PCCOM tenet 5? ), ""Addiction"" peaks with Siciliano's lachrymose delivery of ""Just as I think it's done/ You're there/ Darkening the sun."" Herbert, once again the apogee of restraint, maintains the vocals' prominence by assuring that the Rhodes piano, the bass, and the percussion (this time an organized array of smashing glass bottle sounds) are more like suspicions than presences. ""Leave Me Now"" entwines two Siciliano vocals, mimicking the conflict internal to this duet: ""Still don't know me/ (Tell me what you need)/ Each roll over/ It's so over/ Can't console me."" Herbert sets these words amid a sparse click track tenderly augmented with a nearly inaudible synth pad and an occasional piano chord. This song, like the others (don't call them ""tracks"") is jazz, set in a house framework. Only Ludovic Navarre's St. Germain project has successfully negotiated the perils of this type of jazz, but without the immense benefit of a vocalist-- let alone a vocalist as affecting as Dani Siciliano. How far Siciliano has climbed from the cutesy Roisin Murphy-isms of Herbert's last offering, Around the House. Herbert's incorporating of found sounds could easily have led him into novelty. To more transcendent effect than Matmos' use of surgical sounds on A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure, Herbert's found sounds are without referential baggage. Had I not learnt about the pail-breaking mouse on ""Addiction,"" my best guess for the source would have been a turning tumble-dryer. In this reference-free manner of sound appropriation, Herbert mimics in sound what he's achieved in his lyrics. While Herbert's website espouses an overtly political message to them, the lyrics are ambiguous and indefinite. They are the all-but-blank canvas upon which each listener will form his or her own conclusion. Whether you conclude that ""Leave Me Now"" is about global warming or your pestering mother-in-law is utterly your call to make. This ambiguity is going to infuriate the literal minded, but by the inclusion of this blurriness, Herbert has distinguished himself from house music producers whose vocalists trill trite slogans of self-actualization. Bodily Functions so effectively destroys every house music cliché, from which ever school, that my Romantic self wishes just to call this album ""high art."" Bodily Functions is far and away the only jazz-informed house music album you'll ever need. I don't think what Herbert and his collaborators have achieved can soon be bested. We can only say huge prayers that other producers will be inspired to deliver this cripplingly banalized genre from its pestilent self, and slap down Lucifer once again.","Even your pet rock recognizes how swiftly house music plummets into formula.\n\ Let's consider the choon of 2000 ...

Masses,Spring Heel Jack,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5259d034d5c69bf3220/1:1/w_160/21ce3095.gif,2001-06-05 05:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7438-masses/,Thirsty Ear,"Spring Heel Jack entered the electronica scene in the mid-90's, clearly on the living-room listening side of the drum-n-bass spectrum. The beats on 1996's 68 Million Shades came complex, but despite their rapid pace the overall sonic texture was subdued, making for a smooth, pedestrian vibe. The following album, Busy Curious Thirsty, locked into the harder dance groove that was developing at the time, though a closer listen showed that the real intent was the creation of a roughened, more diverse sound. The new direction lost a lot of their audience, though, and the ambient pieces were numbingly repetitious. In a typical major label move, Island dropped the duo from its roster. Since then, John Coxon and Ashley Wales have been working hard, and each of their recent endeavors have been more successful-- from the driving, eerie Treader to the slightly softer, more cinematic Disappeared and the noisy ambient experiments collected on Oddities. They've also taken a cue from Fila Brazillia, who produced the strangely pristine luster on Greg Dulli's Twilight Singers project. Coxon & Wales collaborated with Low in 2000 on the Bombscare EP, in which all junglist tendencies vanished, subsumed into Low's stark minimalism; likewise, Alan Sparhawk & Co. found their fragile song frames reinforced by a mesh of synthetic subtlety and carefully controlled drones. The union got called ""experimental"" mostly due to the uncomfortable tension the album evoked. Masses invigorates the Thirsty Ear label's fusion project, ""The Blue Series Continuum."" Spring Heel Jack have toyed with jazz since their early days-- sampling a brassy trumpet trill here, employing a live percussion sample from Tortoise there-- but as time progressed, they showed interest in jazz as a structural template rather than cut-and-paste decoration. For Masses, they recorded a number of ambient soundscapes composed of crackling feedback and found sound (once again absent of breakbeats), and gathered choice labelmates to improvise over the recordings. Some of the most influential names in the new breed of free jazz participated, from the dynamic duo of pianist Matthew Shipp and double bassist William Parker to mercurial saxophonist Evan Parker. The result is the most intense, fascinating album of Spring Heel Jack's career. ""Chorale"" opens in static pulses. Shipp hesitantly takes lead with four- and five-note piano clusters, while William Parker's bass explores the space between the rumbling drones. One aspect of the prerecorded soundtracks is that the musicians can slow down and test intimate, abstract harmonies usually only available to duos and trios. Evan Parker's lone soprano sax line repeats after long intervals, intriguingly programmatic considering his usual repertoire. This melancholy motif is the only semblance of melody in the entire song, and the noir ambience would fit perfectly in Blade Runner when Deckard sips his drink alone in the dim living room. ""Chiaroscuro"" defines an opposite approach-- an amplified two-note bassline followed by a handclap serves as the rhythmic anchor for the entire track. Hardly boring, this relentless, aggressive reverb is the current through which Daniel Carter runs his saxophone, at first a playful expedition that becomes increasingly strained and frenetic. Guillermo Brown busts three minutes afterwards with overlapping bass-drum rolls and snares, adding to the uneasiness. Trying to isolate the organic from the preprocessed is difficult; at times, the streaks of Ed Coxon's violin blend seamlessly with the humming bed of distortion. The title track, on which all players are involved, is by far the standout. Brown plays schizophrenically liberated percussion, abusing cowbells and the drumstand itself as pianist Shipp jabs at the low register ivory keys. A sudden crescendo: seconds too late, you realize these were pebbles before the rockslide. The onslaught erupts, burying the listener in a lung-collapsing surge of saxophone wails, trumpet squeals and double-bass throttling. The moment ends as soon as it began, dispersing into Brown's maniacally inspired building-block clatter. If the ascendant free jazz of the 1960's came to be known as ""Fire Music,"" the elemental force here takes place somewhere between metamorphic earth and storm-strewn air, though the electrical fury can hardly be traced back along its silicate tangents to any original resting place. But don't assume that the entire album is impenetrable noise. A few short interludes separate the longer works, giving single musicians the chance to test their mettle against the compositions. On ""Cross,"" I felt transported to a swirling fantasia, sure that the background was tampering with Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" until I realized that this was just Mat Maneri in the foreground on acoustic and electric viola. ""Salt"" is a comparatively straightforward number, launched by Brown and William Parker's hard-bop rhythm and spiced by Shipp's Monk-like vamping. But the final track, ""Coda,"" returns to the spatial acoustics of the first. Coxon and Wales pull the buzzing chimes of their earliest work off the lathe, causing the trumpet-like microtonality of Maneri's viola to recede into the background. Masses compresses so many components: improv artists from New York jam with Londoners and other Europeans, organic instruments collide with digital spree, free jazz is tempered by prerecorded loops. Curated by Matthew Shipp and sequenced by the Spring Heel boys, this is steaming hot fusion, a record whose density and emotional nuance requires repeated listening to decipher. Many questions are raised, but the one that tugs most anxiously in my mind is whether Coxon and Wales will attempt improvisational electronics themselves on future projects.","Spring Heel Jack entered the electronica scene in the mid-90's, clearly on the living-room listening side of the drum-n-bass ...

As part of a court-ordered apology for unleashing Fatboy Slim on an unsuspecting universe, the Astralwerks label has undertaken the incredibly noble task of re-releasing the first three albums by the legendary Düsseldorf duo Neu. The albums are to be played round the clock at Astralwerks HQ; the cheap Crayon graphics of the compact disc are to be pinned on shirts like scarlet letters; all employees are to dance the Robot at all times. We need to praise Neu like we should. As far back as I can remember, the first three Neu albums languished in the Import-only Impossible; the Japanese letters on the sleeves were incomprehensible, but also painfully explicit: prohibitively expensive, they screamed. And now, their stateside release has opened up unimagined worlds to the ears, cheap! And like the band's moniker promises, this music is new. Strange and visionary, but so incredibly familiar. Why? Because a record originally cut in 1972 by a splinter off the indomitable Kraftwerk has seeped into the musical consciousness of a generation; its influence is everywhere. Listening to Neu recalls that giddy, pointless thrill of standing at the Four Corners in the southwestern United States. What's the big deal? Well, nothing, really, except maybe the sense of being in many places at once. That's Neu: standing with cocked German eyebrows at the nexus of shimmering space rock, processed psychedelia, mechanical kraut, and wonderfully libidinal disco. Upon hearing ""Hallo Gallo,"" the first track on Neu, a friend of mine started inadvertently humming an organ line from Tortoise's ""Djed."" That quiet gesture summed up the album for me: listening to the past and hearing so much of the future. But Neu is no mere missing link. ""Hallo Gallo"" is a masterpiece of rhythm: tight drums, funky guitar scratch, a coolly insistent bassline, futuro synths, and effects-laden guitar slinging wide acid-fried launches into deep space. Neu is remarkably economical where its influences cultivate excess: the exploratory guitar and keyboards discover new aural landscapes where the pioneers of prog would remain hours blissfully adrift. ""Hallo Gallo"" is intelligent dance music in every sense of the term: it's the ass inviting the mind out onto the floor. Nobody leads; both are simply in motion. ""Sonderangebot"" is a murky soup of noise and silence: an interlude of clanging cymbals, and ambient fuzz, a kind of breathing nebula. The song bleeds darkly into ""Weißensee,"" a droning parade of dirty, cone-filtered guitar that anticipates the pastoral psychedelia of Flying Saucer Attack and Hochenkeit. ""Negativland"" opens in jackhammer drills and coalesces into a lock-tight, bass-driven martial progression of stabbing guitar and industrial noise: it's dark but strangely danceable. Something like krautpunk: syncopation, cerebral and serrated. Neu is music with the proper documentation: it passes from one musical realm to another without the jackbooted border patrol so much as blinking an eye: this is sound with the highest level security clearance. And when it shifts from one sound to the next, it never winks at you with postmodern irony, never elbows you in the ribs to let you in on the joke. Neu is truly a citizen of the musical universe, at home everywhere and everywhere at once. And Astralwerks' re-release of this phenomenal debut could only serve as a long overdue recognition of this fact. For perhaps without Neu, there would have been no Astralwerks; worse, without Neu there may have been no Pitchfork. Neu anticipates us all. Now who's your daddy? Come on, say it!","Now is the time on Pitchfork when we dance! As part of a court-ordered\n\ apology for unleashing Fatboy Slim ...

The year is 1973, and again the dynamic duo is holed up in a studio with Can/Kraftwerk producer Conrad Plank to record their sophomore effort. Neu 2 stands primarily on the strength of its eleven-minute lead-in track, ""Für Immer."" The song is pounding and serpentine, its straight-ahead rhythms approaching punk, while guitars buzz like helicopters overhead. As Plank twists the knobs, the drums take on a thin, mechanical quality. The guitars are banished to the background, only to be inverted again with renewed force. Washed-out feedback drones in and out, while the bass plods on with undeterred aggression. ""Spitzenqualitat"" is equally confrontational, dominated by hard, reverberating drums pounding at various tempos somewhere in the deep space of whispering guitar effects. The track proceeds as if Plank somehow turned up the gravity in the studio: the percussion becomes slower and heavier, as the guitars grow emptier. ""Spitzenqualitat"" simply falls apart as if it can't be sustained; the silence is too dense. ""Gedenkminute"" is nothing but the sound of that dissipation; something of a throwaway, it consists of nothing but wind and the occasional clock chime. ""Lila Engel"" is truly krautpunk, featuring Dinger's nonsensical chant: a cross between Damo Suzuki and Johnny Rotten. It's dour but explosive, channeling Neu's fierce repetition into something anthemic. Then something happens. In the Nintendo world, the sound of tinkling electronic music suddenly running at double-time can only signal one thing: you are running out of time. But in the real world, it means something else entirely: you are running out of money. I guess it's to their credit that our insolvent heroes didn't simply pad out the remainder of Neu 2 with a giant sucking sound, or the minimalist ambient textures of Rother and Dinger turning out their pocket linings. Instead, they proceeded by inventing the modern remix. ""Neusachanee 78,"" ""Super 76"" and ""Super 78"" are surgically deformed versions of the album's two singles, ""Neuschnee"" and ""Super."" Fragmented, spliced, and filled with background noise and studio chatter, these tracks lay bare the process of studio production. Likewise, the tapes in ""Hallo Ecentrico!"" rewind, fast-forward, and are eaten up by the machine. An inventive way to compensate for lack of funds, and even an ingeniously subversive commentary on music-making, these broke-ass experiments don't satisfy like the original tracks. Thankfully, the budget allowed for the album's superb closer, ""Super,"" a heavy, yet fluid assault of pounding drums and rubbery bass, complete with Dinger's savage howls; ""Super"" may just be the Boredoms' long lost uncle. And so, with an album, half-brilliant, half-ludicrous, in their hands, our heroes go out to face a cold world armed to the teeth with ""You so poor..."" jokes. Will they redeem themselves before God, country and indie posterity? Will their albums ever see U.S. release? Will East and West Germany ever be reunited, and if so, will Roger Waters make good on his promise to stage The Wall live in Berlin? Will Pink Floyd even record The Wall? Stay tuned, true believers.","When last we left our D\xFCsseldorfer heroes, Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger,\n\ they had left Kraftwerk, overcome their ...

Neu! '75,Neu!,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d413d197565213bdfd/1:1/w_160/05f7b470.gif,2001-06-05 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5756-neu-75/,Astralwerks,"And so we reach endgame. Sure, the Düsseldorf duo of Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother would release subsequent material after Neu! '75: a handful of compilations, one live album, and the fruits of the duo's half-hearted mid-80's studio reunion (both of the latter two releases being bitterly contested by Rother). But there can be little doubt that Neu! '75 serves as the group's final statement. So what happens when the new starts to grow old, when a band whose very name was an exclamation of novelty, begins to age? It's a curious fold of thought: a visionary band in the process of maturation, but an old band that has become new to us. Perhaps Neu never grew old; perhaps the world simply got wise to their sound. By 1975, Kraftwerk-- the group that spawned them-- had released Autobahn and gained international pop celebrity; Can had already mastered the music of propulsive ambience on Future Days; Faust had recorded the track that would give the entire genre its name; and punk was fomenting in the dives of England and America. 1975 was the year of Eno's Another Green World, and the year David Bowie began departing from his plastic soul phase in search of a synthetic futurism. Neu had been in hibernation for three years since the budget crisis-turned-serendipity of their tweaky sophomore effort. Neu! '75 may have marked a personal reunion for Dinger and Rother, but there's little union to be heard. The record's lush ambience masks a primal tension at the heart, as if Neu were unsure to whom they would be leaving their legacy: new age or punk. ""Isi"" is propelled by Dinger's signature ""motorik"" percussion, but where we expect Rother's deft, industrialized guitar, we hear undulating synths and piano lines expanding out in concentric circles. It's not an engine; it's an ocean. The somber ""See Land"" is a similarly organic affair, drawing more on the ""kosmische"" sound of Ash Ra Tempel and Rother's own Harmonia project (with Roedelius and Moebius of Cluster) than the factory aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Faust. Dinger's sparse, syncopated rhythm treads lightly beneath the bright, processed lines of Rother's singing guitar. Unfortunately, ""See Land"" operates by sheer repetition, a strategy employed to dazzling effect in the robotics of their earlier albums, but suggestive here of a fundamental aimlessness. The track dies on a volume fade-out, simply because there was no tension to resolve. Just drift. You must reconstruct Neu! '75 in its original incarnation as vinyl in order to fully appreciate the bruising finality with which ""Leb Wohl"" would have concluded the first side. If the first two tracks were somewhat ambivalent about the preference for ambience over trajectory, ""Leb Wohl"" resolves all doubts. Over nine minutes, the track blends plaintive piano, metronomic percussion, distant organ, and tidal washes beneath Dinger's almost-spoken vocals. One can think of Talk Talk's artful deployment of silence as a reference point. There are even moments in the glacial emptiness of ""Leb Wohl"" when one half-expects the advent of a Nordic she-male crooning heavenly in a made-up language. And just when you've resigned yourself to this new ethereal Neu, the industro-punk ""Hero"" snarls in with all the dirt and blues of the early Stones. Dinger growls out indecipherables somewhere between Jagger and Rotten, while Rother's burning guitar is finally emancipated from the benign oppression of the synths. It's the motorik of the world on the verge of a fuel crisis. That insurgency is sustained throughout the lengthy ""E-Musik,"" driven by the alien percussion of drums run through a phase shifter. The guitar skitters like pure electricity, while exploratory synths assume their proper place on the horizon. ""E-Musik"" has perfected the equation: the acid-fried expanse of their debut distilled through the radical proto-punk of their second album, and punctuated by spells of dreamy ambience. All that remains is the primal shove of ""After Eight,"" perhaps the grittiest and meanest sounding track the duo ever put its name on. Instead of a victory lap, Neu throttled into overdrive. And finally, breakdown. The world was catching up just as the engine blew out. And there wouldn't be another chance for Neu to show that they were still ten steps ahead of everybody else. The world was getting wise to their sound. So would you have been surprised then when the phone rang just a year after this record was released? Seems David Bowie had been swapping the band's LPs with Eno lately. He phoned up Rother, mentioned something about Berlin, a new sound, some project with Eno, and hey, maybe you'd like to sit in? The project, of course, would be Low. And Rother declined.","And so we reach endgame. Sure, the D\xFCsseldorf duo of Klaus Dinger and Michael\n\ Rother would release subsequent ...

The Dream of a Modern Day,Mahogany,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3705e6ef9596932382f/1:1/w_160/e5047627.gif,2001-06-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5046-the-dream-of-a-modern-day/,DarlaDarla,"Who names a genre ""shoegazer""? History tells us that some British journalist coined the phrase because the genre's early bands were more inclined to stare at the floor than to make eye contact with the audience. This was likely caused equally by years of torment from their schoolmates and the insane amounts of heroin they were on. Of course, that's just how it used to be done. These days, shoegazers are more likely just entranced by the rad bowling shoes they rescued from a thrift-store bargain bin. But really, who names a genre ""shoegazer""? Now in its 16th year (it's widely agreed that the shoegazing big bang occurred with the Jesus and Mary Chain's 1985 debut, Psychocandy), the genre's undergone some intense facial reconstruction. The self-pitying gloom has been switched with sunshine, the sunglasses-at-night were exchanged for love, and the band that started it all dropped a few members and regrouped as Freeheat. Yet, like the vampires that so inspired those early bands, the alabaster face of the genre remains untouched by the ravages of time. The New York (by way of Michigan) trio Mahogany have found a common ground where old and new shoegazer fans can live together in both suicidal misery and perpetual contentedness. It's called The Dream of a Modern Day. The record blends the downcast, dreamy sounds of early Lush and the Cocteau Twins with optimistic string sections, subtle drum programming and the sunny vocals of singer/cellist Allysa Massais. Originally released on Clairecords in late 2000, the record has just been freshly reissued with the Darla label's spiky stamp of authenticity. As it should be. Mahogany are a Darla band all the way, from the whirring U of MBV guitars to band founder Andrew Prinz's dense, reverb-laden production. But where so many other xFC-shoegazer groups are content to pile layer upon layer of effects and instruments on their DATs and bask in the white-noise result, Mahogany have clearly spent hours behind the mixing board, perfecting the levels for a glimmering sheen that reflects both the dirtier elements of 80's bliss-out and Dave Fridmann's recent work with Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips. The Dream of a Modern Day begins with ""Movement I,"" a half-minute clip of a droning string quartet that's unexpectedly interrupted by the ""Copacabana""-style drum programming that opens the album's first song, the beautiful ""Chance."" Prinz's production immediately impresses as the song bursts outward, spewing ride cymbals, glowing strings, and jangly guitar. Massais' graceful, silky vocals effortlessly ricochet up and down the musical register, intoning unintelligible lyrics delivered as though they were crammed with infinite wisdom. Elsewhere, ""Soleil Radieux"" fires off rounds of complex machine-gun percussion which are absorbed by a thick velvet curtain of orchestration; the ethereal ""Vista-dome"" pairs pounding kickdrums and showering cymbals with a mournful, ghostly melody and a downpour of violins; the stark ""Red Marrow, His Sorrow"" is stripped to its rawest form, with only a shimmering, repeated guitar line and Massais whispering, ""It's the marrow deep red/ It's the soil richly black/ It's the winter sun bleak white/ Inside of your coat warm gray."" But the biggest surprise comes with the closer, ""Synchromie No. 1."" Slickly automated thumps gradually give way to crashing drums and crescendoing, kaleidoscopic symphonies while guitars submerge themselves in a drony netherworld. When the track's lush bombardment of beauty winds down, and the disc stops spinning with a final whir, the silence is somewhat unsettling. The Dream of a Modern Day would be a pretty outstanding record, even if created by the hands of seasoned studio vets. That only a small handful of EPs precede this band's debut full-length is seriously cool, and seems to promise great things for their future. If you've worn down the grooves on your old Catherine Wheel and Curve records and are looking for something more current, I point you in the direction of this fine album and suggest you become transfixed by a pair of cheap sneakers.","Who names a genre ""shoegazer""?

Amnesiac,Radiohead,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ee13d197565213874d/1:1/w_160/e75d5920.jpeg,2001-06-04 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6659-amnesiac/,Capitol,"After months of waiting, and several tentative release dates, Amnesiac finally hit store shelves last Tuesday. Since last October, we've been hearing that this album, recorded during the same sessions as last year's wildly experimental Kid A, would serve as a return to the band's mid-90's roots. Now we come to find it was all a lie. Not that it gets me down. As far as I'm concerned, Kid A is Radiohead's defining achievement. A total departure from the conventional rock formats of OK Computer and The Bends, Kid A drew from far more abstract and obscure influences than its predecessors. Whereas previous outings captured echoes of U2 and Pink Floyd, Kid A took what it could use from the Talking Heads, Can, Talk Talk, and modern-day IDM artists, and combined it with Radiohead's irrepressible originality and sparkling, alien production. Whether you liked the end result or not, the fact that they had the balls to challenge mainstream insipidness with such heroic creativity was admirable. That said, Amnesiac is about as close to The Bends as Miss Cleo is to Jamaican. And within the first ten seconds of its opening track, ""Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box,"" the band crushes that rumor like a bug in the ground. Sparse, clanging percussion evokes abandoned swingsets. Keyboards whir to sonorous life, humming resonantly. Guitars are curiously marked absent. Production-wise, the track could have nestled cozily alongside Kid A's strangest moments, yet its melody is stunningly more infectious than even that album's height of accessibility, ""Optimistic."" Amidst chattering synths and twisted metal, Thom Yorke casually insists that he's ""a reasonable man,"" and politely intones the album's most quoted lyric: ""Get off my case."" The clattering, confrontational ""Packt"" segues awkwardly into ""Pyramid Song,"" a sweeping piano-and-strings ballad, whose unusual timing is difficult to nail down until Phil Selway's live drums give perspective on the punchdrunk rhythm. Yorke croons some of his most poetic lyrics since ""No Surprises,"" inspired by passages from Herman Hesse's Siddhartha. Amidst swelling orchestration and Satie-esque piano chords, Yorke croons a dream-like scenario in which he's visited by black-eyed angels, and his past and future loves. 4/4 traditionalists will take an immediate liking to the very OK Computer-ish ""Dollars and Cents,"" whose lyrical content is strikingly similar to the anti-government, anti-corporate themes expressed on the 1997 classic. Jonny Greenwood's minimal, warped guitarwork and distant string arrangements float celestially over brother Colin's menacing basslines and Selway's delicate drumming. ""Knives Out"" is another OK Computer-style reverbathon, replete with strummed acoustics, chiming electrics, and a not-too-tasteful rehashing of a prominent guitar line from ""Paranoid Android."" Great melody. However, they've fucking used it before. The song also loses points for containing the line, ""Shove it in your mouth."" Really, Thom. Similarly disappointing is ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors."" Powered by a gritty industrial beat, the song's intentional abstractness, for the first time ever, seems forced and caricatured. Thom's MacinYorke vocal treatments never seemed terribly groundbreaking, and here, the gimmick has gone utterly limp. Yorke's lyrical content is also at its most unchallenging, as he educates us on the many varieties of doors that exist, over oafish, programmed beats worthy of a Cleopatra Records sampler. Elsewhere, ""Hunting Bears"" is a two-minute instrumental clip of aimless guitar noodling that shoots for Neil Young's Dead Man soundtrack but comes off as a cutrate Wish You Were Here outtake. A track like this is meant to segue into a related piece of music; instead, we're flung headfirst into the completely dissimilar ""Like Spinning Plates."" If nothing else, Radiohead have always realized the emotional impact of a stunning album closer, and Amnesiac offers two. Sitting side by side, ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""Life in a Glasshouse"" are so vastly superior to the album's other tracks that the album's few misteps are easily forgiven. ""Spinning Plates,"" while a much better fit for Kid A, is nonetheless one of Radiohead's most affecting tracks to date. It opens with a digitally simulated ""spinning"" sound, disorienting reversed keyboard, and subtle keyboard pings. The song hits its peak when Yorke's indecipherable backwards vocals unexpectedly revert to traditional forward singing during the mournful climax, ""And this just feels like/ Spinning plates/ My body's floating down a muddy river."" But if ""Like Spinning Plates"" would have been a fitting apex for Kid A, ""Life in a Glasshouse"" is entirely suited to the eclectic Amnesiac. Rather than creating a unique, Frankensteinian amalgamation from fragments of other genres, Radiohead instead target a style of music that hasn't been touched for decades: Edison-era big band. In the process of adapting the archaic jazz sound to polyrhythmic piano chords and rock lyricism, Radiohead touch upon an incredibly unique sound that could potentially inspire an entirely new genre. ""Glasshouse"" is most easily (and most often) likened to a New Orleans funeral dirge-- probably because it's not far off the mark. Largely inspired by Louis Armstrong's ""St James Infirmary,"" this track is the least like the others on Amnesiac, and easily the record's winning moment. When, amidst rueful trombone, tumbling clarinet, and the crushingly emotive trumpet of longtime BBC session musician Humphrey Lyttelton, Yorke insists, ""Of course I'd like to sit around and chat/ Of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat,"" and follows it with a minute of wailing ""only, only, only... there's someone listening in,"" the intensity is indescribable. Despite the heights attained by much of Amnesiac, I prefer Kid A for a number of reasons. Quality aside, the questionable sequencing of Amnesiac does little to hush the argument that the record is merely a thinly veiled b-sides compilation; Kid A played out as a cohesive whole that evoked panic and paranoia as well as surrealism and disorientation. Still, Amnesiac's highlights were undeniably worth the wait, and easily overcome its occasional patchiness. Now if you'll pardon me, I have to go untie DiCrescenzo.","After months of waiting, and several tentative release dates, Amnesiac finally hit store shelves last Tuesday. Since last October, we ...

All the Suits Began to Fall Off EP,Mercury Program,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4355e6ef959693239e3/1:1/w_160/56f0b602.gif,2001-05-31 05:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5232-all-the-suits-began-to-fall-off-ep/,Tiger Style,"Well, the Program is getting better. This ought to be cause for celebration no matter which of two categories you fall into. I'm referring, of course, to the divisive effect of last year's The Vapor of Gasoline and how it split people into opposing camps of a) hypester idolaters that overstepped their enthusiasm for the album into the sphere of gross exaggeration, and b) the backlash contingent that turned their collective nose up at the young, unproven band. If you hail from the former grouping you'll find your feelings well justified; if you weren't fully convinced last time around, All the Suits Began to Fall Off could, and should, do the trick. Being from the culturally backward, asphyxiatingly humid peninsula that is our not-so-great state of Florida, I have a soft spot for anything out of America's Wang that doesn't outright blow. Making it out of there unsullied by the dense fog of suckitude that hangs over everything is a victory in and of itself. The general adversarial ambience is not unlike the dry-ice, death-angel mist effect from Charlton Heston's The Ten Commandments, only Florida is much too humorless and unimaginative a place to host a pharaoh. Whether by divine decree or oversight, the suck managed to pass over this Gainsevillean quartet, and though that's a pretty low bar, the Mercury Program takes it as a mere starting point, vastly surpassing expectations. People are sort of funny about their music. You've no doubt heard somebody lament, with corny solemnity, that the guitar/bass/drums paradigm that has served us so well for so long has finally utterly exhausted its potential-- the implication being that it's high time we abandon it. Stick around a while and you may hear the same person tear down a new group for relying on so-called ""gimmicky"" instrumentation. Only here, the unspoken, and perhaps accidental implication is that any rock musician that dares step outside the inviolate magic circle of guitar/bass/drums must be innovating for innovation's sake, and probably to compensate for some lack. Because, if you can't do it with the time-tested ingredients, maybe you shouldn't be doing it at all. Right, like I said, people are funny about their music. The Mercury Program is just one of those groups that ""rely"" on non-traditional instrumentation. They incorporate vibraphone, and on this release, employ a fair number of Rhodes-ish keyboard parts as integral elements. Far from gimmicky, the vibe lines add a chilly, ethereal stratum to the layers of mutating guitar phrases and the tight rhythm section. Since ""vibraphone"" is one of the first words you hear in a description of their sound, the effect of its presence is worth exploring. Rather than characterizing it as an added layer, it's more accurate to say that the vibraphone, by virtue of its timbre, actually illuminates the stratified nature of the music. Its coolly reverberant sound contrasts as sharply with the alternately raspy and silky guitar parts as it does with the foundation of bass and drums, appearing to exist both between and outside those sounds. A crisp separation of sound is the result, as well an appearance of space and distance in what might otherwise have been a much muddier mix. It's the auditory equivalent of taking all the objects in a cluttered room and boxing them into individual cubes of limpid glass. Apart from its beautiful melodic and harmonic role, the vibraphone performs this all-important function, at once complimenting the ensemble, and demarcating the other instruments both from itself and from each other. But who are these guys? Well, for starters, they're multi-instrumentalists. Tom Reno, erstwhile sometimes-singer on previous releases, limits himself here to guitar, bass, and bells. Big brother Sander Travisano likewise holds down guitar and bass and makes occasional forays into drumming, while little brother Whit Travisano feels it on electric piano and the vibes. Dave Lebleu, principal drummer, is responsible for the busy-bee percussion that sounds sort of like a jazzier, more vocal take on DC-style drumming. The collective sound is very much groove-oriented at the bottom, but given to loopy, spinning guitar bits, and Philip Glass-ish melodic abstraction on the vibraphone and keyboard. At half an hour, this five-song teaser packs quite a value. There are no weak tracks to be found, and the repeat appearance of producer Andy Baker (Japancakes, Macha, the Causey Way) does the band's intricacies justice. The guitar playing this time around is less aggressive, with virtually none of the satisfyingly dissonant chord bursts from Vapor. That's not to say it's better or worse, but simply that they've taken a different direction this time, where more often than not, the guitar and vibe parts don't play off each other so much as attempt to intertwine and form a sonic fabric. I'd like to see them bring back some of that caustic guitar playing, though; it provided a focal point amidst the wash of harmonic atmospherics. That, however, is just a matter of taste. The point: All the Suits Began to Fall Off indicates a bright and interesting future for the group. Go Florida.","Well, the Program is getting better.

Calculating Components and Compound Formulas for Mass Population Reconstruction,Anasazi,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0909d034d5c69bf2754/1:1/w_160/fa4c0a88.gif,2001-05-31 05:00:06,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/177-calculating-components-and-compound-formulas-for-mass-population-reconstruction/,Troubleman Unlimited,"I went $10,000 into the red and defaulted twice on my student loans for my anthropology degree, so I sure as shit am going to begin this review by pointing out the obvious significance of this band's name. The Anasazi were the ancient forebears of the Native American Pueblo people, who dwelt in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. The Anasazi, or ""Ancient Ones"" as they were known in the Navajo tongue, famously disappeared 700 years ago, leaving behind cryptic ruins, scattered evidence of sophistication in astronomy and pottery, and one of the most challenging archaeological puzzles in North America. No one knows where they came from or where they went. There. But what does that have to do with the band? Admittedly, not much. We know where the hardcore quartet came from: they sprung fully armed and armored from the foreheads of seminal Santa Cruz cult hardcore bands Mohinder and Jenny Piccolo. Likewise, we can guess where they're going: one LP, a couple split seven-inches, and then scattered to the winds like spores of fungi to form other like-minded bands. But let's stick to the present. The Anasazi are as unforgivable as they are unforgiving. Sonically, Measurement and Control is a terrible mythological beast. The sound is that of the deep, sonorous larynx of a Cthulhu-ish monster steeped in bile and vitriol. A guttural excretion. It almost dares to walk the line of the unlistenable. All the trappings of deep hardcore are present: tinny drums perched atop the mix, a treble wash, submerged vocals, and enough makeshift, vicious distortion to wipe out a civilization are blendered with lethal centrifugal force. The result is a murky mess. Where it aims for the bottled fury of Jenny Piccolo, it sails wide right. When it reaches for the smarter, more original work of Mohinder, it falls short, dying by the hand of its own ambition. The titles are wonderfully vivid: ""Getting One's Message from His Formaldehyde and Autistic Animal Pieces,"" ""Premeditated Amphetamine Killing Spree,"" and ""Holy Crusade Against the Godless Forces of Intercellular Communism."" However, the Anasazi clearly shot their creative wad coming up with these elephantine names, because the music itself remains uniformly and consistently bland, unfeeling, rote hardcore. The lyrics, meanwhile, are blunt and literal throughout: ""At war with bureaucrats/ This land is our land/ Crush their buildings/ Torch their homes/ Burn their money/ We die for them no longer/ Kill 'em all."" And then there's the more economical, ""Sleep/ Eat/ Work/ Drone/ Life bled dry."" Those are complete songs, by the way. Measurement and Control opens with an eerie pump-organ feedback effect on ""Xenophobic Dictators Commense [sic] the Hidden Agenda to Eradicate the Purveyors of the Holy Church."" The song crescendos before purposefully imploding under its own awkward, bulky weight. The music halts abruptly to showcase bumped pickups, half-strummed chords, and other studio found-noise that sort of forms a segue into the next track. The record almost finds its gimpy stride halfway through when the songs begin to congeal somewhat more effectively. ""Mosquitoing Vector Control"" displays the pest-like buzzing of its titular namesake. The band plays tighter on this song than anywhere else on the album, and to a certain degree, the musicianship carries through the frequent tempo and stylistic changes of the following two tracks. The disc ends with the tightly wound, more traditional-sounding hardcore burst, ""Fortress."" However, these apparent improvements are only relative to the earlier failures. Measured against their own forebears, as well as their contemporaries, the Anasazi leave a lot to be desired for the discerning hardcore fan. Some of the best moments on Measurements and Control lie in the brief garnishes that preface half the songs. Kitschy and playful, they range from a space-synth nod or two to a snatch of newscast lead-in music. But these are neither intended to be taken seriously nor developed beyond the short, diversionary preamble. Measurement and Control is an aural plague of biblical proportions, imagery that would no doubt suit the Anasazi just fine, with all the dermatological festering-- blisters, boils, lesions, running sores-- they personify through their music. It's about as enjoyable as a pus-oozing, gangrenous wound.",,2.6,
Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse,Of Montreal,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a713d197565213aeda/1:1/w_160/f8c75f42.gif,2001-05-31 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5952-coquelicot-asleep-in-the-poppies-a-variety-of-whimsical-verse/,Kindercore,"Will you hold me? I'm scared. It's not that I'm easily frightened. I can sit through the most gruesome horror movie, happily munching away on imitation butter-flavored popcorn while small intestines are strewn about the screen. I can watch news stories about mad cow disease while devouring sheep's brain soufflé. But listening to the latest Of Montreal record, all I can do is curl up in a ball, smile the sick, twisted smile of the damned, and nod my head up and down in a rhythmic fashion. If you're familiar with the work of Athens popsters Of Montreal, the disconcerting mix of a feeling of imminent implosion and a nagging urge to draw pictures of smiling bunny rabbits I'm experiencing at the moment probably doesn't surprise you. Of Montreal's music, and the bizarre artwork that accompanies it, plays like a surreal carnival-- it can be beautiful, it can be fun, and it can also be weird and creepy. Coquelicot, like most Of Montreal albums, is at times sublime and lovely, at times infuriatingly catchy, at times simply infuriating, at times overly twee, and at times seriously fucking scary. What sets this record apart from its predecessors, though, is a level of intricacy and detail that Of Montreal have never previously attained as a band. The songs on Coquelicot, though crammed full of saccharine pop hooks, display a level of complex structuring and arrangement that could put most pop records to shame. Of Montreal's trademark hyperactivity, and melodic yet off-kilter sensibility is possibly at its peak on Coquelicot. Seemingly drawing as much from the English music hall tradition as from American pop acts like the Beach Boys, there's nothing else out there quite like the frenetic, utterly wacked-out pop these guys come up with. When the record's at its best, the group incorporates more diverse elements into their music than ever before. ""Good Morning Mr. Edminton,"" Coquelicot's opener, is a typical Of Montreal song in prime form. Fuzzed-out guitar, bouncy piano, and multitracked harmonies by frontman Kevin Barnes set the stage for a demented tale of kidnapping and working class struggle as told, of course, from the kidnapper's point of view. ""The Peacock Parasols,"" which features a truly unforgettable, cryptic, and quite possibly misspelled lyric referring to ""P.P. icycles,"" goes from a pop song in warp drive to a dense, orchestral middle, and back. Though fast-paced pop is clearly the bread and butter of Coquelicot, it's far from the only style to be found on this record. They're not playing around about the ""variety of whimsical verse"" thing. And sadly, this means the inclusion of the intolerable skit ""The Events Leading Up to the Collapse of Detective Dulllight,"" in which Kevin Barnes seeks to shatter your preconceived notions of reality by introducing a character whose name contains three consecutive ""l's."" After a series of good songs, nothing's quite as frustrating as hitting a 2\xBD comedy routine in which some guy named Slocks writes a poem called ""The Cause of Gauze."" And then reads it aloud. Besides annoying passages like these, the album's most challenging element is its length. At a solid 70 minutes, it's almost impossible to endure an entire sitting. Had the filler been cut, this would easily be their best album yet, but repeated exposure to this stuff for that length of time can't be good for anybody.

Gorillaz,Gorillaz,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf745e6ef959693233d6/1:1/w_160/7a1f7e38.jpg,2001-05-31 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3524-gorillaz/,Virgin,"Somewhere in England, or maybe Iceland, Graham Coxon is crying. Blur recently announced that their hiatus will continue through the year's end, due to Damon Albarn's collaboration with Norman Cook. To make matter worse, another Albarn side project, Gorillaz, has already hit stores on both sides of the Atlantic. The novelty group finds Albarn assuming the role of 2-D, the animated lead singer of a pack of four misfits, whose likeness was envisioned by Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett. The Automator-produced ""act"" is a smarmy, promotional gimmick. And it's the best Blur offshoot released to date. As soon as the record begins, the cartoon façade fades. Even people who only know Blur as ""that band who did 'Woo-Hoo'"" will immediately detect Albarn's ever-so-Brit pipes. Early reports suggested that Albarn contributed to only a few songs, but he could rightfully be called the band's frontman; his croon can be heard on all but 4 of the album's 16 tracks. Dan ""The Automator"" Nakamura is similarly recognizable. There's no band (animated or otherwise) making this music; it's the Automator throwing down beats, manipulating samples, and letting Kid Koala's scratches interrupt his flow. And that, friends, is why Gorillaz is a conceptual failure. But maybe this is for the best. Nakamura's refreshing production doesn't rely on today's hip-hop skitters and squiggles for its futurism. No, what we've got here is the same brooding backpacker hip-hop that elevated the similar Deltron 3030 LP to unforeseen heights. As a result, this record reveals itself as far less disposable than its cartoon cover art suggests. Gorillaz's best tracks exploit the unlikely, but successful dynamic between Albarn and Nakamura. On ""Man Research (Clapper)"", Damon wails hysterically over Dan's relentless, echoing thump. ""New Genious (Brother)"" is gloomy trip-hop with orchestral flourishes that wrap around the flux of Albarn's falsetto. On ""Clint Eastwood"", Del tha Funkee Homosapien handles the song's verses, allowing Damon a small cameo in the looped chorus. And curiously, I can think of few other samples that would compliment Del's urgent delivery as effectively as Albarn's laconic vocal haze. The album's foray into dub-lite, ""Slow Country"", is Gorillaz's charming peak. A light, Latin-tinged piano playfully slides over a sunny groove while Albarn exhibits ""Tender""-like plaintiveness with lines like, ""I can't stand your loneliness."" Despite the fact that this track is unfamiliar territory for both Nakamura and Albarn, their charismatic playfulness makes for undeniable fun. The small-scale experimentation, though, falls flat on the record's few rock tracks. The appropriately titled ""Re-Hash"" is such a generic marriage of acoustic pop and stock hip-hop beats that, were Albarn to come in chanting, ""Come, m'lady, come, come m'lady,"" it would hardly strike as surprising. The Wire reject, ""Punk"", suffers from an asinine formula (play a sloppy riff, clap three times, add cockney vocals, repeat) that makes each of the track's 90 seconds harrowing. That Gorillaz's closing number-- Ed Case's two-step-meets-raga remix of ""Clint Eastwood""-- doesn't feel out of place could be taken as testament to how successfully eclectic the album is. But in actuality, it's a sign of the record's short-lasting, faddish appeal. Gorillaz is the definitive side-project: Even at its best, it's never more than a divergent one-off stint. Albarn may occasionally succeed on non-Blur outings, but as with Coxon and Alex James' solo affairs, they only further prove that Blur is equal to much more than the sum of its parts. Keep ya head up, Graham.","Somewhere in England, or maybe Iceland, Graham Coxon is crying. Blur recently\n\ announced that their hiatus will continue through ...

More Revery EP,Bonny Billy,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a29d034d5c69bf2c46/1:1/w_160/176510a6.gif,2001-05-31 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/697-more-revery-ep/,Temporary Residence,"He's a little bit country. He's a little bit rock and roll. He's admired by the likes of Björk and PJ Harvey. He sings songs about love, mountains, and incest. He's released a gazillion albums, EPs, and singles under almost as many pseudonyms and for almost as many labels. He's toured the world with cool people like David Pajo in his backing band. He's made guest appearances on records by the likes of semi-fossilized country icon Johnny Cash. Yes, indeed, Will Oldham is a busy man. So busy, in fact, that it's hard to imagine him having a lot of time to just kick back, relax, and spin a few of his favorite CDs. But it makes sense that someone with such a keen grasp of just how powerful music can be would spend a good deal of his time picking up on the music of others. And with this appropriately-titled EP, Will finally gives what we can only assume are those who inspired him the credit they deserve. More Revery, originally released as a super-limited-edition tour-only EP in Temporary Residence's Travels in Constants series, consists of six cover songs, including new Oldham-riffic versions of tunes by Bill Withers and Tim McGraw. Yes, that Tim McGraw. But the beauty of the Oldham machine is that, no matter what goes in, the song that comes out winds up sounding not just like one of Will's own songs, but like one of Will's better songs. A pleasant cover of Mamas and Papas founder John Phillips' brief, folky ""Someone's Sleeping"" opens More Revery with beautiful near-perfection. Oldham puts his mark on the song within seconds, his unmistakable, quavering voice intoning above sloppily-played piano, guitar, and sparse drums. Even though it's foreign material, it's one of the most gorgeous songs Oldham has recorded recently, and seems to fit his style as well, if not better than most of the songs on his current full-length, Ease Down the Road. While ""Someone's Sleeping"" seems like perfect fodder for an Oldham cover, PJ Harvey's dark, droning ""Sweeter than Anything"" presents a greater challenge. The fact that the version on More Revery seems to work so seamlessly as a Will Oldham song speaks to Oldham's willingness to recast the songs he's interpreting in his own image. ""Sweeter than Anything"" is almost completely transformed, as it seems that Oldham is more interested in being true to himself than being true to the song, replacing Harvey's quiet, barely-contained intensity with his own wailing, foot-tapping brand of haunting Appalachian passion. Similarly passionate is a blazing cover of ""Lean on Me"" singer Bill Withers' ""Same Love That Made Me Laugh."" When Oldham sings, ""If you don't want me, I don't want to live,"" his delivery is utterly convincing-- borrowed words have rarely sounded this sincere. As for the cover of Tim McGraw's mass-produced crap country hit, ""Just to See You Smile,"" Oldham seems to accomplish the impossible, turning a McNugget into a home-cooked chicken meal with all the trimmings. Minus the glossy production and sterile vocals, ""Just to See You Smile"" isn't all that bad, though the lyrics remain admittedly cheesy. I doubt that Will Oldham is Tim McGraw's biggest fan, but he's done the song a great deal of credit by giving it what is certainly the best cover it will ever receive. Too bad Tim will probably never hear it. Sadly, More Revery does have one weak link: an awkward, reverb-drenched cover of Jamaican singer John Holt's ""Strange Things."" Only here does Oldham seem to lose a firm grasp over the source material, applying layers of unnecessary vocal effects, and in doing so making his creaky voice sound annoyingly inhuman. Although it culls material from a diverse group of artists, More Revery owes its ultimate success to the fact that it sounds like Will Oldham. Very few musicians are as capable of handling their own work as well as Oldham does, let alone six very different songs by six very different songwriters. He's covered Tim McGraw. He's covered AC/DC. Where will the future take him? Let's hope he follows the only logical next step: a strummed acoustic guitar and organ version of ""Big Pimpin'.""",,8.0,
The Smith Album,Kleenexgirlwonder,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd5eb335119a49ecb1d/1:1/w_160/bc472368.gif,2001-05-31 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4488-the-smith-album/,MOC,"Once upon a time, Graham Smith was a very happy man. At the tender age of 19, his Ponyoak album was garnering rave reviews from music critics worldwide and earning him a solid fanbase with its combination of anthemic pop hooks, clever lovelorn lyrics, and lo-fi recording charms. Graham went to Japan, where he became very popular, with throngs of underage pointy-featured Japanese girls throwing themselves at him. Graham was very happy, indeed. But one thing still nagged him: while he was never hesitant to give himself full credit-- naming an album Graham Smith is the Coolest Person Alive, and naming himself alone in the thank yous of Ponyoak-- there was one member of his band that he had yet to give the slightest credit to. This vital entity had not only recorded all of Ponyoak, it was also responsible for sequencing, arranging, and countless other essential tasks. Graham Smith had never thanked his computer. Though his computer couldn't express its resentment directly, Smith could tell it wasn't pleased. The Cakewalk software he'd been using to record began causing general protection faults to the point of inoperability. Smith tried to appease the beast by thanking it regularly for its kind work, installing a shiny new DVD drive, and even spending five hours on the phone with Microsoft tech support, who told him that, to appease the temperamental bugs in Windows '98, the software would require a major software update and ""the sacrifice of two virgins, pure and true."" Sadly, Smith was without a fast Internet connection, and all his friends were skanks. But he got the feeling that even obeying the orders of the Microsoft tech support guys would not quell the violent machine. From weeks of careful observation, Smith had finally decided what the computer wanted. Like any dejected-feeling band member, it just wanted to sing. At first, Smith was a bit unsure. It was, after all, his shaky, crackly vocal delivery that had helped make Ponyoak such a success; he just couldn't imagine a computer taking on the intensely human emotions he depicted in his songs. And suddenly, a lightbulb went off in Smith's mind: ""I know,"" he said. ""I'll record some songs about love and stuff that I'll sing. Then I'll mix them into a trite, fucked-up, occasionally funny but generally dull plot that somehow involves a computer. What's more, I'll make the computer say funny things. Like 'fuck' and 'cocaine.' Fourth grade was fun."" And so, Smith set about to record The Smith Album, a two-disc set that he hoped would set things straight between himself and his computer. Sure enough, the computer worked without a hitch. But in the time it took Smith to conceptualize The Smith Album, he'd forgotten to write the actual songs for the record! Fearing that the public would probably not respond well to an album that came off like a twisted hybrid of RZA's Bobby Digital and an Adam Sandler record, Smith sat down and wrote a bunch of mid-tempo, largely acoustic songs to flesh out The Smith Album. While some of the finished songs, like the hook-propelled ""Reunited Airlines,"" made Smith genuinely proud, he couldn't help but feel that the rest of the songs, which broke down mostly into either goofy, upbeat pop numbers or mellow folky acoustic tracks, just didn't live up to the widely varied songwriting he demonstrated on Ponyoak. And his attempts to augment the album's sound with a plethora of synthesized sounds did little but cover up the weaknesses that once developed in his songwriting. His computer was happy, though, and he'd been promising his fans a follow-up to Ponyoak for what seemed like ages. Feeling pressure from man and machine alike, Smith released the album to his eager fans, and hoped for the best. Well, this eager fan is not pleased. Despite clocking in at a bloated 87:47, The Smith Album contains fewer actual songs than Ponyoak and nearly none of the inspiration. What's more, the skits surrounding these songs just make them seem even weaker-- after a while, the egregious amount of filler on The Smith Album leaves you simply not giving a shit, and causes many of the songs that would otherwise seem heartfelt and sincere to just fade into ambiguity. But there are moments of sharp-witted humor-- an in-joke about the frequent Guided by Voices comparisons, and the presence of a female computer virus named Melissa. As the album's packaging suggests, though, The Smith Album registers more like an action flick than an album. Sure, action flicks can be good for a few cheap thrills, but when's the last time you wanted to see one twice?","Once upon a time, Graham Smith was a very happy man.

The Tyranny of Distance,Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann & Chip Chanko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd9eb335119a49ecd65/1:1/w_160/e1e60459.jpg,2001-05-31 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4738-the-tyranny-of-distance/,Lookout!,"Dear bosom friend,
Kindly trust me that it is in your best interest to go buy the new Ted Leo record. It's called The Tyranny of Distance, and it's one of the best pop albums of the year. You won't be able to stop whistling the first song. Sincerely,
Kristin Sage --- And that's all you have to say to a bosom friend. But I wanted to tell more people about this album, so I decided to write my first Pitchfork review in nine months about it. I felt out of the groove, and articulating my feelings about The Tyranny of Distance wasn't coming easily, so I played Madonna's ""Into the Groove"" for inspiration. It worked. The material girl's lifeless vocals, supported by a canned beat and slap-bass, reminded me of what was at stake. There's too much vacant, formulaic pop being pushed out of vocoders and onto the airwaves for people not to hear this record. Ted Leo's latest offers ample hooks, a uniquely expressive voice, and a perfect single that, in a just universe, would be all over the radio. I wanted to tell the world of the album's riches! Riches of song! Plus, most days I'd rather write a review than prove my love to Madonna. After Leo's impressive work with Chisel and his legendary performances with his brother Danny in the Sin Eaters, Ted Leo's solo work has been anything but consistent. It's ranged from unlistenable tape experiments to a great cover of Thin Lizzy's ""Little Girl in Bloom."" This album could have sounded like anything. As it turns out, it sounds like everything. The first few chords of ""My Vien Ilin"" instantly reminded me of the MTV theme that used to come on behind the astronaut. ""The Gold Finch and the Red Oak Tree"" uses the metaphor of a message sent through a bird's simple song, and recalls the Beatles' ""Blackbird."" The last segment of ""Stove by a Whale"" sounds like it should be played by Uilleann pipes. When I saw Ted perform with the Sin Eaters, he was decked out in a denim jacket with Rush scrawled on the back in magic marker, and the arena rock sound is certainly a common denominator in Ted's equation. Backing him here are the Pharmacists, who probably sport similar jackets with ""The Who"" and ""Wire"" marked on the sleeves. The guys seem to have gotten a kick out of passing the sticks around the studio-- the tracks featuring Danny Leo's drumming become fist pumping anthems, while James Canty's kit harkens back to Keith Moon showmanship. James' brother Brendan (who produced the album and can usually be found playing in Fugazi) even lends a hand on ""The Great Communicator."" Pete Kerlin and Alex Minoff round out the line-up on bass, and Amy Dominguez from Telegraph Melts guests on cello. This could all have easily turned into a giant mess, but as Ted sings on ""Parallel or Together,"" ""So I gather around me all the pieces of a song/ And fit them where they belong."" And it really isn't any more complicated than that-- Leo might be influenced by the Jam, Wire, and Thin Lizzy, but he's got a guitar that never sounds confused, and an amazing talent to combine these elements into something that sounds distinctly Ted Leo. If I had to register a complaint, it's that ""Timorous Me"" could only be described as ""very John Cougar,"" even if the first line wasn't, ""Me and Johnny sittin' in the green grass."" It opens with dueling guitars that could take on the Allman Brothers in a bare-knuckles fight (and get the girl) before settling into lyrics that seem nostalgic and forced. But let's face it: many songs on this album are simply poignant and earnest. The fact that only one turned to cheese is a testament the record's general ability to deliver. Two of the album's lyrical themes seem to reflect the fork-in-the-road Leo's songwriting has approached: taking a step back to look at things in a simple way, and finding songs in what he hears all around him. In the past, it seemed like Leo had to actively attempt to obscure his clear vision and effortless pop songwriting in the name of experimentation or deconstruction. That's not always necessarily a bad thing, sure. But now, in ""Biomusicology,"" Ted sets the record straight: ""All the songs you hear down there/ They have a purpose/ All in all, we cannot stop singing/ We cannot start sinking.../ We swim until it ends."" Well, I can't stop whistling the damn song, so let's hope Ted keeps swimming. Maybe next time he'll leave Johnny Cougar out of it.",,8.5,
We Love the City,Hefner,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c09a13d197565213ba83/1:1/w_160/0c9c85d9.gif,2001-05-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3800-we-love-the-city/,Too Pure,"When I write my second review of the same band for Pitchfork, I typically look back at what I wrote the first time and try to see how the band has developed since their last release. Hefner's Breaking God's Heart is such a distant memory now. It's like I reviewed it in the throes of some kind of fugue state. I remember a Cockney accent singing some catchy songs, but that's about it. My own review provides few clues as to what Hefner might be all about. I made some puzzling and ultimately embarrassing remarks about Belle & Sebastian, and then I tried to shoehorn some humor in by comparing Hefner to Poison. This will not stand. Clearly, Hefner are much more in the vein of Cinderella. I think I understand now why I was at a loss for anything interesting to say about Breaking God's Heart. The music of Hefner just doesn't do much for me. And yet, because it's not really bad in any discernable way, I don't have a particularly entertaining way to attack it. So this review would be much easier to write if I just explained my own personal development and ignored Hefner. But that's not why the 'Fork pays me, so I'm going to do my best. In Hefner's favor, they subscribe to the virtues of classic pop songwriting. The chord changes line up with the melodies, which seem familiar but not overly so, and hence, are pleasant. The songs are banged out on guitars and pianos and have saxophones wailing in the background. The subject matter alternates between intimate relationships and the pros and cons of city living. The vocals often break into awkward yelling mid-song, as if singer Darren Hayman really means it (I believe he does, actually). But if it sounds like I'm describing The Commitments as an emo band, well... if the vintage boots fit... That could sound more contemptuous than I mean it to be. In truth, about half the time Hayman takes off on his pitch-challenged flights of fancy, I want to follow him. The vocal break on this record's title song is particularly inspired, as Haymen's admittedly whiny refrain of ""if you don't love me,"" which swells perfectly with the instrumental surge, resonates emotionally. But for every one of those, there's a discomforting moment, as on ""The Day That Thatcher Dies"". First, songs about Thatcher are why I ignored British rock in the 80s (my beloved Smiths excepted). Second, the riff is stolen from BTO's ""Takin' Care of Business"". And then, at the climax of the song, a child's chorus intones, ""Ding, dong, the witch is dead!"" These guys could learn something about subtlety from Hugh Hefner. Sorry, this is decent pub-rock, but there are 1,000 albums released every day. Buy another one.","When I write my second review of the same band for Pitchfork, I typically look back at what I wrote ...

Double Figure,Plaid,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09ec0084474cd0bfc03/1:1/w_160/3733a7ca.gif,2001-05-29 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6335-double-figure/,WarpWarp,"One of music's best qualities is its talent for escaping description. Critics, because we lack the vocabulary to verbally illustrate what we hear, approximate our explanations with obtuse metaphors and imprecise comparisons. As a relative greenhorn in the Pitchfork camp, I don't have much experience crafting the sort of riddles reviewers always speak in, so maybe it's time I got some practice. And where better to start than with Plaid's latest musical conundrum, Double Figure-- an album whose ostensible theme is mystery, and an album for which few words are suited? So, if you'll permit me a moment of intellectual masturbation: Plaid's first LP, Not for Threes, was to M.C. Escher as their second, Rest Proof Clockwork, was to Roy Lichtenstein. On Double Figure, intended as the final instalment of this IDM trilogy, Ed Handley and Andy Turner match the mind-bending intricacy and academic precision of Threes with the vibrant palettes and playful sensibility of Clockwork. The result is an aesthetically diverse gallery of songs that, in its finest moments, calls to mind the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky and Rene Magritte-- immediately intriguing and immaculately produced, always with a cryptic sense of inexplicable urgency. Where continuity is concerned, Double Figure reminds me of a salad made from candy bars, or a library where the books are actually ant farms-- neither of which I've actually encountered, but in literary circles, we call that poetic license. The disjointed juxtaposition of styles on this disc is so pronounced that it feels intentional; like The White Album or Jega's Spectrum, this record underscores its versatility at the expense of consistency. While all of the tracks-- even the minute-long Tak snippets-- are autonomous, ambitiously complex entities, each of the 19 songs bear the duo's unifying, idiosyncratic stamp. And the absence of tangible themes lets listeners filter the gems from the garbage (the album doles out a healthy balance of both) without losing the plot. When this album fails, it's not for want of trying. Handley and Turner seem to be pushing the envelope beyond their previous efforts, grafting more difficult harmonic arrangements onto the densely layered beat construction that characterized Not for Threes. But they often bite off more than they can chew. On ""Light Rain,"" the melodies run amok and lose cohesion, and ""Silversum"" falls prey to the detached focus on percussive structure that plagued Plaid's debut. Double Figure strikes gold, however, with songs like ""Zala,"" a frenetic melange of off-kilter string synths and atmospheric melodies, punctuated by brisk snares and cymbals. ""Eyen"" kicks the album off in the right key, building steam from a flamenco guitar sample, wistful strings and a soft, flat bassline. Elements of chaos cautiously creep in on the instrumentation, then wash out the melodies entirely. The light drum breaks and Ennio Morricone leanings touch on the sound of ""Pino Pomo"" from the pair's last album, only with a less panicked and more tranquil outlook. Plaid attempt the Funki Porcini sound with the onomatopoetically titled ""Ti Bom."" Jazzy breaks with clipped cymbal hits (bom-bom-ti-bom) keep the tempo while distorted horns flirt with airy hand drums in the song's upper registers. ""Squance"" reveals the duo's dancefloor viability with a disco-tinged drum-n-bass foray into the possibilities of stereo. Handley and Turner flaunt their range all over this record, laying on the brooding gravity of ""Sincetta"" only moments before igniting the 8-bit electro of ""Porn Coconut Co."" But Double Figure suffers from an excess of ambition, and when Plaid aim too high, they miss the mark. This album features some of their best work to date, but also some of their greatest failures. Rest Proof Clockwork may not have tried as hard, but it worked brilliantly within its limits. Double Figure takes Plaid through a tract of uncharted territory, and their ship sometimes runs aground.","One of music's best qualities is its talent for escaping description.

"10,000 Hz Legend",Air,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02a13d19756521382fc/1:1/w_160/b3c59f2e.gif,2001-05-28 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/,AstralwerksSource,"I wouldn't say she was a lost cause, but my girlfriend needed a music doctor like I needed, well, a girlfriend. That is, desperately. Call it a perfect match. She'd spent too many years clubbing to have more than a passing knowledge of non-techno music, and I'd spent too many years shucking to have more than a passing knowledge of monogamous sex. The results have been fast, effective, and largely painless. She's taken to the Pixies, and I've taken to, um, lots of sex. Air's debut, 1998's Moon Safari, is not only a pop classic of retro-futurism; it also provides a damn fine soundtrack to the otherworldly act of sex. Needless to say, we became well acquainted with the album, which both of us were already fond of to begin with. Their soundtrack to Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, 2000's The Virgin Suicides, was a similarly fluid pour of analog synths, but the album was a less pop-oriented, more minor-key affair. And if you've seen the movie, you can understand why I wouldn't want to do ""the beast with two backs"" while listening to its irrevocably-linked score. So would Air's official follow-up to Moon Safari be a return to coital form? I'll let my girlfriend do the talking: ""Weird."" That would be the opener, ""Electronic Performers."" She wasn't necessarily turned off by the deep bass thumps that rip into electronic handclaps. Or the occasional heavy rapping, like the landlord at your door a day after the rent's due. And it definitely wasn't the radar beeps or the fluctuating machinations of the keyboard. I think it was the vocals. Accompanied by a natural piano, a distorted voice sings, ""We are the synchronizers/ Send messages through time code."" And it is weird, like something Dean and Gene Ween would come up with. But with lines such as, ""We need to use envelope filters/ To say how we feel,"" the track is also an oddly beautiful lament. ""The Radiohead voice!"" Yes, a whispery version of the fitter, happier Macintalk voice makes an appearance on the love song, ""How Does It Make You Feel?"" But a real voice-- resident keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr.-- sings the ELO-inspired chorus. The beat, meanwhile, is cut from the exact same mold as The Virgin Suicides-- from the dark, ambling pace all the way down to the angelic voices coalescing in the background. But whereas that album-- and ""the Radiohead voice,"" for that matter-- remain serious to the end, this song concludes with a funny moment. After listing off his feelings, the male computerized voice receives an abrupt retort from a female computerized voice: ""Well, I really think you should quit smoking."" ""It's like rock-n-roll."" ""The Vagabond"" makes you wish for a full-length Beck/Air collaboration. But at first, it's all Beck: a harmonica solo, folky acoustic strumming, Beck's distinctive, marble-mouthed vocals, and tolls ringing in the background. You'd think he donated a b-side from Mutations. That's when Air's laser-gun atmospherics shoot forth. The drums that kick in midway are also decidedly more similar to Air's previous work. Beck even ends the number with his trademark falsetto and a cackling laugh a la ""Hollywood Freaks,"" so yes, she's right: this is rock-n-roll. But then again, a moment later she said, ""Honey, isn't rock-n-roll a weird name?"" ""Is this the same album?"" By the halfway mark, ""Lucky and Unhappy,"" the poor girl had been thrown for more than one loop-- not to mention ""Radian,"" Air's most overwrought Bacharach-inspired track to date. And now here was this untraceable throbbing, this eerie computerized whirring, voices of different distortions, and an acoustic guitar to ground it all; then a skittering beat and a swirling orchestra; and even later, static popping and off-key keyboards. Songs from the album's second half provided little relief. ""Sex Born Poison"" pairs a vocoderized voice with the Japanese vocals of Buffalo Daughter; then, for good measure, adds what sounds like digital Ping-Pong-- or maybe the noises ""Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!"" makes while Little Mac is popping King Hippo in the gut and mouth. After opening with a thick electro-pulse and digi-congos, the chantey ""People in the City"" reaches a simple acoustic epiphany-- think the Beta Band's ""Dry the Rain""-- before descending into muddled feedback and heavy electronic gurgling. And the final number, ""Caramel Prisoner,"" is an ambient come-down-- kind of like a rollercoaster coming to rest with a bloody, broken-nosed Fabio aboard. ""I like it, but it's kind of all over the place."" I'm a little scared to admit it, but we're on the same page here. The barely cohesive 10,000 Hz Legend is both a concern and a relief. There's only one truly catchy song-- the Low-era Bowie-esque ""Radio #1""-- but it doesn't have quite the same bounce (not to mention single potential) as ""Sexy Boy."" So you probably won't hear any of these songs on the radio, and I can say with absolute certainty that this won't be Details' album of the year, as Moon Safari was. I don't say this because it matters, but rather to indicate that Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\xEEt Dunckel have steadfastly refused to be pigeonholed. For better or worse, this is not Moon Safari Redux. The obvious comparison that my girlfriend should have made is to the Chemical Brothers, who took a similar stylistic leap on their last album, 1999's Surrender, even though staying the big-beat course would have been the easier and more profitable thing to do. But for some reason Spike Lee's work also comes to mind: there are plenty of hits and misses, but the experience is worth it for the invigorating knowledge that this critically established artist isn't afraid to take his art in new directions.

Argyle Heir,The Ladybug Transistor,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc68c0084474cd0c2aa7/1:1/w_160/f372067b.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4627-argyle-heir/,MergeMerge,"Wait a minute. That is just crazy. A Ladybug Transistor? A Ladybug Transistor? What kind of Ladybug needs a transistor? Some kind of weird robot bug, programmed to fly away home? Who would build such a thing? Or is the ladybug itself a transistor? What fanciful machine would have a Ladybug for a transistor? How would that work? The entire concept is making me insane. Still, I must pull it together, unblow my mind, and assess the music of Argyle Heir. What kind of crazy stockinged beneficiary is that!? These guys are crazy! Stop. Stop. Must focus. Okay, let's try this again: Do you love flutes? If so, you might love the fourth full-length studio album from this acclaimed Brooklyn combo. The crooning baritone, the angel-voiced backup vocals, and the gentle minstrel accompaniment might be exactly your thing. If you merely like flutes, you might still find this charming. After all, the Ladybug Transistor are very well received, critically. Check out Pitchfork's 8.0 for their previous release, The Albemarle Sound. They even had a poster featured in the movie High Fidelity! So who am I to object to their soft balladry? I like Belle and Sebastian and LT labelmates Magnetic Fields (singer Gary Olson would be a likely guest on some Stephen Merritt project). But maybe, if I'd found some other gentle, mellow, competently written records first, I wouldn't have warmed to those acts so much. Still, I think both Belle and Sebastian and the Magnetic Fields capture a melancholy that tempers their sweetness, at a quality above this. Maybe I can only take so much bathtub music. I have three Belle and Sebastian records and sixty-nine Magnetic Fields songs. Sixty-nine of them! I'm full up! Mellowness aside, how are the songs? The opener, ""Fire On the Ocean,"" stops and starts effectively, and features some useful tempo changes. As does ""The Glass Pane,"" along with some nice country picking. ""Echoes"" has a peaceful, Grateful Dead-type lilt to it. Really, though, there's a lot of sameness on Argyle Heir, and not nearly enough differentiation. The lyrics, while not cute or over-psychedelic, are fairly abstract and don't tell much of a story. And, for all the melodic importance to the record, I don't catch myself humming any of the tunes when I'm lying around in my sunroom. I hear all the instruments moving around up and down the scale, but these tunes don't seem to have the hands to grab with. Olson's voice is nice, if uninvested emotionally, and he's missed when instrumental such as ""Going Up North (Icicles)"" and ""Fjords of Winter"" take us inside the elevator. It's not that they can't help their gentle ways; the Ladybug Transistor (man, that name continues to just absolutely blow my mind!) betray that they can step up the energy almost as high as Crosby, Stills and Nash with one teaser that fades in and out (a là Beatles by way of Pavement) featuring backtracked guitars. Maybe if you play Argyle Heir backward it will rock. To the band's credit, this is a fully realized album. I just don't want to come to the same realization. Four composers all sound like the same creator. Songs are nicely brief, achieving all their modest ambitions, and end without fuss. The strings and bouncy keyboards, and of course, the flute, overlap well. And while I could do without this much flutery, I'm never aggravated by any Bacharachian gestures. With this kind of music, it's easy to slip into cute moves, and with the exception of the Merry Olde English waltz time silliness of ""Catherine Elizabeth,"" the Ladybug Transistor avoid this. In fact, despite the thoughtfulness of the arrangements, it quickly becomes clear that nothing truly surprising will ever happen. This act could learn from another labelmate, Neutral Milk Hotel, about the possibility for arrangement to enhance and transport instead of merely tastefully support a song. Of course, it's easy to stumble when pursuing such adventures, but that's what we expect our artists to risk. They cannot just make pleasant music that does not actually excite. Plus, Ladybug Transistor!!! I still can't get over it.","Wait a minute. That is just crazy. A Ladybug Transistor? A Ladybug Transistor?\n\ What kind of Ladybug needs a ...

Even My Sure Things Fall Through EP,Calexico,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d5b1335d7bf1698a66/1:1/w_160/761687f0.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1231-even-my-sure-things-fall-through-ep/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"Chances are, Calexico is a lot more interesting than the town you grew up in. Oh, sure, your town had that kid who painted ""Zool"" on every stop sign in town and evenings of cow-tipping adventure, but few American towns have as fractious a history as this California burg situated just inside the US, across the dotted line from Mexicali. The two towns were once one, with residents passing freely from one nation to the other to work, socialize and shop-- the picture of peaceful neighbors. But times change. As state and federal bureaucrats began to view Mexican immigration as a national problem, the border between Calexico and Mexicali was closed ever tighter. Jobs were lost, relationships were severed, and the way of life once enjoyed by locals was irrevocably changed. Calexico remained small and retained a high standard of living, while Mexicali's population exploded and sank into poverty. Joey Burns and John Convertino make exactly the kind of music you'd expect a duo that took their name from an embattled desert town to make. It conjures images of sand-blasted fence posts, cattle skulls, and wind-blown expanses of rock and sand, and draws nearly as much from Mexican musical traditions as it does from American indie rock. In addition to other side work, Burns and Convertino have laid down the rhythmic backbone for Doug McCombs' Brokeback project, collaborated with the Amor Belhom Duo as ABBC, and are veterans of desert rock outfits Giant Sand and Friends of Dean Martinez. Their diverse past shows in their firm grasp of disparate styles. Even My Sure Things Fall Through is an eight-song EP drawn from various European b-sides, but it feels a lot more substantial than your typical tide-me-over compilation. Two of these tracks appeared in different incarnations on last year's excellent Hot Rail album-- ""Sonic Wind"" and ""Untitled III."" ""Sonic Wind"" is presented here as an instrumental, refurbished with Jacob Valenzuela's clarion trumpet lines. Two Lone Swordsmen have their way with the interlude ""Untitled III,"" removing the accordion from the mix and filtering the acoustic bass for a vacuum-packed effect. And the slow hip-hop beat, erratic maraca, and digital squelches that enter later never remove the track from its dusty setting. Joey Burns, whose warm singing voice just keeps improving with experience, directly addresses the plight of the band's namesake town on ""Crystal Frontier,"" which shows up here in two versions. The ""Widescreen Version"" features full mariachi accompaniment and is easily one of the best songs Calexico have recorded. Its video-- one of three included on the CD-- features footage of poverty-stricken Mexicali and signs announcing the last U-turn before Mexico to complement the song's story of failed immigration attempts and deportations. The acoustic version that appears later is Burns by himself, giving a haunting rendition that's as essential as the original. Calexico's burned-out take on Mark Eitzel's ""Chanel No. 5,"" feels appropriately exhausted to handle Eitzel's aching tale of longing. When Tim Gallagher's steel guitar intones, it's enough to make the hardiest cowhand cry just a little in his beer. ""Banderilla"" kicks off with a mariachi outfit sucked into a black hole before sliding into a subdued groove. Burns' confident bassline propels it nicely, but it's one of the few moments that feels too familiar. Calexico have been here before, on the almost identical ""El Picador,"" from Hot Rail. ""Crooked Road and the Briar"" salvages things quickly, though, with gritty, meaty desert rock. The record winds to a close with the seven-minute ""Hard Hat,"" a softly swelling soundscape littered with dying AM radio transmissions. An extension of Calexico's ambient experiments with ABBC, ""Hard Hat"" crawls in from oblivion, the aural equivalent of a wasted ghost town. The swelling drones and shifting textures recall the best moments of Angus MacLaurin's Glass Music or a young Pink Floyd's quieter ambient experiments. Burns and Convertino have rapidly crafted what began as a side project into one of the best bands on the American indie rock landscape. Even My Sure Things Fall Through displays a band with an amazing range of capabilities and a veritable stylistic grab bag to draw from. At 37 minutes, it's a hefty listen for an EP, and with the added value of three great videos in the enhanced portion, it's hard to say no. Anyone interested in the Southwestern sound would do well to check this out.","Chances are, Calexico is a lot more interesting than the town you grew up in. Oh, sure, your town had ...

Flowers,Echo and the Bunnymen,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf3ea9e61561daa7367/1:1/w_160/7602b96b.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2669-flowers/,spinARTCooking Vinyl,"Twenty-one years after they released their 1980 Sire Records debut, Crocodiles, Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant are still parading their love of Jim Morrison, Arabic scales and quasi-religious imagery. Though far mellower than their debut, their latest offering, Flowers, nonetheless links us back to the Northern England post-punk scene so strewn with memories and the shed skins of so many legendary bands. Gone are the Chameleons, the Teardrop Explodes, and Joy Division. So what have the survivors left to offer us, in a world where Mudvayne and System of a Down capture young hearts and minds? The short answer is, of course, another 45 minute expression of the band's love of Jim Morrison, Arabic scales, and quasi-religious imagery. At least they haven't gone big beat. Yes, the boys are still doing what they've always done best, and despite the slight Gallagher Brothers influence on ""Hide and Seek,"" only Echo and the Bunnymen could have written the bulk of Flowers. They make their voices heard loud and clear on the opener, ""King of Kings,"" a song which spreads out the three objects of their affection with a vibraphone grasping the few remaining Middle Eastern tonalities that Will Sergeant's guitar hasn't grabbed for itself. McCulloch, unafraid of confronting the listener from the get-go, opens the album with a theological whopper in which Christ confesses his fears of witnessing ""what happens when the soul dies."" Though ""Supermellowman"" lives up to its title (especially when McCulloch strains to sing, ""Life came without warning""), we have to wait until the fourth and fifth tracks, ""Make Me Shine"" and ""It's Alright,"" for the big chorus songs. ""Make Me Shine"" is ""Pale Blue Eyes"" meets ""Tambourine Man"" as if produced by Todd Rundgren; ""It's Alright"" could have found a place on the Nuggets II box set had it been recorded 35 years ago and its watery effects pedal had been available in those days. Both are classic Bunnymen. Taking ""Sweet Jane"" as its model, ""Buried Alive"" is the Flowers' memento mori. McCulloch sings about childhoods coming to end too soon and how ""life is just to die."" Such morose sentiments sound believable and less like youthful sloganeering coming from McCulloch these days. A theremin traces through the grinding guitars and singalong chorus of the track, which recalls the band's Gil Norton-produced self-titled album. ""Everybody Knows"" leans on ""The Cutter"" as McCulloch happily croons about ""going round my last bend."" ""Life Goes On"" has an awkward skiffle-y Proclaimers vibe to it that the band redeems with the slithering ""An Eternity Turns."" And then, Flowers closes with the mature ballad, ""Burn for Me,"" which reminds us that the band are not actually the bolshy scruffs in long raincoats we adored two decades ago. Nonetheless, I adore Flowers because of nostalgia. McCulloch and Sergeant have maintained a bridge to the late 20th century, a time when my hair didn't recede and I could get away with back-combing. Of course, because Flowers doesn't maintain the urgency of Echo and the Bunnymen's early records, it's not the place to begin any investigation into their trippy delights. But for us old-timers who remember reading NME before the editorial policy changed to shameless oh-so ironic hyping of teen pop acts, Flowers stands as a gorgeous bouquet of memories.","Twenty-one years after they released their 1980 Sire Records debut, Crocodiles, Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant are still parading their ...

I Poo Poo on Your Juju,Third Eye Foundation,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77e13d1975652139415/1:1/w_160/9a78e6bc.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8011-i-poo-poo-on-your-juju/,MergeMerge,"Did you have trouble finding the Foundation? No doubt you were lured by those piano lines, those minor key chords waltzing through the streets of Bristol. Come, meet me at the landing; our founder Matt Elliot favored it during his days in Flying Saucer Attack. Have you heard the disembodied vocal sample that has appeared and reappeared time and again? Surely, it's tucked deep in your mind like a repressed memory. You remember it from the Peel Sessions record, when it sang on ""Some Pitying Angel,"" and from Little Lost Soul, on the track called ""Lost."" This sweet voice has returned, like a will o' the wisp come to lighten the murky swamp, on ""La Dispute,"" a remix of a work by French filmscorer Yann Tiersen. A haunting melody, to be sure, with accordion underlying... but those lyrics! ""So you say the world is lonely/ You are alone..."" But our Mr. Elliot was always the dramatic one, wasn't he? My lass, you seem familiar with the reconstruction work done at the Foundation. In each room, you'll find a client in search of a certain inner nature which yearns to be brought to fruition. Take, for example, Tarwater here in the parlor. Their original piece, ""To Describe You,"" charmed and delighted with reminiscences typical of the Berliners: a distorted echo, metallic in timbre, a mellotronic flute melody, and the whispered song title. Mr. Elliot took these ambient whims and condensed them, feeding locomotive drum breaks that pick up speed and threaten to careen off the tracks. Hold the handrail, dear, as we descend. An early diagnosis: you suffer from rhythmic redundancy, a condition brought on by exposure to generic brand beats. Urchin did much the same, until Mr. Elliot had a brush with ""Snuffed Candles."" Trip-hop drums once crippled with age have become limber! Sub-bass hits looped with crisp toms whirl madly around, thrusting digital snarls and scratches into the air! He applies more of a sweeping motion to the ""Remote Viewer,"" however, brushing together various strands of antique acoustics and digital detritus, and watching them eddy about. One feels distracted, constantly casting eyes about as if having imbibed a tincture of laudanum... oh, but rest assured, love, the sweet taste of this melancholy equals the bitter. Some of our guests require more delicate handling than others. Inevitably, extreme methods must be resorted to. Mr. Elliot was recently visited by British comedic prankster Chris Morris, for instance, and the two concocted a disturbing brew. It begins not unlike Spring Heel Jack's twisted take on those Tortoise fellows, with ominous bass hearkening back to the Third Eye Foundation's jungle period. Soon, imbecilic stammering and demonic squeals (minions seemingly sampled from Morris' voice) give rise to a clamor, buffeted about by a repeating steel drum sound. During Blonde Redhead's stay here, the opposite pole was reached-- ""Four Damaged Lemons"" strips to nothing but sepia-toned piano, drone and Kazu Makino's strangulated cry. At the Foundation, one must delve to emotional depths, even revel in them, before rising. Listen to her defeated warble: ""Don't be a fool, make it easier/ You learn to say when/ Signal when you can't breathe no more..."" Delicious. You may realize I've been referring to Matt Elliot in the past tense. He has not left us, but this collection of collaborations will be his last as the Foundation. He has a boy now, you see, and intends to leave the gloom behind. The remix of Faultline's ""MUTE"" reveals the cracks along which his identity has split. Massive, pane-shaking, stone-cracking drum and bass emanates throughout, the only overt evidence of his Ghost album. You'll also find splinters of his guitar strewn in wild electric torrents, a remnant of his early ""Semtex."" But all things must pass, and rumors abound that his next project will abandon both for a more positive, uplifting approach. So settle back, child, the final number is a special treat. Acoustic frets sharply struck combine with rumbling, haphazard percussion for a hiccuping rhythm. A woman known only as Glanta lays her velvet rasp atop the slow groove, as compelling as any swing-period chanteuse. She sings of a party during which her urges get the best of her, specifically the libidinal gyrations often justified as the ""dance."" A moment of déjà vu-- this is a Jonathan Richman cover, though Glanta is more convincing, I think: ""I've got them all in my trance, when I dance."" It is hard to deny the hypnotic nature of the constant skip-scratch of needle drawn across vinyl. The fuzzy purr of the phonograph production wraps around you like a lover's arms, pulling you down into its bed. Tomorrow, we'll work on what ails you; for now, just listen. You'll sleep well.","Did you have trouble finding the Foundation? No doubt you were lured by\n\ those piano lines, those minor key ...

Looking for Leonard,Portastatic,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f413d19756521384fe/1:1/w_160/ef484fc3.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6417-looking-for-leonard/,MergeMerge,"""Any of you fuckin' pricks move, and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you."" Things haven't been the same since that line from Pulp Fiction was sequenced into the beginning of the surf number that opens the ubiquitous soundtrack. It wasn't the first to prominently feature movie dialogue and relatively obscure music, but it was the first of its kind to be hugely popular. From then on, it became clear that you didn't need a John Williams composition or Whitney Houston's squeal to have success. Now, of course, you've got soundtracks featuring songs that aren't even in the movie. For the soundtrack is no longer just an accompaniment for the movie-goer-- it's an album all its own. And you know it's moved from a trend to a standard when an indie staple such as Superchunk (and Merge Records) frontman Mac McCaughan-- under his side-project/alter ego Portastatic-- is slipping interesting dialogue into his soundtrack to the Canadian indie film, Looking for Leonard: ""Excuse me,"" a man says. ""Do you speak English?"" ""Fuck off,"" a woman replies. ""I just thought I should warn you you're being obvious."" The woman denies stealing until the man points out the items she lifted. Then she questions his motivations, eventually asking: ""Then what the fuck do you want?"" ""I'm just trying to be helpful."" ""Are you fucking with me?"" ""No."" ""Are you serious?"" ""Yes."" During these last lines, where vicious skepticism shifts to unabashed hope, an acoustic guitar, light drum pattering and Margaret White's staccato violin fade in to ignite your visual imagination. A belated theremin only brightens the colors. Unless you've seen this unreleased movie, all you can do is wonder. Thus, Looking for Leonard shares one thing with blockbuster soundtracks, which often come out weeks before the movie: whether it meant to or not-- okay, probably not-- it acts as a promotional device. That's not all it does, though. It swings, skips, mopes, loves, dreams-- in other words, it acts like a movie. Hints of last year's De Mel, De Melão, an EP of Brazilian covers, emerge sporadically throughout this 34-minute, entirely instrumental album. It opens, as most soundtracks do, with the title theme, which introduces those beautiful strings, as well as a quavering organ and a soaring guitar. It's the perfect mix of McCaughan's two major interests, combining the romanticism and wistfulness of tropicalia with the grounded guitarwork of Superchunk. The final number, ""Sweethearts of the World,"" opens with plaintive Brazilian horns before breaking into an infectious blend of thumping drums, multiple guitars strumming and picking, and, yes, mercurial strings. The incidental music that rests between these structured, bookending songs is more mood-oriented. Neither good nor bad, just there. Sometimes it's just a ringing tone and some slumping drumbeats, or simply the hum of a melodic organ, or maybe it's a slow, strummy passage you'd expect from Calexico. Looking for Leonard is, without question, a film score. Most of the songs are hardly songs, in the structural sense, and the only batch of dialogue hasn't grown old yet. Furthermore, fans of McCaughan's forays outside of indie rock will not be disappointed, whether or not they've seen the film. Basically, Looking for Leonard is a good soundtrack made the old-fashioned way. You know, before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny stormed our speakers with guns and bile.","""Any of you fuckin' pricks move, and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one\n\ of you.""

Ovalcommers,Oval,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba20ea9e61561daa7151/1:1/w_160/db260b1a.jpg,2001-05-22 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6066-ovalcommers/,Thrill Jockey,"If Markus Popp is misunderstood, he has no one but himself to blame. When your interviews include answers like, ""My music is embedded in a very concrete, completely tangible, everyday workflow far less occupied with theoretical notions of debatable authorship and digital discourse,"" to questions like, ""Dude, did you, like, work out the songs beforehand or pretty much put this album together in the studio?"" you can expect people to miss where you're coming from. Two misperceptions about Popp are that he makes ambient music and all his work sounds the same. In the watershed year 1994, the ambient label almost applied, due in part to Oval's composition process at the time. That year, Popp, along with then-collaborators Sebastian Oschatz and Frank Metzger, decided to take copies of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II, apply a magic marker to the CD surface, and record and manipulate the ensuing tracking errors. This resulted in a beautiful audio object called Systemische, a record that proved hugely influential in the experimental electronic community. And yes, it was generally placid enough to be categorized alongside Music for Airports. But I defy anyone to listen to Ovalcommers' first track and think of Brian Eno. It begins with a two-note riff that prudent car alarm manufacturers should consider licensing, and then slides into a massive pit of raging black sound, full of bassed-out distortion and explosions of static. The opening siren continues to wail and actually takes on a pathetic quality as it drowns inside the din; you begin to feel sorry for that annoying little sound, so overwhelming is the clamor surrounding it. Though every Oval record has a unique flavor, Ovalcommers is the most radical shift yet, one that easily dispels the second misperception. We saw glimmers of this development in 1999 with Szenariodisk, a gorgeous EP (my favorite Oval record next to 94diskont) that found Oval cutting exceptionally detailed sound figurines out of slabs of sonic chaos. At that point, Oval's sources began to acquire a prickly edge, as an increasing amount of information being stuffed through an ever-narrowing pipe had caused the protective coating to fray. Still, on Szenariodisk, controlled, icy beauty was the order of the day. On the full-length follow-up, Ovalprocess, Popp reigned in the discord and experimented with conventional sounds (the album is filled with organ chords), creating a warm, enveloping environment that throughout could still be called ""pretty."" The adjective seldom applies to Ovalcommers. On this record, every sound is in constant danger of being shoved into the red. The most common elements-- sampled guitar plucks, an organ-like synth patch laced with static, modem transmissions, assorted drones-- appear and reappear over the course of the record, yet they remain in constant motion. Any complaints I've had recently about the ""grid"" that rules over time in computer-generated music do not apply here; the patterns of Ovalprocess would take years for me to understand completely. Loops are used as accent, not to drive composition. Most prominent of these is the thing that set Oval apart initially: the now ubiquitous CD skip. It seems a relief when it first appears on Ovalcommers as Track 1 becomes Track 2 (the idea of Popp naming his pieces now seems silly) and the initial blast slips down to a manageable level. The CD skip has been incorporated into every past record except for Dok (a strange release that now sticks out of the catalog like a sore thumb), and Ovalcommers is no exception. People are tiring of the sound and I can relate. If nothing else, it's puzzling. Why has it stayed around so long, even outside of Oval? Why didn't Christian Marclay's memes multiply in the same way? Despite it all, for me, an Oval record without the trademark skip is like a Built to Spill album sans guitar. Most of those who've run with the glitch have used it in a minimal context, but Oval is moving in the other direction. This is an album packed with abrasive tones of unimaginable density and uncertain origin. Oval shares with Autechre the ability to craft sounds that defy explanation. The human hearing system simply was not built with this record in mind. It's like trying to graph the emotional intent of a tropical storm. The listener has to fight a million years of evolution just to pay close attention, and when he does, there is no system of classification in place to describe it. It's clear that Oval has left pastures of beauty behind and is ready to ride wild and free in Merzbow country. Calling this album ambient is a joke; with Ovalcommers, Popp brings the noise.",,7.8,
Pneumonia,Whiskeytown,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa129d034d5c69bf3d8e/1:1/w_160/bba82f04.jpg,2001-05-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8645-pneumonia/,Lost Highway,"Categorization has been widely accepted as a positive concept that, since the beginning of civilization, has enhanced (and advanced) human life through simplification. Ketchup is a condiment; thus, it can be found in aisle five. Simple. But every such concept has a negative side. A particular man is a homosexual; thus, he is not allowed to be legally married. Not so simple. As a form of categorization, the critical practice of genre-naming also purports to serve a beneficial purpose for the greater good. Were I to call Pneumonia ""alt-country,"" for instance, my goal would be to act as a filter for the readers pouring through this review. Anyone who despises country in any form won't read any further. Anyone who likes or simply tolerates country, or whose interest is piqued by ""alt-,"" will continue reading until the next, more specific categorical filter. But how does utilitarianism fit into music anyway? In terms of normative ethics, I suppose it promotes happiness. Still, I have a hard time viewing an album as a tool with a specific utility. Ultimately, genre-naming is constricting: it may steer the decision-making process, but that in itself is not necessarily a good thing. You can call something ""alt-country,"" but it still might sound like an incontinent cow. On the flip side, an album described as, say, ""Celtic hip-hop,"" might be ill in a good way. I suppose this is a long-winded way of saying I don't want to label this album as ""alt-country,"" or any of the other synonymous labels that critics list ad nauseam (no depression, etc.). If you've already told yourself, ""I have enough alt-country albums. What I need is even more of that post-rock,"" then you're missing out on what could be the best, er, folk- and country-influenced pop/rock album of the year. Uh, yeah. The point is that this is good. Well, that's one point. Another point: if you liked Heartbreaker, last year's debut solo album from Whiskeytown frontman Ryan Adams, then you won't be disappointed by Pneumonia, the band's third and final full-length. Reportedly recorded in an abandoned church in upstate New York in 1999-- not long before Adams ended the band-- the album was neglected after Outpost Records disappeared amidst the Polygram/Universal merger. Like the Red House Painters' Old Ramon, released earlier this year, this ""lost"" album was not done a disservice by the wait. As I hinted, Pneumonia sounds more like a Ryan Adams solo effort than a Whiskeytown album. Of course, Whiskeytown has undergone so many changes since their 1996 debut, Faithless Street, that Adams, the lead songwriter and vocalist, and fiddler Caitlin Cary are the only original members remaining. But the ""Whiskeytown sound,"" if it can be said to exist-- some call it Uncle Tupelo meets the Replacements-- is hard to find amidst this cleaner, simpler sound. And the sonic consistency that marked their heretofore best effort, 1997's Stranger's Almanac, is all but extinct. The ride begins with the rambling, harmonica- and piano-driven ""The Ballad of Carol Lynn,"" which is The Band seen through the eyeglass of Dylan's influence. ""Loving you has gotten weird,"" Adams begins in his distinct wail, accompanied by subtle horns and woodwinds. During the chorus, he declares, ""When you need a friend to be there for you/ I won't be one who will help you out/ When you need someone who can let you/ You can count me out, oh Caroline."" The sound may not be as edgy, but Adams remains as unforgiving as ever. After the sufficiently upbeat ""Don't Wanna Know Why,"" which is highlighted by Cary's fiddle and complementary voice, Pneumonia settles down for two low-key numbers accentuated by Adams' croon and pedal steel. The album then begins to rise with ""Don't Be Sad,"" a perfect little reflective rock song held aloft by an almost shoegazer-like rolling out of light electric picking. ""Sit and Listen to the Rain,"" with its mandolin and organic keyboards, will have you thinking R.E.M. circa Out of Time-- that is, until the halting, atmospheric chorus. The album becomes even more varied. After the pretty, but lulling ""Under Your Breath,"" ""Mirror, Mirror"" shows Adams aiming-- and nailing-- pop that melds Beatles-esque romping with R&B; female backup singing and triumphant horns. This is followed by ""Paper Moon,"" none other than a Hawaiian love drift with a Flamenco chorus. The pace is further slowed by perhaps the album's best moment, ""What the Devil Wanted,"" which is little more than vinyl static, a drowning piano, and Adams' voice (included are the occasional organ and tolling bell). When he repeats during the chorus, ""All my time is wasteful now,"" he has certainly hit his most poignant moment. While hardly uniform, the four remaining tracks, plus a forgettable hidden track-- all of which are relatively light-- end the album on an unadventurous note, genre-wise. But they're not enough to spoil an otherwise wild ride that precludes the album from being pigeonholed as ""alt-country,"" in spite of Whiskeytown's somewhat generic bandname.

The Invisible Man,Mark Eitzel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc17ea9e61561daa73bf/1:1/w_160/14dc8ca2.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2703-the-invisible-man/,MatadorMatador,"The toad's internal organs surged from its mouth as Brian's mother accidentally stepped on it. Brian had noticed the toad sitting on the grass just in time to witness its gruesome death, and stared for a few seconds before throwing up his hands and shouting, ""The universe sucks!"" Brian is fond of decrying the injustices of our chaotic environment, and perhaps no other single anecdote supports his rantings better. There was no reason for what happened to that toad. It just happened. Of course, Brian's simple three-word theory is applicable everywhere, and not just in the natural world. It was at work when Beta succumbed to VHS, despite being the superior format. It's at work every time Fox cancels a good TV show and replaces it with police chase videos. And it's at work almost constantly in the music industry, a world where the Britneys and the Backstreets rule the charts while so many true artists toil in the depths of commercial hell, neglected by a public hungry for eye candy and a quick thrill. While many artists have suffered similar fates, few have typified it the way Mark Eitzel has. Put simply, Eitzel possesses one of the most impressive oeuvres of any songwriter, living or dead. Even the perpetually clueless Rolling Stone couldn't ignore the man's genius, naming him Songwriter of the Year back in 1991. Despite his complete mastery of the craft, though, he's never seen his day in the spotlight, and at this point in his career, it seems unlikely that he ever will. The public at large isn't interested in music this brutally honest. All the more for you and me, I suppose. Transplanted in the early 80's from his boyhood home of Columbus, Ohio to the San Francisco Bay Area, Eitzel fronted the tragically overlooked American Music Club. Over the course of AMC's seven albums, Eitzel penned some of the greatest, most heartfelt tales of degradation, struggle, and sadness in modern music, finding his muse in dank bars, empty beds and lonely nights. When AMC finally called it quits in 1994 after a stalled deal with Reprise, Eitzel struck out on his own, releasing the jazzy 60 Watt Silver Lining and the fantastic Peter Buck collaboration West on Warner before the label left him on the curb. The good folks at Matador picked him up for 1998's cheekily titled Caught in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'Cause I Love You Too Much Baby, a starkly beautiful album that was almost aborted due to the difficulty of making it. Three years later, Eitzel is still on his feet, though the weight of the world has hardly been lifted from his shoulders. The Invisible Man is perhaps his best solo effort yet, and nearly the equal of AMC's greatest triumph, Everclear. Greatness, of course, is a given where Eitzel is involved, but perhaps the most stunning thing about The Invisible Man is the fact that, so many years on, he's embraced electronics and emerged with an album that sounds utterly contemporary and vital. ""The Boy with the Hammer"" starts things off with deeply echoed piano and Eitzel's powerful voice singing, ""When the boy with the hammer in the bag stands up to cheer/ Then you stand up to cheer,"" as ambient washes rise like an ether fog, pushed along by a mix of skittering beats and live percussion. Eitzel has always checked Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream as influences, but they've never come to the fore like this in the past. ""Can You See?"" finds Eitzel balancing his world-weariness with a newfound trace of optimism: ""You say that another man's hell could be your heaven/ And if this is being blind and wrong give me more and more/ And let me light up the hand and let me pull the truth through/ But if the truth won't make you happy/ What would you do?/ The truth is that I'm happy when I'm with you."" The understated electronics burbling underneath combine with knockout horn arrangement to wrap around Eitzel's confessions like a warm blanket. Goosebumps ensue. The hilarious march of ""Christian Science Reading Room"" is Eitzel's black humor at its best. ""I was so high/ I stood for an hour outside the Christian Science Reading Room/ And suddenly I could not resist/ I became a Christian Scientist/ And I studied light and I studied sound/ And every question that I asked was suddenly profound."" He goes on to convert his cat before declaring, ""I love all seven deadly sins,"" in the opening of ""Sleep."" This is the point, where, as a reviewer, my job becomes difficult. There are thirteen songs on this album and every single one of them is tremendous in its own right. I could spend the rest of this review quoting lyrics and never truly convey the power of these songs. Eitzel has a creepy way of finding all the thoughts you have hanging next to the skeletons in your closet and conveying them succinctly and effortlessly. So rather than participate in a futile exercise like trying to describe how good this music is, I'll go for the big wrap-up and hope that I can convince you that this is totally worth listening to. It's way too early to declare anything the Album of the Year, but I will say that this one holds the top spot on my list by a long shot so far. Eitzel and his small group of talented cohorts have created a textured soundtrack to the outpourings of a broken heart that never once intrudes on the honesty of the proceedings. Every bleep and skitter is there to serve the song. Exploring new territory while maintaining the emotional weight of your material is rarely a working prospect for an artist, but The Invisible Man pulls it off nicely. Eitzel may still be the invisible man in many respects, but as long as he keeps translating his sorrow and suffering into batches of killer songs like this, we as listeners get to be the lucky beneficiaries. On the drunkenly jubilant closer, ""Proclaim Your Joy,"" Eitzel exhorts us half-seriously that ""it is important throughout your life to proclaim your joy."" And with this album in your stereo, I think it's safe to say that you will.","The toad's internal organs surged from its mouth as Brian's mother accidentally stepped on it. Brian had noticed ...

You Should Know by Now,Barbara Manning,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c399eb335119a49ed752/1:1/w_160/f3246743.gif,2001-05-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5085-you-should-know-by-now/,InnerstateInnerstate,"Barbara Manning is cool. She's the original indie troubadour, a music fan living out a music fan's ultimate dream: travelling the world over to play and record with her favorite musicians (all of whom are plenty cool in their own right). She's so cool that she actually made Matador Records cooler when she was on their roster, instead of the other way around. So, yes, Barbara Manning is a mighty cool person, and her unassuming, folksy, thoughtful jangle-pop has attracted a sizable cult following that may soon be calling for my head on a pike, once they see the lukewarm rating I've given You Should Know by Now. (Or maybe not, since most of the Barbara Manning fans I've met are pretty mellow, but you never know.) But it would be truly dishonest of me to say that You Should Know by Now is anywhere near the quality of her past work. In fact, it's surprising that Manning has maintained such consistent quality over the years, what with her constant label-jumping and perennial backing-band changes. When she has the likes of the Verlaines' Graeme Downes or Calexico, as on 1212 and In New Zealand, she can be golden; similarly, the albums she recorded for Matador, both solo and with the SF Seals, have the virtue of larger budgets and more studio time. However, You Should Know by Now seems to have been created under less than ideal circumstances, resulting in a decent if uninspired album. I'm not trying to shift the blame to Manning's current backing band, the Go-Luckys (Flavio and Fabrizio Steinbach-- I just wanted to mention them because they have great names). In fact, the one track penned exclusively by the brothers Steinbach-- the churning, forceful instrumental ""Boston Song""-- is quite good. But they were apparently unable to add any distinctive angles to Manning's sound, which at this point could use a little updating; more than once on this album, the scrubby guitar and jumpy drums were uncomfortably reminiscent of early-90's Lemonheads, cuddly but disposable. Manning has a knack for writing songs that sound comfortable and familiar on the first listen, but only occasionally on You Should Know by Now is she able to use it to her advantage and make a chord progression or vocal melody completely her own. Too often she sounds like a less compelling version of other insecure girls with guitars-- Mary Timony, Juliana Hatfield, Elizabeth Elmore, etc. She can devolve into sing-songy preciousness too easily, as on ""Goof on the Roof"" (which even features a musical saw, for crying out loud), or choose a style not well-suited to her talents (on the supposedly chipper ""You Knock Me Out,"" her plain voice sounds so deadpan that she seems less knocked out than merely tapped on the shoulder). Perhaps its Manning's tendency to let her songs slouch about that I can't get into, because she sounds so much better when she's commanding. The faster, buzzier numbers here-- ""Don't Neglect Yourself,"" with its snarling, Donnas-like riff, and the pitched, frantic frustration of ""Buds Won't Bud""-- are pleasingly compact. And among the more melancholy, minor-key numbers, ""Incapable"" simmers with sad tension. Manning has said that she dislikes being the sole creative force in a band, which may offer some justification for her many collaborations. You Should Know By Now is her most self-reliant release to date-- there are no covers and few joint songwriting credits-- and, sure enough, it's one of her weakest releases. There's enough here to keep the dedicated Manning fan satisfied, but newcomers would do well to look elsewhere for a better introduction, such as her work with the SF Seals or (if you can find them) earlier solo albums such as Lately I Keep Scissors and One Perfect Green Blanket.","Barbara Manning is cool.

Can Our Love...,Tindersticks,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7bdc0084474cd0c0c76/1:1/w_160/62311f48.gif,2001-05-21 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8074-can-our-love/,Beggars Banquet,"I'd like to begin this review by congratulating Tindersticks on making it for over a decade with the same six members. Most bands don't even make it the full ten years, much less with all members intact. I've been trying to think of other bands who have done it and after a few minutes of staring around at my record collection, Fugazi, Radiohead, and REM are the only names I've come up with, and even REM doesn't have Bill Berry anymore. Aside from those, you have revolving doors like Yes and Fleetwood Mac, both of whom have had over twenty members over the years, and short-lived outfits like the Sex Pistols, who couldn't stay together long enough to complete their first US tour. So, it's a testament to the strength of the band that Tindersticks are still at it after all these years, democratically crafting some of the best music in Britain. And it's equally impressive that their quality has hardly suffered at all in the process. The music of Tindersticks has changed a lot in the last few years, absorbing 70's soul into their signature gutter ballads, and dropping the ""melo"" prefix from the drama. Gone are the 70 minute-plus double-albums and ear-rattling dissonance that characterized their early music, replaced instead by concise, slow-core R&B; with an inky black center. Still, it would impossible to mistake this for any other band, and old fans will likely be delighted with what they hear. The opener, ""Dying Slowly,"" is the most direct musical link to the band's past, recalling the string-drenched pining of their third album, Curtains. Stuart Staples' murky baritone calls out the refrain, ""This dying slowly/ It seemed better than shooting myself,"" with characteristic exhaustion. The strings swell and subside like the conversation in a crowded bar. It's an elegant introduction to an album that finds Tindersticks further embracing the soul influences they first toyed with on 1999's Simple Pleasure. A case in point is the title track, a bubbling stew of wah-wah guitars, Hammond organ and passionate vocals that plays like Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get It On"" at half-speed, only with Here, My Dear sentiments in the lyrics. Even after all this time, Stuart Staples can't seem to win at the game of love. ""Sweet Release,"" the album's eight-minute centerpiece, follows, displaying the band's uncanny ability to play an extremely long song and make it feel too short. Dickon Hinchliffe's violin swirls around Staples' molasses-thick vocal and David Boulter's gorgeous organ lines, as the twelve-member string section comments from the wings. It makes for a song that easily lives up to its title. Part of what makes Tindersticks so easy to connect to is the way they manage to make even the most minute suffering and pain seem universal. When Staples sighs, he's sighing with you, and when he says ""I,"" it could be anybody who's ever been through a messy breakup or felt the sting of rejection. And that's why his plea of ""Don't ever get tired of waiting for me"" on ""Don't Ever Get Tired"" hits a nerve-- everyone needs someone they can depend on, and Staples just wants it to be the woman he loves. ""People Keep Comin' Around,"" a duet between Staples and Hinchliffe, offers perhaps a little insight into why Tindersticks have been able to last so long-- all six members are genuinely unselfish musicians. Bassist Mark Colwill and drummer Alasdair Macaulay lay down a relaxed but funky groove as Boulter and guitarist Neil Fraser lay back, playing only when necessary. Hinchliffe's higher octave is animated, but never hogs the spotlight, letting the band ride the groove, while Hinchliffe's rich string and horn arrangements fill in the gaps. It's telling that the band offers equal billing to the string and horn players in the album credits, acknowledging their contributions as equal to the end result. In fact, the only faltering point on the entire album actually comes when Staples strikes out on his own for the puzzling ""Tricklin',"" a two-minute vocal round with minimalist organ accompaniment that doesn't really serve as much more than filler. But when the whole band is engaged, the results are frequently stunning, and always engaging. The final twist on Can Our Love... comes with the closer, ""Chilitetime,"" where, for once, hope seems to be the order of the day. ""She has my love/ She needs something more/ But time is mine,"" Staples sings as Hinchliffe's violin cries out behind him. And that's where the ellipsis in the album title comes in, I think. It leaves the thought ""Can our love..."" incomplete and allows you draw your own conclusions. While things are definitely bad, there may yet be a way out. Despite the open-ended nature of its sentiments, ""Chilitetime"" pulls the album to a strong close, effectively capping this latest journey through the dark folds of the brain and the heart. At 45 minutes, Can Our Love... is Tindersticks' most concise album yet, and it sacrifices nothing in content. Eight songs may not seem like much for a full album, but it's all this band needs to make a fully rewarding listen that only gets richer the more you visit.","I'd like to begin this review by congratulating Tindersticks on making it for over a decade with the same ...

My Red Hot Car EP,Squarepusher,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52eea9e61561daa5093/1:1/w_160/6a98e26e.gif,2001-05-21 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7445-my-red-hot-car-ep/,Warp,"You know, this is a pretty good time to be alive. We're at least a generation past a major war, and (hopefully) a few more generations away from global apocalypse. Tasty mass-produced food products are cheap and plentiful. Computers almost work, sometimes. And electronic musicians are beginning to look to other forms of music for sources of sound and inspiration, resulting in some pretty goddamned excellent stuff. Electronic music has always had many pitfalls-- a reliance on trite drum machine programming, a propensity for being gratuitously grating and ""difficult,"" and the occasional lapse into weak retro fetishism. But when dealing almost entirely with generated sounds, one is afforded a certain freedom to manipulate sound as a whole entity. Rather than, ""Hey, let's move that chorus back to before the second verse and put a phaser on the guitar,"" an electronic musician could say, ""Hey, let's chop that chorus up into little pieces, run it through a phaser, reassemble it in a random pattern, and then turn that pattern into a pitched sample."" Increasingly, it seems that this kind of freedom to experiment is being utilized by electronic artists daring to venture outside the realm of what is traditionally seen as electronic territory. Max Tundra's amazing Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be utilized more rock-oriented instruments and songwriting mechanisms, coupled with a freedom to experiment with sound as a whole that's characteristic of the more evolved members of the sequencer set. Mouse on Mars's brilliant Idiology incorporated elements of prog and classical music into the band's warm electronic soundscapes, resulting in the most gorgeous arrangements of 1's and 0's I've heard this year. ""My Red Hot Car"" is, at its very core, a traditional pop song. It's got a memorable hook, accompanied by memorable lyrics: ""I'm gonna fuck you with my red hot car."" It's got a fairly straightforward chord structure, with smooth synthesizers and drum machines providing backing for the aforementioned computer-intoned melody. But Squarepusher's Tom Jenkinson is not the kind of guy to let a piece of music stagnate, no matter how good it is. What makes ""My Red Hot Car"" such a great single is the fact that Jenkinson manages to masterfully balance skittering electronic noodling with straight-up pop. This EP contains two versions of ""My Red Hot Car,"" the frenetic, fractured album version, and a smoother version, in which the pop hooks of the song remain largely unaltered. Both versions of the song are quite good, but the album cut, which actually appears second on this EP, is thoroughly attention-grabbing. In this more highly manipulated version, Jenkinson uses the song itself as a percussive instrument, dicing it into rhythmic pieces as the song progresses with its own complex rhythms. What's perhaps more impressive is that Jenkinson accomplishes this without making the track any less listenable than its more dancefloor-friendly counterpart. The remaining two tracks on My Red Hot Car provide a nice counterpoint to the hyperactive pop of the title tracks. ""Hardcore Obelisk"" is an exercise in pure subtlety-- no pounding rhythm, no computerized vocals, just a series of synthesized notes morphing subtly in and out of various tonalities. Granted, it's not the most thrilling listen, but it's remarkably well-executed, and provides a pleasant slowdown after the non-stop thrills of ""My Red Hot Car."" The final track, ""I Wish You Obelisk,"" bears a closer resemblance to straight-up drill-n-bass than anything else here-- it's a fine track, but seems dull in comparison to the sonic extremes of the other tracks. As a bonus, Jenkinson tosses in a moody ambient track to round things out-- perhaps a quieter variation on ""Hardcore Obelisk""-- though you have to fast-forward past 20 minutes of silence for it. Frankly, I can't be arsed to put in that kind of effort for every listen. I don't usually get excited about singles, but I'll be damned if ""My Red Hot Car"" hasn't staked out permanent real estate in my musical memory-- perhaps the first time a pop song so complex and spazzy has done so. Ah, well. If my brain gives out, I can always have my body frozen, to be gazed upon by the awestruck masses of the future. A fine time to be alive, indeed.","You know, this is a pretty good time to be alive. We're at least a generation past a major ...

Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks EP,The Rapture,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a213b1335d7bf16983ef/1:1/w_160/5ed8b6c5.gif,2001-05-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6692-out-of-the-races-and-onto-the-tracks-ep/,Sub Pop,"Yeah, I know what they're talking about. Isn't it obvious? Okay, so those arrows scrawled on the record cover's juvenile map of the U.S. could be converging on any number of major metropolitan areas, historical landmarks, Denny's restaurants, etc. Just listen to the music, though, and you'll agree that this isn't about DC, NYC, Gettysburg, Amish country, or any of that crap. This is pure New Jersey. Ignore for a moment the fact that the Rapture are from New York. What's New Jersey, anyway, if not the cracked and smeared reflection of the Empire State-- the Evil Twin NYC keeps chained in the basement? Whenever New York walks into the room, New Jersey crawls out from behind the radiator, croaking its truncated, mocking call of ""Newark!,"" and it scares the shit out of those Soho snobs every time. The mixture of hatred and odd admiration in my description has probably already tuned you into the fact that I'm from Jersey. Maybe that's why I like it when the Rapture come on like Manhattan proto-punk scenesters Television buried up to their necks in a toxic waste dump. The title track of ""Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks"" finds guitarist Luke Jenner slowly easing his tangled guitar riffs into Matty Safer's thick bassline stew until Vito Roccoforte's disco-shambling drums bring the song to a boil. These guys are both extremely tight and menacingly unhinged at the same time, thanks in no small part to the vocals. Handled here and throughout the album by Jenner and Safer, the high, nasal reports of ""Punishment in Higher Places"" sound like Tom Verlaine's cries for help as he struggles to keep his head above the muck. The Rapture manage to carve out an interesting niche for themselves in the aggro-punk/noise-rock fringe by capitalizing on their uncanny ability to groove in what would seem like the most inhospitable and abrasive environments. Safer and Roccoforte are a fantastic rhythm combo, swerving through the convoluted song structures in perfect sync and usually keeping Jenner's flightier guitar tethered. As Jenner slashes and swipes wildly against the rhythm in ""Modern Romance,"" for instance, Safer and Roccoforte hold their ground, grinding out an insistent, fluid, cymbal-heavy pulse. Below the trebly feedback fever-dream of ""The Jam,"" the beat warps and stretches into impossibly strange configurations without ever losing its way. Between the skin-thumping swagger at the song's close, you can barely make out the ringing of church bells, an effect so eerily submerged that it's hard to tell whether it belongs to the realm of happy recording accidents or found-sound genius. Unfortunately, the vocals tend to slip through the band's tightly-laced fingers every once in a while. The sparse ""Caravan"" breaks down into stretches of near-nothingness, leaving only the thin, whiny vocals to crack their way unsteadily through the melody. ""The Pop Song"" delivers on its weirdly upbeat instrumental sections, only to fall flat with a strained fantasy-metal sort of yelping that would be better off toasting the Bravery of the Elf King than attempting these unintelligible lyrics. The rhythm takes over again (thank God) for the last track, ""Confrontation,"" and neither the spiraling, metallic guitar nor the admittedly more palatable vocal exhortations can do anything to stop it. Roccoforte churns out an endless stream of cymbals and snares while Safer counterbalances with a rock-steady motorik throb. Soon, the song crashes to a near-halt before Roccoforte takes over again, leading off into the distance with a strangely serene rhythmic outro. Jersey, of course, isn't all ugly. It's almost like New York sometimes. Likewise, New Jersey is what New York is always on the verge of becoming. Hundreds of thousands of Jerseyites stream in to the city every day, becoming part of the place for eight hours before shuttling back across the borderline. With a sound in constant, uneasy flux, the Rapture speaks (not always eloquently, but effectively) for the commuter-- the ordinary-looking joe capable of blending into the Broadway crowds but forever holding a dirty secret in his irradiated little heart.","Yeah, I know what they're talking about.

Exciter,Depeche Mode,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b967ea9e61561daa6fa7/1:1/w_160/ef8ff970.gif,2001-05-15 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2283-exciter/,Warner Bros.,"Fashion is one of those things I'll just never understand. From Old Navy revisions of 70's clothing fads to icy, haute couture boutiques in upscale malls pushing $800 Chanel pocketbooks, it all seems a bit pointless; our culture's rabid materialism and hunger for the next big thing ensures style shifts every several months. Depeche Mode are no strangers to fashion-- it's in their name. Over the course of 14 albums, they've often favored style over substance, occasionally stopping to strike an emotional chord along the way. But no one could accuse them of changing with musical fads and trends. If anything, they've remained more consistent in twenty years than almost any of their contemporaries. And now, in the age of the beat, they've even toned down the dance rhythms that powered their earlier work in favor of a more abstract direction, albeit one that still screams Depeche Mode. It's taken Martin Gore, Dave Gahan, and Andrew Fletcher four years to follow up 1997's Ultra, but even with Björk producer Mark Bell on board, calling their new opus Exciter is kind of overstating it. From a production standpoint, the record sounds great, but at its core, it comes up empty, lacking a solid foundation of good songs to rest its adventurous studio trickery upon. Longtime fans will still find a lot to like here: ""Dream On"" tempers rolling acoustic guitars with a bed of twitching, programmed beats and fractured synth samples, and Dave Gahan's rich, unaffected vocals. Even with a new sonic direction, the song feels like classic Depeche Mode, and would sit nicely alongside most of the material on their greatest hits compilations. ""I Am You"" is another standout, diving headlong into uncharted territory with some truly bizarre, high-pitched synth squeals surfacing in the chorus. This background serves to unsettle an otherwise comfortable environment, and its juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness is in tune with the Rephlex aesthetic. Mark Bell's deft touch lends every moment of Exciter a certain glow of invention, but it's not all brilliant by any means. Every pretty girl gets something stuck in her teeth eventually, and these lyrics are a giant hunk of dark green spinach wedged between the incisors. The boys heap on enough lyrical dross to kill a high school goth. To view some of the most egregious offenses, let's briefly visit the Martin GORE Shop of Lyrical Horrors: From ""Shine"": ""Put on your blindfold and a dress that's tight/ And come with me on a mystery night.../ Somebody has to shine for me/ It's difficult not to shine for me."" >From ""The Dead of Night"": ""We're the horniest boys/ With the corniest ploys/ Who take the easiest girls/ To our sleaziest worlds.../ We are the dead of night/ We're in the zombie room/ We're twilight's parasites/ With self-inflicted wounds."" From ""Freelove"": ""Hey girl/ You've got to take this moment/ Then let it slip away/ Let go of complicated feelings/ There's no price to pay.../ And I'm only here/ To bring you free love/ Let's make it clear/ That this is free love."" A visit like this could last a lot longer, but it would probably get pretty dull. Unfortunately, boredom is a prevailing mood when listening to the whole of Exciter. The first few times through, it's hard to stay invested past the fifth track, ""The Dead of Night."" The two instrumental interludes, ""Lovetheme"" and ""Easy Tiger,"" are both rather unnecessary padding, and ""Breathe,"" with its string of Biblical references, simply plods. ""I Feel Loved"" is the only track that appears to be aimed toward a dancefloor, though it plays more like the 5:00am comedown song the DJ spins to get you to leave. The somewhat conventional ballad ""Goodnight Lovers"" brings the album to a reasonably engaging close with its warm synth patches and familiar chord progressions, but its lyrics concerning ""soul sisters and soul brothers"" feel forced. Depeche Mode and Mark Bell deserve a lot of credit for constructing the album's sounds from scratch, avoiding factory presets and rarely using the same sound combinations twice. The band should also be lauded for sticking to their guns after twenty years of falling in and out of fashion. But despite the amazing range of sounds they've conjured, Exciter ultimately fails to interest. Too much of it drifts by unnoticed, and the songs themselves often form around a vacuous core of trite lyrical conceits. It's the most frustrating type of album there is-- one that's full of promise and shining moments, but never fully delivers. Add to this the fact that those shining moments stand out like volcanoes in Nebraska, and you get something that the fans should own, and the neophytes should steer clear of.","Fashion is one of those things I'll just never understand.

Lateralus,Tool,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7da13d1975652139500/1:1/w_160/f91bdd80.jpg,2001-05-15 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8104-lateralus/,Volcano,"Eric Partridge's Dictionary of the Underworld (1998 NTC/Contemporary Publishing), a lexicon of 19th Century street slang, defines the idiom ""pitch the fork"" as ""to tell a pitiful tale."" The term appeared printed in 1863 in Story of a Lancashire Thief: ""Brummagem Joe, a cove [""fellow"" or ""dude,"" if you will] as could patter or pitch the fork with anyone."" At last, the secret motivation of my schtick and the etymology behind our name can be revealed. These reviews have been less critique than loquacious concept reviews by an entertaining tramp. So you'd think an 80-minute opus by Tool would be right up our alley. You'd be wrong. Undertow, Tool's 1993 debut LP, took studio skill and over-trained chops to metal with aplomb. It was Rush Sabbath. As emotional, melodic metal goes (the cultural impact of which will be left to the reader), it opened doors for bands like the Deftones, and to some degree, Limp Bizkit. However, Tool have always possessed a latent understanding of absurdity and comedy; their videos look like Tim Burton stop-motion, goth Primus. But with popularity and praise, Tool's shadowy tongue-in-cheek turned into the simple biting of tongues. \xC6nema spiced their sound with electronics and industry, as was the trend at the time. Now, with the early new century demanding ""opuses,"" Tool follows suit. The problem is, Tool defines ""opus"" as taking their ""defining element"" (wanking sludge) and stretching it out to the maximum digital capacity of a compact disc. Dictionary of the Underworld also offers several definitions for ""tool,"" including: ""a small boy used to creep through windows,"" ""to steal from women's pockets,"" and ""to loaf, to idle, to do nothing in particular."" All of which oddly strike the nail on the head in relation to Lateralus. And now, the obligatory pitching of the fork. My Summer Vacation, by Crispin Fubert, Ms. Higgins' Eng. Comp. 901 I believe that music comes and goes in cycles, and some of us are lucky enough to ride the crests. The men in my family are perfect examples of this. Initially, I thought that perfect music appeared every 16 years, which is also the number of years between Fubert generations. My dad was born in 1971. In that year, landmark albums were released. They were Nursery Crime by Genesis (the first with Phil Collins), Yes Album by Yes, Aqualung by Jethro Tull, and In the Land of Grey and Pink by Caravan. My grandfather skipped out on Vietnam-- because Jimi Hendrix himself told him to-- and he moved to Canterbury, which is in the United England. There, he got married to my grandmother, who used to sell baked goods to people at concerts, and they had my dad. After the war, they moved back with a box of awesome records like the ones I mentioned. I think it was cosmic or fate or something that my dad was born the same exact day Chrysalis released Aqualung, in March of 1971. Jump ahead 16 years later and my dad got this girl pregnant, who turned out to be my mom. It was 1987 and a whole bunch of lame dance music was ruling the world, like Hitler or Jesus or something. But all of the sudden, albums like Metallica's ...And Justice for All, Celtic Frost's Into the Pandemonium, Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, and Slayer's South of Heaven came out. That's when I was born. All those records were sitting around the house we all live in, and I grew up listening to them in the basement. So I couldn't wait until I was 16, because fate says that would be when 1) more kickass records would come out, and 2) I'd get sex. Both were due, because girls are dumb and listen to stuff like N'S(t)ync and BBSuk. But after this summer of 2001, I've had to rethink my entire cycle theory, like maybe the cycles of music are speeding as time goes forward, since two amazing things happened: Tool put out Lateralus and I saw Tool in concert. I feel like this record was made just for me by super-smart aliens or something, because it's just like a cross of 1971 and 1987. Imagine, like, Peter Gabriel with batwings or a flower on his head singing while Lars Ulrich and Rick Wakeman just hammer it down. It's the best Tool record because it's the longest. All summer I worked at Gadzooks, folding novelty t-shirts, and on each break, I would listen to Lateralus because the store just plays hip-hop and dance. My manager would always get on me for taking my breaks 20 minutes too long, but that's how long the album is and it just sucks you in. It's like this big desert world with mountains of riffs, and drum thunderstorms just roll across the sky. The packaging is also cool, since it has this clear book with a skinless guy, and as you turn the pages, it rips off his muscles and stuff. Tool's music does the same thing. It can just rip the muscles and skin off you. I think that's what they meant. So my manager would be like, ""Hey, there's a new box of 'Blunt Simpson' shirts I need you to put out and the 'Original Jackass' shelf is getting low."" He's a vegan and I would buy him Orange Julius because he didn't know there's egg powder in there. The first song is called ""The Grudge,"" and it's about astrology and how people control stuff. Maynard sings like a robot or clone at the opening, spitting, ""Wear the crutch like a crown/ Calculate what we will/ Will not tolerate/ Desperate to control/ All and everything."" Tool know about space and math, and it's pretty complex. ""Saturn ascends/ Not one but ten,"" he sings. No Doubt and R.E.M. sang out that, too, but those songs were wimpy and short. Maynard shows his intelligence with raw stats. I think there's meaning behind those numbers, like calculus. He also mentions ""prison cell"" and ""tear it down"" and ""controlling"" and ""sinking deeper,"" which all symbolize how he feels. Seven minutes into the song, he does this awesome scream for 24 seconds straight, which is like the longest scream I've ever heard. Then at the end there's this part where Danny Carey hits every drum he has. This wall of drums just pounds you. Then the next song starts and it's quiet and trippy. Tool are the best metal band, since they can get trippy (almost pretty, but in a dark way) then just really loud. Most bands just do loud, so Tool is more prog. Danny Carey is the best drummer in rock, dispute that and I know you are a dunce. I made a list of all of his gear (from the June issue of Modern Drummer): Drums, Sonor Designer Series (bubinga wood): 8x14 snare (bronze), 8x8 tom, 10x10 tom, 16x14 tom, 18x16 floor tom, two 18x24 bass drums. Cymbals, Paiste: 14"" Sound Edge Dry Crisp hi-hats, 6"" signature bell over 8"" signature bell, 10"" signature splash, 24"" 2002 China, 18"" signature full crash, #3 cup chime over #1 cup chime, 18"" signature power crash, 12"" signature Micro-Hat, 22"" signature Dry Heavy ride, 22"" signature Thin China, 20"" signature Power crash. Electronics: Simmons SDX pads, Korg Wave Drum, Roland MC-505, Oberheim TVS. Hardware: Sonor stands, Sonor, Axis or Pro-Mark hi-hat stand, Axis or Pearl bass drum petals with Sonor or Pearl beaters (loose string tension, but with long throw). Heads: Evans Power Center on snare batter (medium high tuning, no muffling), G2s on tom batters with G1s underneath (medium tuning with bottom head higher than batter), EQ3 bass drum batter with EQ3 resonant on front (medium tuning, with EQ pad touching front and back heads). Sticks: Trueline Danny Carey model (wood tip). He has his own sticks, even. In ""Schism,"" the double basses just go nuts at the end. They also do in ""Eon Blue Apocalypse."" And in ""The Grudge."" And in ""Ticks & Leeches."" And nobody uses more toms in metal. You can really hear the 8x8 and 10x10 toms in the opening for ""Ticks & Leeches."" Over the summer, I counted the number of tom hits in that song, and it's 1,023!! Amazing. That's my favorite song, since it's the one that starts with Maynard screaming, ""Suck it!"" Then he says, ""Little parasite."" Later he shouts, ""This is what you wanted... I hope you choke on it!"" Every time I watched my boss suck down those Orange Juliuses I had that stuck in my head. There is simply no way you could just dismiss the music (which is excellent). The bass playing is just really creepy and slow and sometimes it has this watery effect. Tool even follow in the footsteps of Caravan with Middle Eastern or Asian or something sounds. ""Disposition"" features bongos, and then on the next song, ""Reflection,"" Carey's toms sound like bongos or tablas or whatever is in those Fruitopia commercials. Close your eyes and imagine if Asia had a space program. This is like the music they'd play. The song is called ""Reflection"" since it's quieter and slower and sounds like it's from India, where people go to reflect. Maynard's voice sounds like that little bleached midget girl flying around inside the walls in Polterghost. It's messed up. In conclusion, there is more emotion on that album than would be on 30 Weezer albums. At the very least, there's 2.5 times as much. Like I said, it's messed up, like the world, which makes it very real. I don't think I'm going to have a kid this year, but that's also a good thing. Just imagine the Tool record that will come out in three years, according to my theory. It will be the future, and albums can be like longer with better compression and technology. Even as amazing as Lateralus is, I feel like there's a monster coming in three years. Music comes in cycles, and works on math, and my life and Tool are proof of that for sure.","Eric Partridge's Dictionary of the Underworld (1998 NTC/Contemporary\n\ Publishing), a lexicon of 19th Century street slang, defines ...

Open,Cowboy Junkies,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a689ea9e61561daa53b7/1:1/w_160/1ebf6265.gif,2001-05-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1640-open/,ZoeRounderZoeRounder,"Folks, this is the way to continue a career. Cowboy Junkies' star was at its highest arc sometime around the time of Natural Born Killers, when they mixed easily on a major label soundtrack to a major motion picture. They weren't hugely popular by any stretch, but they sold well enough to stay on RCA and then move to Geffen. Perhaps sales took a downturn, because Geffen dropped the band in 1999 as part of their post-merger housecleaning. Instead of crying about it (why do bands act like they're the only people ever fired?) they began releasing records on their own Latent label in 1999. Most bands would pack it in after a year or so of trying to do things on their own, but Cowboy Junkies continue to release beautifully packaged and artistically vital records under the mainstream radar. Something should be said about how prescient The Trinity Sessions album was. Here's an album from 1988 that tapped into the amber atmosphere of classic country and realized its connection to streetwise rock writing, in addition to foreshadowing the move toward glacial tempos. No wonder I couldn't stop playing that damn thing in my dorm room every time I slept through class. And in the thirteen years since, Cowboy Junkies have refined and diversified their sound, while remaining true to its rootsy core. Open shows as many sides to the band as I've heard on a single release. The sound throughout is simple and traditional, mostly guitars with organ and piano accents. There's a bit more edge to the guitars than before, but Michael Timmins wisely draws heavily from blues and soundtracks when deciding to process his electric. The wavering riff that echoes through the opener, ""I Did It All for You,"" is the perfect accompaniment, adding cinematic tension to the slowly unfolding tale of murder and betrayal. This is the sound thick with atmosphere that made the band famous, with the dimmer control twisted down a half-turn. The nearly eight-minute ""Dragging Hooks"" follows (the perfect song for nighttime driving), upping the tempo while adding swirls of slide guitar and feedback. But while there are a number of relatively snarling rockers, ballads will always be where Cowboy Junkies shine brightest. The prettiest of the bunch is ""Thousand Year Prayer,"" with gently brushed cymbals, simple guitar chords and restrained piano. The lyric is odd, at one point seeming to posit Jimi Hendrix as a possible martyr for the environmental movement, but with Margo Timmins in soft n' wet mode, I find it easy to cruise along on the pristine surface of the song. ""Beneath the Gate"" also finds Margo harmonizing with herself to great effect on a folky mid-tempo number that recalls John Prine. Some of the energetic tracks do little for me, particularly when the ""sincere roots rock"" angle reminds me of Melissa Etheridge, but overall Open is very solid. Long time fans will undoubtedly be delighted, but it's tough to predict if this record will inspire converts. I'm not sure exactly where Cowboy Junkies fit in these days, but if you've dismissed them in the past, I'd say they deserve another listen.","Folks, this is the way to continue a career.

The Cold Vein,Cannibal Ox,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50cb1335d7bf1698ae4/1:1/w_160/2dc1a344.jpg,2001-05-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1284-the-cold-vein/,Definitive Jux,"I rented the film Ravenous last weekend. I'm not going to mention any spoilers, but it told a good tale. The transition from period-piece to straight-up action flick was disappointing, though, because I liked the occasional attempts to address the historical context. Soon after one character talks about the relentless American drive for westward expansion in the 19th century, a stereotypical chase scene occurs, as a merry banjo instrumental plays in the background. I couldn't figure out what they were trying to achieve-- each time the track popped up, it ruined an otherwise visceral clarity. Cannibal Ox don't have that problem with their debut LP on Def Jux Records, The Cold Vein. ""Iron Galaxy,"" which originally appeared in 2000 on a split EP with Company Flow, begins the album. Vast Aire and Vordul rap an abstract refrain, ""My shell, mechanical found ghost/ But my ghetto is animal found toast,"" a taste of the tortured environment they document in their hometown New York City. Vordul grabs the mic and busts for 2\xBD minutes, beginning with the end of life and ending with a near-hopeless call for peace. Vast Aire then takes a microscope to the street, descending into prose so dense and depraved that the stomach lurches. I don't want to ruin the surprises lurking around every corner in this verse, but imagine the sonic background, served up by Company Flow CEO El-P, who's taken the duo underneath his wing and produced the album: looped beats remain discrete while UNKLE-like synth chords bubble upwards, colliding with an old-school video game sample that accelerates until the last few seconds of the song sound like a Richie Hawtin rave-up. ""Ox Out the Cage"" brings a more trad rap feel, complete with the ""I'd like to introduce... "" narrative. But both MC's strive to pronounce flows in incredible salvos, rarely using chorus lines. Prose is the game here, and Vordul deals in rapid-fire verses that skip every other break to rhyme with the next-- Wu-inspired, but who isn't? Vast prefers a slightly slower pace, all the better to fight the war in his brain between concrete detail and mastermind abstraction. He delivers verses with a rising inflection that recalls RBX's self-impressed swagger, but this doesn't distract from lines like, ""I grab the mic like Are You Experienced/ But I don't play the guitar, I play my cadence."" Power chords accent the mix, but this ain't some crossover cock-rock revival. The rhythm here is aggressive; it turns caddy-slacking P-funk samples into hors d'oeuvres, shoves aside all those Jeep-ish Timbaland hi-hats and snare drums and devours the RZA's sinister string lines. The Cold Vein is like a musical negative, an inverse reflection of hip-hop history, full of everything DJ's cast aside, from Sega sound effects to electro-industrialism, gear-work grooves malfunctioning, synthesizers belching, a menagerie of digitalia. The group has more facets than their brutality, though. Don't flinch when ""Battle for Asgard"" betrays its epic title by breaking up each verse with an interlude that sounds like circus music. There's room for humorous self-criticism in this relentless debut, but it works best in ""Raspberry Fields,"" where Vast Aire cuts his flow short with, ""Oh shit, I said a word twice,"" and starts again from the beginning. Eventually, all but the most hardcore heads will appreciate a break from the intensity. Two of the best tracks on The Cold Vein ease up just enough to show some humanity beneath the tough skin. In ""A B-Boys Alpha,"" Vast Aire narrates a personal account of his life, from Freudian birthing trauma to the streets where ""my first fight was me versus five boroughs."" A booming choir of distortion wells in the background, strangely conjuring up reminiscence. ""The F-Word"" cools it down just enough to tell the story of a b-boy reluctant to fall in love; El-P keeps it real gritty with an urban melody that recalls Method Man's ""All I Need."" Ultimately, Cannibal Ox inherit the mantle of the Wu-Tang Clan: you can polish your rhetorical teeth endlessly, but when your appetite is for violence you stay mired in the muck you rose from. At times you can't tell whether they want to break conventions or heads, or whether it's an either/or proposition. But witness the transition from disgust to critique here: ""With beats that have to be registered as sex offenders before presented to the public/ I'll exfoliate your face with the acid inside my stomach/ Binge and purge/ We live in thirty-second blurbs/ And if consumers stop existing we forget how to use words/ Just fuckin' eat each other 'til the next ice age occurs. "" Here's to Cannibal Ox transcending the Wu's paranoid conspiracy theories and truly dropping critical science. But enough of the bullshit, The Cold Vein is going to be on everybody's year-end list of the best underground hip-hop. Consume it, just watch it doesn't consume you.","I rented the film Ravenous last weekend. I'm not going to mention any\n\ spoilers, but it told a ...

Reveal,R.E.M.,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24eb1335d7bf1698479/1:1/w_160/5d388192.jpg,2001-05-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6748-reveal/,Warner Bros.Warner Bros.,"On the scale of human accomplishments, turning out a classic album ought to rank up there with climbing Mount Everest. Stoned. With one leg. And no oxygen. Given the infinite potential for obnoxious excess within the Rock genre, it's no small feat to assemble an album that's so well phrased, so deftly stated, that its impact extends far beyond the realm of the audible. Turn out two or more such albums and you're headed for legendary status. Turn out five or six and you're R.E.M. One of the great things about R.E.M.'s musical history is how they've managed to retain a distinctive sound while releasing a series of sonically diverse albums. The wistful ruminations of Automatic for the People evoked images of the grandiose and darkly beautiful. New Adventures in Hi-Fi served as a companion piece to the barren yet oddly gorgeous landscape of the west. And despite all this change, R.E.M. has always remained R.E.M. The good news is that R.E.M. are still R.E.M. Every song on Reveal possesses that inimitable stylistic element present in all of their work to date. And in many ways, Reveal is a comforting listen. While it does rely more heavily on synthesized sounds than any of their past albums, the songs themselves bear a stronger resemblance to the archetypal R.E.M. song than anything post-Monster. What makes Reveal so disappointing is that the additions to the classic R.E.M. sound are all merely superficial. The increased reliance on burbling, jittering synthesizers actually makes the album a less engaging listen, turning many of its songs into messy sonic muddles. The band's better works demonstrated a certain aural economy-- each sound had a purpose; nothing was extraneous or unnecessary. But far too many of the effects on Reveal seem added to the songs as afterthoughts, and prevent the tracks from materializing into coherent, compelling pieces of music. This, however, is only part of a greater problem facing the album: most of the songs here simply don't go anywhere. A chord progression, a rhythm, a basic structure for the song is introduced. And oftentimes, that's it. Slight variations may factor in, but far too many of these tracks just sort of chug along, uninspired and drained of the energy that once made these guys so vital. Were this lack of variation coupled with wrenchingly beautiful melodies, it would be a lot easier to swallow. But as it stands, much of Reveal simply drifts by, failing to register emotionally or evoke the kind of rich, vivid imagery that earlier albums brimmed over with. Which is not to say that Reveal is entirely devoid of merit. ""The Lifting"" opens the album promisingly, with an undeniably great melody and an all-enveloping background of piano, strings, and synthesizers. But even this, one of Reveal's better tracks, can't escape from some of the record's pitfalls (most notably mind-numbing repetitiveness). Its first single, ""Imitation of Life,"" bears a strong resemblance to the painfully awkward ""The Great Beyond"" single from the Man on the Moon soundtrack. But it makes up for terrible lyrics by providing two things that Reveal lacks as a whole: a catchy hook, and a sufficient degree of sonic variety. It's certainly not a perfect song, but when held up against the browns and grays of the rest of the album, it provides a welcome glimmer of sunshine. In a documentary about the making of R.E.M.'s last album, Up, Michael Stipe spoke of ""moments of clarity,"" glimpses of the transcendental beauty and truth that he aims to convey in R.E.M.'s music. There are no such moments to be found on Reveal. The album is so muddled and repetitive that it's almost impossible to pick out any kind of individual moments within the album's framework. When I put on most R.E.M. albums and close my eyes, my mind is flooded with crystalline imagery, with miniature explosions, with the very moments of clarity that Stipe described; when I put on Reveal and close my eyes, I fall asleep.","On the scale of human accomplishments, turning out a classic album ought to rank up there with climbing Mount Everest ...

Weezer (Green Album),Weezer,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9ee13d1975652139948/1:1/w_160/db51e105.gif,2001-05-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/,Interscope,"I could fill an entire paragraph right now simply repeating the name Weezer. Oh, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer. Oh, Weezer. How sad I am for Weezer. Let's backtrack. This requires a lot of personal history to be revealed-- total stream-of-consciousness memory recall. We'll start in 1994. In 1994, I was ten years old. Rock music was a new and relatively unknown concept to me. By rock music, I mean rock music: distorted guitars, hard-hitting drums, the harshness of grunge and rock. It had already broken onto mainstream radio, but I was too young to pay attention. I was a weird kid, busying myself with Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson records. The girl who lived next door (and who also happened to take care of me on occasion, when my parents were out) was probably around 12 or 13 at the time. I thought she was beautiful. It resembled a crush, although it probably wasn't. And occasionally, we would listen to CDs. She brought over her very small collection-- mine was already three times as large. There was a blue disc amongst her discs. She pulled it out and pressed play. My world was blasted apart. She clearly loved this, and I had no idea what to think. ""Undone (The Sweater Song)"" was her favorite. It was one of those rare 'brand new' experiences I'm lucky enough to be able to remember. Not long after, I obtained a copy of my own. It was my favorite album for a very long time. I ordered lyrics from the fan club through the mail. I memorized the handwritten words while listening to the album on repeat. ""My Name is Jonas"" was pure beauty, and ""Only in Dreams"" was pure power. It still is. Somehow, I didn't manage to pick up Pinkerton until 1999. I'd kind of forgotten about Weezer for a year or two, and then suddenly I remembered them. At first, I wasn't terribly impressed, clearly being more familiar with the sound of grunge and angst. And then I listened to it a second time and was knocked out all over again. I went back to ""the blue album,"" this time understanding the intricacies of the sound-- what makes the songs so warm and effective. Its simple brilliance slapped me; it sounded as fresh as it did the first time I ever heard it. So naturally, as news of Weezer recording began to circulate late last year, I was overjoyed. How would they follow-up the blistering, angry Pinkerton? And then, months later, Weezer released ""Hash Pipe."" It was on the radio one day a few weeks ago. I listened to it. I listened to the whole song, from beginning to end. And when it ended, I said no. I said no no no no no. No! Weezer! NO!! Where has Rivers Cuomo gone? What has he done? What has happened to Weezer?! WHERE ARE THE REAL WEEZER?!! My heart was broken. Really. This is going to sound like hyperbole, but I hated music at that moment. For just a moment, I lost faith completely. It was an overblown reaction, granted, but even after I realized how ridiculous I was being, I still felt a hatred. The song was abysmal, no two ways about it. It wasn't awkward. It wasn't charming. It didn't have dueling guitar solos with soaring and intricate harmonies. And what it wasn't made it what it was: stale, polished, emotionless. The new self-titled Weezer album, as it turns out, is average from beginning to end. There are maybe one or two decent melodies out of the ten songs here, and the only change in tone comes with ""Island in the Sun,"" the album's only truly enjoyable song and its catchiest hook. It's the first and only moment of even moderate pleasure in the record's brief yet far too long 28-minute length. But even with this singular change in volume and mood, Weezer lacks the sense of dynamics and intricacy that Pinkerton-- and especially their debut-- held in spades. There's no power to these songs, and even less depth. It's a de-evolution back through Pinkerton, through the blue album, and beyond. Like ""Hash Pipe,"" it doesn't seem genuine anymore. But The Green Album doesn't generally sound like the canned, artificial angst of ""Hash Pipe""; it has a sunny disposition, with songs like ""O Girlfriend"" and ""Glorious Day."" An actual line from the song ""Smile,"" for instance: ""Open up your heart and let the good stuff come out."" It's unoriginal, moronic and tacky, and that's all there is to it. Nothing under the surface. Disappointment. I was bitter. At Rivers, at Weezer, at Geffen and Interscope. This was one of my favorite bands. They were the only band whose fan club I have ever joined. They had significance. They opened musical doors for me. This album is not that Weezer. But I had to write a review, so I did a little research. And I read that, after the complete failure of the angst and emotional extremes of Pinkerton in the music world, Cuomo felt as if his goal to be a rockstar was completely obliterated. So he locked himself in his room for a year, with no outside contact, and when he came out, his work suddenly had no emotional content. He's now afraid that fans of the band will hate the new album and lose touch with him and the group. He genuinely realizes that all of the feeling in his vocals and lyrics are gone, and he realizes that it's probably a phase. And I suddenly share his fear. So maybe the real Weezer-- the Weezer I know and love-- can come back now. After this phase ends and the album goes platinum, maybe they'll feel better about themselves. I'm going to go upstairs now to listen to the album that is 1994 to me, the album that is still new and marvelous to me after seven years, and fall asleep content.","I could fill an entire paragraph right now simply repeating the name Weezer.

A Future Lived in Past Tense,Juno,by: Edward Howard,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3e5e6ef95969322b5a/1:1/w_160/886b7279.gif,2001-05-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4320-a-future-lived-in-past-tense/,DeSotoDeSoto,"Can you ever have too much good music? Ask Juno, and they'd certainly say no. After all, their new album, A Future Lived in Past Tense, is close to 70 minutes long, with quite a few tracks ranging between seven and ten minutes in length. There aren't many bands that can pull this off, but Juno proved on their 1999 debut, This is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes, that they're capable of crafting highly intriguing compositions over extended periods of time. That record was a masterpiece of soaring guitar rock, and not a note of it was wasted. But a few listens to this sophomore effort should give an indication of just how thin the line between ""trance-inducing"" and ""sleep-inducing"" can be. This isn't to say that the entirety of A Future Lived in Past Tense is boring; it's not, and fans of the first Juno album should find much to love here. Examples: after a keyboard-driven opening instrumental, the band kicks it into high gear with ""Covered with Hair,"" a whirlwind assault of the band's distinctive three-guitar sound with frontman Arlie Carstens' expressive, angstful vocals evening things out. ""Help is On the Way"" takes a slightly more laidback approach, with repetitive, twanging guitars and a steady, thumping punk beat. Juno have definitely calmed since their debut, as ""The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow"" will attest. A slow number with tinkling piano and a shuffled beat under the wintry atmosphere of hushed vocals and melodic guitars, it's easily one of the gentler track in the band's catalog. If the rest of the album sounded like this, it's doubtful anybody would complain about Juno's newfound quietude. However, ""The French Letter"" takes the sobriety to a new level, as the song takes nearly seven minutes to build to a climax. Shambling percussion and slow, strummed guitars plod lifelessly, obviously in no hurry to get anywhere. When the song finally gets around to exploding, the result is admittedly rousing. Still, the average American spends over five years of their life waiting in traffic; do we really need our music to replicate this experience? More successful is the 9+ minute ""We Slept in Rented Rooms,"" which features great lyrics like, ""We used each like axes/ To cut down the ones we really love."" Carstens' confessionals are layered over delicate, interweaving guitars and a complex beat, holding attention by incorporating just enough melodic shifts and yelled vocals to temporarily lift the somber mood. ""Things Gone and Things Still Here,"" on the other hand, is a long-winded spoken word narrative whose sparse musical backing remains almost completely static throughout its 8\xBD minute length. Carstens' creative lyrics imagine a close friend as she might be at the age of 73, reading over their old correspondence. But lyrical bright spots aside, the music here has little to recommend-- even the band's powerhouse guitars are absent. Fortunately, A Future Lived in Past Tense's last two proper songs, ""Killing It in a Quiet Way"" and ""You Are the Beautiful Conductor of This Orchestra"" (yeah, the titles are pretentious-- deal with it) pick up the pace with more of the blistering post-punk that made Juno's debut such a kick-ass record. As with many long albums, A Future could have benefited greatly from a shorter running time and some better sequencing-- for instance, any sequencing that didn't cram the three longest songs into tracks 6, 8, and 9. But regardless of these flaws, Juno delivers a fairly strong album, particularly the first half. The songs that manage to rock as hard as This is the Way's best moments uphold that record's legacy, even with bassist Travis Saunders supplanted by interim replacements Nick Harmer of Death Cab for Cutie and Nate Mendel of the Foo Fighters. The more solemn tracks... eh, they're mostly okay. So, to answer my own question, can you have too much good music? Definitely not; if Juno had delivered 70 minutes of quality along the lines of ""The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow"" or ""Help is on the Way,"" you wouldn't be putting up with my bitching right now. But can you have too much mediocre music? Yeah. Hell, yeah.","Can you ever have too much good music? Ask Juno, and they'd certainly say no.\n\ After all, their ...

Originally released in 1952, the three-volume set-- a fourth volume was added in 2000-- provides an awesome, sweeping perspective of the foundation of American music. Then, in 1999, came Moby's Play, which sampled Alan Lomax-era field blues; by 2000, the word ""ubiquity"" had become an understatement. And here in 2001, the soundtrack to the Coen brothers' southern romp through the Odyssey, O Brother Where Art Thou, has reached unlikely heights, peaking at #13 on the Billboard 200. I think it's safe to say that American roots music-- that is, pre-WWII country, blues, and folk, which were often indiscernible-- is more popular than it's been for at least 30 years, if not since the era of its creation. And it probably won't get any more popular than this. Smith's anthology is collecting dust in East Village apartments. O Brother, Where Art Thou has slipped out of the Top 20, albeit gracefully. And, alas, all 18 commercially licensed tracks from Moby's album are evaporating from our collective consciousness. (At last!) This minor boom helped lift some artists, like Emmylou Harris and Ramblin' Jack Elliott back into the spotlight. Still, there are countless more artists-- Eric Von Schmidt and Stefan Grossman, to name a couple-- who should've received attention for their old-time talents, but never did. But who would have thought, ten years ago, that the lead singer of the Screaming Trees would be one of the neglected? Mark Lanegan, the solo artist, has written music with his feet planted firmly in aged American soil. Over the course of four solo albums since 1990, his gritty blues, country and folk has become progressively more roots-oriented, not to mention more sophisticated. Lanegan's determination to hone his sound culminated with 1998's I'll Take Care of You, a covers album that ranged from Buck Owens- to Jeffrey Lee Pierce-penned songs, yet managed to unify all of them. Field Songs is, fortunately for us, more of the same, except that Lanegan's back to writing original material. This is sub-pop in the truest sense: it's music made in the pop/rock era with influences from before the era was even conceived. But his sonic palette has also widened. Just seconds into the opener, ""One Way Track,"" after the snare-heavy percussion and soft electric and acoustic guitars shuffle in, the ears are pricked by low-decibel dissonance: echoing guitar scratches like high-pitched thunder or machine-gun fire; a twinkling piano like rain on a corrugated tin roof; buzzing like a recalcitrant computer. But none of it invades the space needed for his husky voice and lines like, ""The stars and the moon aren't where they're supposed to be/ But a strange electric light falls so close to me."" The next track, ""No Easy Action,"" opens with female ahhh's before breaking into a whir- and acoustic-fueled tear through blues romps, gospel choirs, and rock psychedelics. As always, Lanegan's voice is as compellingly loud and high-pitched as it is low and smoky; but accompanied, as he is during this moment, by the almost tribal voices of the women, his music reaches an uplifting epiphany. And then there's the utterly different epiphany reached on ""Field Song,"" where soft, reverberated chords give way to nearly a minute of crashing guitars. But on most of these tracks, the touches are very subtle: rain in the background of the beautiful, understated instrumental, ""Blues for D""; distant guitars crackling like falling timbers on ""Fix""; buzzing tolls ringing over the hills on ""She's Done Too Much."" While these additions have prevented Lanegan from being straight-jacketed by his roots influences, as some fans and critics feared, those addicted to Lanegan's dark sound need not worry. When you distill Field Songs, what's left is the same haunted man singing folk, blues, and country numbers for the depressed and downtrodden. Even with deep, yet restrained atmospherics at work-- as on ""One Way Street""-- he's singing lines like, ""I drink so much sour whiskey, I can hardly see."" Furthermore, the majority of these tracks are still the full-sounding, yet bare-boned affairs that Lanegan has made his trademark. If any album is capable of delivering roots music's last gasp of popularity, Field Songs is it.","In 1997, nearly every critic in the country lauded Smithsonian/Folkways' re-release of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk ...

Identikit,Burning Airlines,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f69d034d5c69bf2f55/1:1/w_160/8347f51d.gif,2001-05-08 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1024-identikit/,DeSotoDeSoto,"Like a masochist in a meatpacking facility, I've just got to have my hooks. A song can rock as hard as Keith Moon drumming with dynamite sticks at the peak of a coke binge, but without a hook, what are you going to remember? ""Yeah, dude, it rocked."" But can you hum it? Can you pick up a guitar and clumsily finger the melody in a matter of seconds? No. No, you can't. Of course, we all need to rock out, too. Not paper, not scissors-- rock. I mean, hooks are all well and good, but limp pop can only go so far, no matter how catchy it is. What you need is that extra power chord, or maybe that unnecessary cymbal crash, to hammer it home. I've often had trouble reconciling these conflicting needs. Usually, the best I can do is stand in front of my CD player and rapidly alternate between hook-filled pop and balls-out rock 'n' roll. That, and listening to Burning Airlines' excellent debut album, Mission: Control! Not only did Mission: Control! rock as hard as anything J Robbins put out with Jawbox, it was crammed with unforgettable pop hooks the likes of which have rarely ever graced such a tight rock album. And oh, was the result potent. An album that was catchy enough to get stuck in your head, and rockin' enough to give you whiplash from the countless hours spent mentally replaying the album. At least, the jaw-dropping first half of it was. Aside from a few weak spots in the later innings, there was little fault to be found in Mission: Control! From a technical or purely instinctual point of view, it was a masterfully pulled-off affair. Sadly, such a perfect balance cannot be maintained forever. Ice caps melt, dodos become extinct, and rock overpowers the unsuspecting pop hook. Identikit, the Burning Airlines' second full-length, is certainly a fine rock record. But with only a few exceptions, it lacks the hooks to really pull you in. But to break from tradition, let's look at the exceptions rather than the rule. ""A Song with No Words,"" with its twisted, effects-laden guitar riffage, lively guitar/bass interplay, and compelling vocal melody, is Burning Airlines at their best. While several of the lyrics to ""A Song with No Words"" (yes, it has lyrics), could easily be considered typical love song fare, the slithery, off-putting guitar part and intricate bassline give the song some deliciously shifty undertones. ""Outside the Aviary,"" the album's opener, utilizes a more traditional means to achieve a similar result; it's a fiery, intense rock song held together by the interplay of three expert musicians. Sadly, though, even these songs aren't as instant as the standouts from Mission: Control! It seems that when Bill Barbot left the group, so did the memorable riffs. New bassist and songwriting collaborator Mike Harbin does contribute driving, fluid basslines, and a more dissonant edge, but often, the dissonance seems to accomplishing very little. When it's on the stereo, Identikit can be a vicious, intense listen. But unlike its predecessor, once the record ends, you're ready to move on.","Like a masochist in a meatpacking facility, I've just got to have my hooks. A song can rock as ...

Look into the Eyeball,David Byrne,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41d5e6ef959693207ce/1:1/w_160/f0f42e99.gif,2001-05-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1060-look-into-the-eyeball/,VirginLuaka BopVirginLuaka Bop,"Call me crazy, but it seems to me that David Byrne likes having friends. Or at least, he seems to have a lot of friends who like him. What makes me say this? Is it the lyrical content of Look into the Eyeball, Byrne's sixth solo record, that gives it away? Is it the joyous quality of his voice as he sings a Spanish duet with Nrü of Cafè Tacuba? Or is it the fact that exactly forty-nine (49) guest musicians are credited in the liner notes? If I were you, I'd probably go with the latter observation. I'm not sure if any solo album really warrants 49 people, but Byrne tries his damnedest to come up with good uses for all of them. First of all, he's David Byrne, the charismatic, iconic former frontman of one of the most influential bands of the last 25 years. It's hard to argue with the man. Secondly, even with his multitude of backup musicians, he's the only person that plays guitar. And third, 19 of the guests here play a string instrument. You probably don't need to read 19 names to figure out that much of Look into the Eyeball is coated with stringed accompaniment, often in the forefront. But this is no chamber music album. For the most part, it consists of upbeat, funk-laden pop songs, with lyrics that rarely penetrate past one's eyeball, but rhythms that bounce and shake for better or worse. It's a step back from the loose concept of Feelings; there are only a couple of feelings present here, and they either relate to the music or are extremely cryptic. Bittersweet melody has become one of Byrne's strongest songwriting suits over the past decade, and it isn't spared here. ""The Great Intoxicator"" refers to music as its namesake, with looped and organic Latin percussion providing a steady pulse as the dynamic strings aid Byrne in his graceful and melodic expression of the sentiment. Unexpectedly, though, some of the record's best moments come when Byrne strips away the rhythmic accessories and relies on basic orchestral backing, as with ""The Revolution,"" a gorgeous acoustic guitar-and-violin ballad that again uses music as part of its lyrical imagery. And yet, the majority of the album still relies on primal, swinging grooves. The obvious single, ""Like Humans Do,"" features nonsensical lyrics akin to Little Creatures-era Talking Heads about doing things, uh... like humans do. Such as ""achin',"" ""shakin',"" and ""breakin',"" as the chorus informs us. But as ridiculous as the lyrics get, Byrne's melody is undeniably infectious, and his rhythm will no doubt get some appendage of yours tapping. The song also stands as the best example of the album's use of strings and horns for texture-- an entire orchestra seems to sit in the back of this backyard jam session, and it seems perfectly in place. ""Broken Things"" is Eyeball's musical peak, though, as the raw global funk aesthetic that pervaded his 1994 self-titled record comes back into play. The violins wisely sit this one out. After ""Descondido Soy,"" the aforementioned Spanish-language duet with Nrü, the album slumps-- specifically with ""Neighborhood,"" a coy, 70's lite-funk tune employing an innumerable amount of clichéd disco aesthetics. Despite this misstep, though, Byrne gets back on his feet with a few more tunes that, while never truly living up to the Eyeball's first half, wring out the kind of rhythmic and melodic glee only Byrne can pull off. Maybe that's why so many pals flocked to play with him; he still has a lot of fun in the studio.","Call me crazy, but it seems to me that David Byrne likes having friends.

Judge Rock: Good afternoon. Style seeks separation from Substance. Style, on what grounds do you seek separation? Style: Well, Your Honor, Substance is holding me back. I believe that I can function better without his restrictions and demands, and that I'm capable of surviving on my own. Judge Rock: Do you have any evidence to support your claim? Style: Yes, Your Honor. The plaintiff presents Cousteau's eponymous debut album as evidence that I can indeed prevail without the presence of Substance. Judge Rock: And, Substance, what do you say in your defense? Substance: Your Honor, it is indeed possible for Style to exist without me, but the products that arise from it will be of generally low quality and unsatisfying. They may seem cool at first, but when you dig into them, you'll be missing my contributions, which would make the music worth revisiting. Judge Rock: And do you have evidence to support your claim? Substance: The defense wishes also to submit Cousteau's eponymous debut album. Judge Rock: Uh, you're both presenting the same evidence? Substance: I suppose we are. Judge Rock: I don't know if that's legal or not, but I'm willing to allow it so I can get the hell out of here and have a drink. The Court will now hear the arguments. Style, make it snappy. Style: Well, I'd like to draw your attention to Exhibit A, the album cover. The black-and-white photo of the band members playing in some anonymous barroom basement is really cool-looking. One glance at that and you know you're in for quality hipster jazz-rock. Substance: That's true, Your Honor, but take into account that there's really nothing all that jazzy about this music-- unless you're one of those people who thinks that having a flugelhorn player in the band is ""jazzy""-- and what do you have? It's not really false advertising, but it's close. Style: Well, jazziness aside, they do look pretty hip. Moving on from the artwork to the music, though, you'll find some fantastic nighttime sounds. It shares a certain affinity with latter-day mope-rockers like Tindersticks, but it isn't mopey all the time. It's great music for enhancing the mood of a given room. Can't you just picture people getting laid to ""The Last Good Day of the Year?"" And ""Jump in the River"" is a great gospel-inflected tune painted in shades of midnight blue. Substance: Oh, give me a break. You make it sound like something some disinterested music critic would write. Truthfully, it's a decent song, and it sure is moody, but at its core, vocalist Liam McKahey isn't given much to sing. It's a cliched bit about a late night tryst. The printed lyrics even feature the inane homonym, ""And so long may she reign/ (So long may she rain)."" Songwriter Davey Ray Moor may be a passable multi-instrumentalist, but as a lyricist, he never veers from the beaten paths. ""Mesmer"" even uses the phrase, ""Where angels fear to tread!"" Judge Rock: Indeed, very poor judgment on Style's behalf. Bryan Adams and the Spin Doctors even have songs with this phrase as the title, and I ruled in favor of Substance in both of those cases. Substance: And as for the music, it's just bland acoustic rock that builds on a blueprint laid out by Scott Walker's first four albums. It all blends nicely, but for me personally, it's proven very difficult to discern one song from another. They're all decent enough on their own, but it's pretty indistinct stuff. In its favor, there are some accomplished solos, but all the violins, guitars, pianos and basses ultimately just mosey along over loungy percussion. ""She Don't Hear Your Prayer"" is basically soft rock, opening with that most hackneyed of effects: the wind chime. Style: But there is a song called ""Shades of Ruinous Blue."" Any Pier One consultant will tell you that shades of ruinous blue are very fashionable this season. Substance: Hey, we're talking about me, here. Judge Rock: Okay, I've heard enough. Give me the album. We'll take a 50 minute and 37 second break and I'll be back with my verdict. [Later] Bailiff: The honorable Judge Rock, all rise. Judge Rock: Thank you, you may be seated. I have decided for the defense. Substance is too important for Style to ever function at its maximum potential without it. Cousteau may be a great album for the late-night hours, but I doubt I'd want to wake up with it. Therefore, I'm ordering that Style never be more than the length of a given recording from Substance at all times from this point forward. Any artist found in violation may be stripped of their dignity, and sentenced to life in obscurity. The court is adjourned.","Bailiff: The Court will now hear the case of Style vs. Substance, the Honorable Judge Rock Presiding.

How Can Any Thing So Little Be Any More EP,Joan of Arc,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba089d034d5c69bf5370/1:1/w_160/f71752d7.gif,2001-04-30 05:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4269-how-can-any-thing-so-little-be-any-more-ep/,Jade Tree,"After four years of experimentation, Tim Kinsella killed Joan of Arc. In hindsight, Milla Jovovich filled the role better. He's clapped the laptop shut and hit CRTL-Q in ProTools. Currently, Kinsella(s? Are we still doing the 's'?) fronts the Owls with a reunited Cap'n Jazz line-up. Their upcoming Steve Albini-produced debut is stripped-down, guitars/bass/drums Chicago emo, pretty much picking up where Cap'n Jazz, Ghosts and Vodka, and American Football left off. In other words, Tim Kinsella either missed the point or desperately wants those teen fans back. Forever dreaming of a Drag City membership, Kinsella gradually moved from rock tunes with subtle electronic flourishes like ""White Out"", ""The Hands"", and ""God Bless America"" into illegitimate Bastrd del Sol cut-and-pasting-- and all while failing miserably, save for one or two standouts per album. Yes, somewhere in Joan of Arc's four-album career lies enough solid material to piece together one quality LP. Tracks like ""Me (Plural)"" with Jen Wood, ""Who's Afraid of Elizabeth Taylor"", ""Me + America (or) The United Colors of the Gap"", and ""How Wheeling Feels"" will make the inevitable Jade Tree hits collection a purchase to consider. So, taking into account Joan of Arc's inability to fill an entire album with intrigue, a posthumous EP seems potentially agreeable. Until we learn that this is a wastebin of The Gap leftovers. Technically more diverse than anything else Joan of Arc has released, How Can Any Thing So Little Be Any More at times molests ears more brutally than ever before. One song, ""Most at Home in Motels"", succeeds as a brief, improved summation of the direction on The Gap. Erratic acoustic guitars pick and slide over digital scribbles and potato-chip drumming. A novice piano and insectoid noise flutter through the second half, and for a moment, Kinsella seems ahead of the curve. Otherwise, the EP plummets into realms of inconceivably horrendous lyrics and fuck-off music. ""Ne Mosquitos Pass"" offers delicate music overshadowed by a shit-blimp vocal performance. Kinsella rambles lines like, ""Toilet brush and icebucket/ Where are you now/ How long is your hair/ There's a couch in the back of my work you can sleep on,"" then shouts, ""Fucking strangers feels better feels better fucking strangers,"" over and over before the climax: ""Big gay Mr. T knocked the fucking teeth out with a telephone!"" Someone should be reading the labels on their prescription bottles. The short instrumental ""My Fight Is Necessary"" shows Kinsella flirting with Metal Machine Music drones, sliding whistles, and reversed guitar to no acceptable result. A solitary guitar whimpers, tucks its tail between its legs, and tries to hide behind Kinsella's naked, saggy voice on ""My Cause Is Noble and Just"". The sluggish, country-tinged ballad ""What If We Are Not After All, All Destined for Greatness"" has Kinsella dueting with some poetic barista guy and admitting to his recording practices: ""I'm singing this in my friend's kitchen."" Thanks for the effort. Worst of all are the trio of children's songs. Not songs for children, mind you, but songs sung by children. A lone toddler croons, unaccompanied, into a tape recorder on ""We Neither Hide Nor Seek"": ""I never wanted I never wanted to touch you... DADDY!... the way I wanted to feel to you. I love the way of your daylight I love you sweetheart."" This sounds illegal in 49 states. The kid also pops up briefly on the next pointless instrumental before taking the mic with a little buddy on ""I'll Show You, I'll Show You All"". The song opens with echoing emo (echmo?) repetition, then disappears to let the kids sing, ""I love you Jesus do do do do do"", a sentiment with which the Christian Coalition might begin to disagree. Ol' INRI gets more props in the next track with the opening line of, ""Jesus really was so/ Goddam pretentious."" Kinsella sounds jealous. And relating to the topic of Mr. H. Christ, Kinsella mumbles, ""Blessed be we amateurs,"" earlier in the EP. After a silly career of bumbling art, that's a lost sermon-on-the-mount beatitude Kinsella can only begin to dream of.","After four years of experimentation, Tim Kinsella killed Joan of Arc.

Idiology,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3df69fc7814a47cd754/1:1/w_160/ed1038bf.gif,2001-04-30 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5461-idiology/,Thrill Jockey,"There's a stereotype that people who like to write about music eventually become jaded. After years of sawing through one stack of promo records after another, the thinking goes, critics develop a love/hate relationship with the medium and begin to think of listening as drudgery. Adding some credence to this idea is the undeniable fact that music writers are so often confronted with music they find less than inspiring. I don't think this has happened to me, personally. I'm more excited with exploring new sounds than ever, and I'm always impressed with how much truly great stuff is out there. I will say, though, that I rarely find a record that completely devastates me. After spending so much time listening, thinking, and comparing different sounds, sometimes I think the language of music has a smaller vocabulary than I once imagined. If it's true that anything is possible in art, it's equally true that 99% of the people making it couldn't give a toss; they're perfectly content to find a way to express themselves by building directly on the past. And there's not a thing wrong with that. Innovation, after all, is not the same thing as quality. Every once a while, though, I hear a record that has a truckload of both these qualities, and I get that coveted ""blown away"" feeling. The Boredoms' Super Ae was one such record, and Mouse on Mars's Idiology is another. Just about everything I love about music these days is on this album somewhere, and it has made me so very happy. The key word when Jan St Werner and Andi Toma sat down to make this record was ""more"". More melody, more instruments, more singing, more sounds, and more noise. Almost half the eleven songs feature vocals of some kind, all of them sung by the band's versatile drummer Dodo Nkishi. These range from the hyper-processed ""Actionist Respoke"", with its oddly funny, high-pitched screams, to the dense, layered harmonies of ""Presence"", where Nkishi channels the fragile harmonies of Yes. Strings and horns are all over Idiology, and throughout I'm astonished at the odd and beautiful ways Mouse on Mars combine traditional orchestration with electronics. ""Subsequence"", for example, opens with a tough, funky digital groove that reminds me of what I imagined Prince's mythical Black Album might sound like before I heard it. And then, just a little over a minute in, an acoustic grand piano joins the fray, playing chords that, I swear, seem lifted from Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"". The first time I heard it, I did a doubletake and then realized how rarely I feel genuinely surprised by a piece of music. My admiration only grew as clarinets, violins and French horns folded into the charming and rhythmically irresistible track. Even more leftfield for Mouse on Mars is ""Presence"". I've heard others compare it to Robert Wyatt, but my prog background is limited, so let's just agree that it sounds like a song from a time when bearded men were interested in expanding the boundaries of rock. Those hoping for a more contemporary reference point might consider Gastr del Sol. Like the best tracks on Camoufleur, ""Presence"" is baroque pop, thick with virtuosic electronic detail. From the angelic but not-quite-catchy melody, to the words (which seem to be about either the phenomenology of being or Led Zeppelin's seventh album), to the folky, horn-drenched coda, ""Presence"" is dense enough to dissect over the course of a hundred listens. I love fact that Idiology can contain both the nouveau prog of ""Presence"" and ""Doit"", which is industrial reggae as played by Tom Waits's Rain Dogs band, complete with pedal steel guitar. More than any other song here, ""Doit"" shows that Mouse on Mars can write interesting lyrics when so inclined: And the ship up there that wants to leave
Filled up to the brim with children
Hangs a little while, but the string
Is wearing-- silently I love the tension in these words. What's going to happen when that string gives way? If the additions are what make this record distinctive, what's left out is what makes it brilliant. The brief ""Paradical"", probably my favorite track here, illustrates the point. It starts with two chords that sound played on an out-of-tune piano with ball-peen hammers. A strange and lovely melody in an Eastern scale enters, first on synthesizer, then on subtly building strings. Finally, as the small orchestra completely overtakes the track and the beautiful melody is fully unveiled, the song disappears. Like this 49-minute album, ""Paradical"" is over much too quickly. But desire is more interesting than satiation, which is why God invented the repeat button.","There's a stereotype that people who like to write about music eventually become jaded.

Miss E: So Addictive,Missy Elliott,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc50c0084474cd0c2a75/1:1/w_160/cbb707b4.jpg,2001-04-30 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2757-miss-e-so-addictive/,Elektra,"A lot of albums kick off with the killer track. Some even manage a cool one-two punch. Missy Elliott's third record, on the other hand, opens with a six-track attack that's rare for any genre, especially contemporary R&B.; I find it hard to believe I'm only a third of the way into the record when this first-rate succession ends. But even with this initial run of excellence, So Addictive has much more in store. Elliott makes good on her intro's promise of ""some shit that you never heard before."" A range of beats-- from the minimal funk of ""Dog in Heat"" to the demented tabla of the single, ""Get Ur Freak On""-- are punctuated by wild vocal pyrotechnics and tempered by soulful crooning. In fact, there's more singing on this record than rapping. Elliott's low, throaty moans, aerial cooing, and delicious screams demonstrate tremendous restraint and control. In ""I've Changed (Interlude)"", she rightly berates Lil' Mo for suggesting she sings like ""she's in church trying to raise money for choir robes."" ""Dog in Heat"" starts as a simple lowdown funk track, building gradually upon a simple bass riff and drum thunk. Elliott piles layers of vocals atop Timbaland's multiplying strings and rattles, and eventually veers off into an entirely new direction at the song's end. Redman and Method Man also provide raps, adding comic relief and charisma. Elsewhere, Missy harmonizes with herself on ""One Minute Man"", again keeping the beat simple under a squeaking synthesizer hook, and this time allowing Ludacris to reprise the record's freak-getting-on theme by promising not a mere pit stop, but a full night's stay at Casa de Intercourse. Missy finally breaks out the rap on ""Lick Shots"", twisting her voice around a Southern/Martian accent. ""Y'all don't HEAR me/ You've got your guns but you don't SCEEER me/ BRRRRAAGHH!"" The crazy phrasings and vocal eruptions that dominate this album are introduced here, and then let loose in the anthemic ""Get Ur Freak On"", where they halt beats and maneuver labyrinthine rhythm structures like ""Lexus Jeeps"". Its hook features the sort of Eastern percussion that runs rampant on Top 40 radio, but rarely is it used so effectively. Timbaland's technique is undeniably masterful, too, as he plays with meter, dynamics and expectations, allowing Missy to stop and spit ""HOLLA!"" and ""Shhh..."" over surreal stillness and silence. ""Scream (aka Itchin')"" shakes its maraca under some prickles of shrill synths while Elliott details a sexual encounter. Rapid-fire rhyme quatrains and triplets spew forth, punctuated by screams like something the Bomb Squad used to blast for Public Enemy. ""Old School Joint"" comes along to ""flip the beat"", keeping So Addictive stylistically varied while pushing dance music to euphoric heights. Its ""flashlight"" and ""neon light"" references pay homage to P-Funk, but rather than mimicking the seminal funkateers, Missy integrates a heavier disco sound, creating something fresh out of an otherwise tired influence. ""Take Away"", though, attempts to update early Prince ballads, and instead reveals how those slow R&B; jams depended on The Artist's histrionics to carry the song. And despite having already proven herself more than capable of similar theatricalities, she relies on played-out vocoder, and irrationally allows Ginuwine to dumb things down with ""sensitive"" crooning. So Addictive is further held back by sporadic low points during its second half. Not even reversed cymbals, snazzy rim shots and processed soul-girl harmonies can distract from the fact that neither ""Step Off"" nor ""X-tasy"" actually go anywhere. Also guilty are the superfluous remix of ""One Minute Man"", featuring Jay-Z, and a religious bonus track that has its mind, and length, set on eternity. Still, there are three absolutely killer songs on So Addictive's second half. ""4 My People"" features Missy at her most sincere, begging, ""Put the needle on the track/ Skip that, flip that, bring the beat back."" ""Slap Slap Slap"" is both ferocious and psychedelic, with a backwards guitar and some fierce guest turns by Da Brat and Jade. And, after a pointless but impressive Busta Rhymes interlude, ""Whatcha Gon' Do"" rolls through with Timbaland's guttural rap and a rumbling beat that loops around itself like a perpetual motion machine set on accelerate. Synthesizers hiss like hydraulic pistons and hover like boomerangs while background guitar sounds wail like ghost cats in heat. Of course, to say Miss E is addictive is pushing it. Sure, I'm having a great time experimenting with this stuff right now. But I can stop any time I want.","A lot of albums kick off with the killer track. Some even manage a cool one-two punch.

Mutilate Us,AM/FM,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06cc0084474cd0bfb8d/1:1/w_160/409e8223.gif,2001-04-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/144-mutilate-us/,Polyvinyl,"In the top right corner of the cover of Mutilate Us, below the bandname and album title, is a quote culled from the LP's title track: ""And if we are the ones that will cross mountains for love/ Then we are the ones that let love mutilate us."" It's hard to think of a tactic that's more self-congratulatory than incorporating lyrics into your cover art, especially when they're also printed in the liner notes. And really, it doesn't benefit much in the way of advertising. The words are just shy of being trite, and bespeak no insight that goes beyond the obvious. Plus, the abstract construct of ""love"" is the crux of the sentiment. So, it's at least a little surprising that scrupulous ex-Franklin member Brian Sokel and multi-instrumentalist Michael Parsell's current project, AM/FM, doesn't come off the least bit smarmy on record. The Philadelphia-based duo's debut full-length is an unpretentious collection of lo-fi, acoustic-based pop tunes bolstered by Sokel's warm delivery. AM/FM has the charm and slightly skewed pop sensibilities of Ween, but in song structure only. Though, come to think of it, fecal humor and hallucinogenic abuse might be intriguing coming from the Polyvinyl camp. Mutilate Us successfully skirts stuffiness with light-hearted sincerity. On the upbeat ""Secretly Odds in Knowing Normal Words,"" Sokel sings, ""You said I was full of shit/ But what's wrong with that?"" backed by bouncy percussion and hand-claps. ""Yours Recklessly"" is minor-keyed, folk territory, not entirely dissimilar from Elliott Smith's recent offerings. It opens on a wobbly solo-acoustic note, but the song's dense, swelling climax is a lovely pay-off. ""Time Flows Much More Slowly This Way"" is almost absurd in its catchiness, and serves as just one of many examples of the adroit songwriting showcased on the album. This doesn't mean, though, that Mutilate Us is as consistently great as the aforementioned tracks. Sokel and Parsell sometimes sink too comfortably into poppiness and end up tripping over yesteryear's indie rock clichés. ""You and Me at 53"" is pedestrian in its aim to emulate the Cars, and its execution is worse still, echoing latter-day Promise Ring emergencies. ""Leanne, The Seasons Persist"" tends toward emo-pop with quiet, building instrumentation during the verses, but the predictability of the song's explosive between-verse segues render them completely ineffective. Still, the occasional misfires of Mutilate Us are forgivable; like most of the record's tracks, they're brief, often clocking in under two minutes. And when the record is successful, it's like a piston blasting warm guitar pop at incredible speeds. The bulk of the record is so assured that by the time its last lines are sung (those that adorn the album's cover), it's hard to not take their genuineness to heart and believe them.","In the top right corner of the cover of Mutilate Us, below the bandname\n\ and album title, is a ...

Rock Action,Mogwai,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37cea9e61561daa7f1f/1:1/w_160/2adcce82.gif,2001-04-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5365-rock-action/,Matador,"There are a few things in this world I'm pretty sure of. One of them is that, in a ""Survivor""-like desert island competition between Mogwai and fellow crescendo-rockers Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Mogwai would be taking home the grand prize. While Godspeed's Efrim Menuck would spend his time trying desperately to craft cigarettes out of coconut shells, picking bugs out of his beard, and figuring out a way to fabricate cellophane in which to bury the dead, Mogwai's Stuart Braithwaite would be busy sabotaging the enemy camp, starting bonfires, and dancing naked under the light of the moon. Alright, so maybe I'm exaggerating. But it can't be denied that of all the bands making epic, apocalyptic rock music these days, Mogwai seem to be the only ones who can sit back at the end of the day and have a good laugh. Sure, their music can be extremely serious and deeply affecting, but there's an element of adventurousness and willingness to fuck with your expectations that makes Mogwai less dire than their competitors. This adventurousness is evidenced by the fact that Mogwai managed to craft a brilliant debut-- 1997's Young Team-- that achieved the sainted goal of balancing fragile beauty and overwhelming sonic terror. Young Team allowed Mogwai to perfectly encapsulate the essence of their namesake-- those crazy little critters from the movie Gremlins. I still remember the song of the Mogwai; it's a simple, beautiful melody sung in freakish la-la's, yet signifies imminent destruction and face-rippage. Such was the case with Young Team-- a beautifully orchestrated melodic passage could successfully lull you into submission. You pet it. You kiss it. You feed it after midnight... and boom! Layered feedback, crashing cymbals, vacuum cleaner noises, claws, teeth, and wanton destruction. Sadly, the follow-up to Young Team, 1999's Come On Die Young, replaced the aural explosions of the debut with gradual burnouts. Songs that could potentially have been made great seemed to go absolutely nowhere, resulting in an album full of wasted promise-- a better soundtrack to an afternoon nap than a terrifyingly beautiful explosion. So what did the boys in Mogwai do? Did they go home and whine to their mamas? Of course not. Mogwai isn't a band of words, they're a band of action-- in this case, Rock Action. As of late, the music press has been falling all over itself to point out that-- get this-- Rock Action is not actually full of action, nor does it rock. And while, yes, the album is, for the most part, a very deliberate, moderately paced album, it manages much like Young Team to pack a stellar amount of energy into a medium-tempo rock song. Which is not to say that Rock Action is a carbon copy of Young Team. Far from it, in fact. Perhaps the greatest difference between this record and its predecessors is the expanded range of sounds incorporated. In the past, Mogwai have been largely guitar-driven, relying on plucked melodies coupled with soaring feedback crescendos to create their trademark sound. Here, such diverse elements as banjos, patterned static, and the Welsh (singer Gruff Rhys from Super Furry Animals) are incorporated, making Rock Action the most sonically dense release of Mogwai's career thus far. This more complex sound has its ups and its downs. On the positive side, it makes Rock Action a really fun album to pick apart. Dave Fridmann's production is flawless, affording each instrument just the right mix of distinction and ambiguity to create an engaging, yet cohesive whole. Unfortunately, this expanded repertoire comes at a cost. One could say that Rock Action is more focused on sound and less so on melody and structure than the classic Young Team. As a result, the epic ""You Don't Know Jesus,"" the album's standout track, never attains the level of jaw-dropping perfection that Young Team's ""Like Herod"" or ""Mogwai Fear Satan"" laid claim to. Still, Rock Action certainly has its peak moments. Aside from ""You Don't Know Jesus,"" two shorter tracks-- the opening ""Dial: Revenge"" and ""Secret Pint""-- perfectly showcase the strengths of Mogwai's new direction. The former, which features the talents of the aforementioned Gruff, puts vocals to better effect than the band's previous singing excursions, creating a stunningly gorgeous orchestral rock track that seems to extend far beyond its 3\xBD-minute duration. The latter, the album's closer, puts to work sparse piano, huge-sounding drums, and mumbled vocals, giving a beautiful ending to a similarly beautiful record. Despite the changes the band has been through on the road from Young Team to Rock Action, there are enough unifying elements to conclude that those of you who seriously dug the band's earlier work will find a lot to like about the record. Granted, it's not mind-blowing, and it's not nearly as masterfully executed and affecting as their earliest work. But there are only a handful of bands out there that can put out an album as well-constructed as Rock Action and still expect people to bitch and moan about it. The fact that Mogwai can laugh at their detractors could either lead to the band pursuing brave new directions in rock, or traveling down a path of smug self-satisfaction and stagnation. Either way, Rock Action suggests that it'll be worth sticking around to find out.","There are a few things in this world I'm pretty sure of. One of them is that,\n\ in ...

8000 B.C.,Otto Von Schirach,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9735e6ef95969321409/1:1/w_160/9f825207.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:09,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8494-8000-bc/,SchematicSchematic,"As computers accelerate and software becomes more sophisticated, we're nearing the point where you can create any sound you could ever imagine. From the evidence on Otto Von Schirach's 8000 B.C., this young man from Miami can imagine many, many sounds, and he knows how to translate what he hears in his head into 1s and 0s. In terms of the diversity of sounds produced, 8000 B.C. is an impressive display of programming skill. But then, so was Linux, and yet I've never felt inclined to pour over the code. Perhaps some endeavors are so entwined with technical mastery that only technical masters can truly appreciate it. From where I sit, 8000 B.C. feels like that kind of record. This is dense, frenetic IDM for those obsessed with nothing so much as change. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a single track here might contain more than 100 individual patches, each of which is manipulated in a number of ways. Obviously, when you're dealing with these kinds of numbers, you're not going to have much open space left over. And master tape saturation seems to be one of the goals of 8000 B.C. This isn't a bad thing in itself, but what's missing for me is any sense of a relationship between the various elements. They seem so interchangeable, like a single Cubase track could be cut and pasted from any one of these pieces into another and the result would be the same. Half these tracks are nearly indistinguishable from one another, crammed with every possible permutation of buzz, click, thwack and blurp. And these I just have to let slide by, occasionally pricking up my ears when I hear an interesting rhythmic combination amidst the chaos. But there are a handful of interesting spots. ""Schemotropolis Mirage"" reminds me of the Two Lone Swordsman's take on electro, taking the futurist genre that outpaced the technology of its time and yanking it into the 21st century. And it wisely leaves plenty of breathing room in between robotic drum hits, and adds eerie, almost RZA-like synthesized strings to actually create a mood. ""No Wood"" follows with the most ambient mood on 8000 B.C., an interesting slice of musique concrète that effectively suggests uneasiness without resorting to annoyance. Beyond that, Otto Von Schirach has crafted a lot of technically sophisticated music that strikes me as aesthetically cold and lifeless. Sure, it's a computer world, but where's the computer love?","As computers accelerate and software becomes more sophisticated, we're\n\ nearing the point where you can create any sound ...

Acre Thrills,U.S. Maple,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f79d034d5c69bf3b89/1:1/w_160/689451ca.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8373-acre-thrills/,Drag CityDrag City,"U.S. Maple does not feel like a band. U.S. Maple feels like a singular entity. U.S. Maple, a contradiction in and of itself, and a contradiction in sound, chaotic and disorganized in order to form a sort of unstructured structure, creating beauty and unpredictability out of fucked-up randomness. It sounds weird. It twists around an idea without warning and transforms into another then snaps back to the first. It rambles, seemingly aimlessly at first glance, but by the end, everything has taken its natural course, and nothing was truly out of place. U.S. Maple doesn't sound like anything else, except U.S. Maple. The singer part of U.S. Maple moans its alien lyrics, using virtually no dynamic, slurring its words together to create new ones, gasping for breath. The guitar and bass part creates spontaneous riffs, at once sounding classic like something you know you've heard and sounding as if they're fucking it up, playing upside down with their eyes closed and their fingers bent backwards. The rhythm part is always on the edge. U.S. Maple has released three albums before Acre Thrills, and this fourth effort represents a venture into actual melody, at least more so than they've attempted before. Traditional chord progressions are sometimes utilized, and occasionally, every instrument combines to create a full melody, but then the guitar neck starts to bend again or the bassist hits a wrong note or the cymbals fall off and it's all according to plan. The drums create much more of a rhythmic base than usual, but still sound as if the set's at the breaking point and could collapse at any minute. It creates an unpredictability missing in post-rock these days. Which brings me to another point, a genre. What is U.S. Maple, post-rock? Yes, perhaps in the strictest, most unique sense, as guitars that might have been used to create powerful, cohesive riffs are now used to turn those inside out, and drums that might have been used to pound out booming fills are now sped up and slowed down to highlight all the wrong moments, and there's no distortion, and the clean sound of the guitars becomes dirtied only by the inky fingers of the players. But it all comes together in something that works, and it's constantly new even after your twentieth listen. It's a malfunctioning machine that suddenly becomes aware of its existence. Something mechanical that breathes, creating random organic sequences of sound out of organic instruments based on a pre-planned, pre-programmed system meant to bend every notion of traditional guitar music out of shape. ""Total Fruit Warning"" ends with a cat's purr, but recorded in such a way that it sounds like an unworldly beast's filtered breathing, either dying or revitalizing itself, and that singular breathtaking moment represents the music of this entity as a whole. All this contradiction, all this paradox, it all feels natural. And in the end, U.S. Maple have finally reached brilliance with Acre Thrills, a gorgeously dangerous combination of everything they've seemed to strive for that now makes them imperfectly perfect.","U.S. Maple does not feel like a band.

A Man Under the Influence,Alejandro Escovedo,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca15e6ef95969322eb0/1:1/w_160/3aeb7b4c.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2830-a-man-under-the-influence/,BloodshotBloodshot,"Old cowpunks don't die, they just get softer. At least that seems to be the case with Alejandro Escovedo. He's been around for ages now, first appearing with mid-70s Bay Area punks the Nuns. In 1981, he made the move to Austin, Texas with his band Rank and File, whose Sundown album was vastly ahead of the rockabilly-punk curve. And he's been a stalwart on the scene ever since, playing with True Believers and Buick MacKane, in addition to recording his own solo work. His fifth solo effort finds him in territory several miles removed from his rough and tumble beginnings, and only once reaching for straight-up rock n' roll. (The rock number, a rollicking, curiously Georgia Satellites-ish ""Castanets"" guests Superchunk's John Wurster and Mac MacCaughan, though you'd never know it without reading the credits.) Instead, he spends time exploring the peaks and valleys of melody and rich arrangements, creating the most subtle, textured album of his career. Escovedo taps some high-powered guests to achieve this more ambitious sound, including ex-Whiskeytown frontman Ryan Adams on backing vocals, Buick MacKane's Joe Eddy Hines and ex-Let's Active frontman Mitch Easter on guitar, session drummer Hector Muñoz, the Squirrel Nut Zippers' Chris Phillips on percussion, and some guy named Cornbread on bass. But without a doubt, the two guest musicians who lend the most to A Man Under the Influence are Brian Standefer and Eric Heywood. Standefer's cello adds immense depth and color to all but one song here, serving as an effective countermelodic foil for Escovedo's steady tenor. For his part, Heywood (who has played with Richard Buckner, Freakwater, the Jayhawks, and Son Volt, to name just a few) provides the gorgeous steel guitar lines that brighten the corners of the swooning ballads that fill the bulk of the record. The record opens with two songs Escovedo penned for the travelling play ""By the Hand of the Father."" ""Wave"" begins with tense strumming over droning cello and double bass. Escovedo's voice hovers over the proceedings, declaiming, ""Wave goodbye, everybody waves goodbye,"" before the whole band slips into an easy groove and all tension is released. ""Rosalie"" follows, reminiscent of Key Lime Pie-era Camper Van Beethoven, a frequent comparison point for the mid-tempo numbers, as Escovedo and David Lowery have similar melodic styles. The album's two high points come during two of those mid-tempo numbers, ""Rhapsody"" and ""Velvet Guitar,"" both of which offer a look at Escovedo's passion for music. Our social conditioning and all the Mexican Day of the Dead imagery in the artwork automatically suggest alcohol to us when we hear the album title, but it's these two songs that make it clear that Escovedo is primarily under the influence of his love for music. ""Rhapsody"" finds him musing, ""If the melody escapes me/ I will stumble upon it soon/ If it's not a rhapsody/ Then it'll just have to do."" ""Velvet Guitar"" is just flat-out joyful, and features five guys playing electric guitar. Five guys! That's a lot of guitar. Thankfully, Chris Stamey's clear production keeps them all in their respective places, avoiding a sloppy mess. Of the slowest tracks here, ""Wedding Day"" is the best, with vocalist Lynn Blakey harmonizing with Escovedo over Standefer's sonorous cello and subtle harmonium. It's pretty without totally sacrificing its edge, as is ""Follow You Down,"" a melancholy acoustic ballad swimming in David Perales' violin overdubs. On the whole, A Man Under the Influence doesn't offer much to criticize; it's well-played, well-written, solid music from a certified veteran. Very occasionally, the band gets to a point where too many people are playing, and none are doing anything that spectacular. But this is a weak complaint, and one that hardly bares mentioning. In truth, A Man Under the Influence feels like the culmination of a great career. And Escovedo is one old cowpunk we should hope doesn't go out to pasture any time soon.","Old cowpunks don't die, they just get softer. At least that seems to be the\n\ case with Alejandro ...

Who's there?
cLOUDDEAD.
cLOUDDEAD who? That's the question, but few have the same answer. The group got the name from the punchline to the kind of nonsensical joke every kid sister tells. cLOUDDEAD (aka rappers Odd Nosdam, Why? and Dose One), are part of that tinderbox of web-board flamewars, the Anticon collective. The appearance of a crew of white MCs and an album called Music for the Advancement of Hip-Hop was bound to stir controversy. Were they ambitious backpackers or hyped-up marketeers? Well, regardless of the beef between Sole and former Company Flow head El-P, or the larger battle about whether Anticon's projects are hip-hop at all, they're without a doubt a rising power. cLOUDDEAD's first album, which collects the 10-inches they released from 1998 to 2000, fits this picture perfectly. ""apt.A"" greets with a warm, choral hum, clearly in the Boards of Canada neighborhood. The silence is broken by a dull drum loop and spiral synths, a mix that serves as a prelude to Dose One's verse. Too many heads can't get past his nasal delivery, which sounds like he's been boning too many thug harmonies. Combine his chatter with the washed-out, repetitious flow of the music and the effect can be narcotic. In a recent interview, Dose One was quoted saying the album was ""gonna be a banger,"" but the mastering's too dirty for any sound to rattle speakers. Considering the album was made on a Dr. Sample, a Radio Shack mic and an eight-track, though, the overall effect is pretty fresh. Dose One and Why? drop prose completely devoid of traditional hip-hop imagery. Their verses are scrapbook pages of memories and observations, packed dense with adjectives and short on linking phrases. Sometimes their impressionist flourishes are simply beautiful, like, ""I wonder what my mother looked like pregnant/ I've classified water damage as art/ Ruining things/ Trilobyte out on the town/ Painting things in accordance with my weird ordinance/ My style is glass cutter/ Delicate/ Intense/ Shooting out the moonlights with my tongue depression in a vacuum."" Other times, their poetical brushes overlap and muddy the canvas. Countless in-group references seem the product of late-night blunted gatherings, until you catch the lyrics written out in the liner notes. If these words are pre-written, and not freestyle, then at times these guys are trying too hard to be all artfully abstract. cLOUDDEAD's 74 minutes bring surprises. The most startling is the 11-minute suite ""Jimmy Breeze,"" which begins with a stupid skit and rapid-fire conga pattering, burbles up an 8-bit Nintendo sample, and then features lyrical protocol on how to survive a four-story fall. The vocals fade, a deep bassline drifts in, and sampled drum fills roll out a jam. Just as you expect DJ Shadow to appear, wondering ""What does my soul look like?,"" the MCs sing out a gospel groove, voices straining for that high pitch. The second track of the suite, an elegy for a friend who killed himself in art school, blazes with regret, jaded irony and critique: ""We seem to be sinking deeper into a vat of honey glaze/ Shall we live or shall we laminate ourselves into a standard appetizing position?/ At school this quarter/ All the supply lists call for Reynold's wrap and contact paper.../ Am I here to start a dead butterfly collection?/ But friends: We've no longer a need for glitzy masters/ Who paint gold-leaf holy babies in the backs of cathedrals."" Waves of organ reverence signal the end of the piece. To accuse these moments of being interludes between the vocal tracks is to miss the point. Hazy shoegazed ambience and instrumentals full of slow, dusty beats comprise a huge portion of this album. Soulful rhythms will disappear entirely in the middle of a track, only to be replaced by monk-like chanting or funky breaks. Every time you try and grasp what's going on, the focal point shifts, a testament to cLOUDDEAD's nebulous aesthetic. Yet the crucial hip-hop signifiers are present: verse trading, shout-outs, a personal vocabulary full of slang hipsterisms. If you're in the mood to be on some experimental shit, check this out. Just don't jump on the played-out debate and try to define the group by what they're not. Otherwise, they've played the joke on you.","Knock knock.

Since this is my ""infamous sixth review,"" as they call it around here, I think I should take some time out to answer the question that's on all of your minds. Contrary to what many of you have suggested, I didn't join up with Pitchfork to do high-quality work for a high-quality site. Look at this article, for example. So far, it's pure crap! No substance at all! There are even obvious lies! Nope, I'm interested in Pitchfork for the quantity, not the quality. Publishing four reviews every weekday is no small feat, and there's a certain hivelike quality to Pitchfork that enables this sort of efficiency. I think I have a certain mindless, dronelike quality that complements the general Pitchfork ethic quite well. It's no surprise, then, that we Pitchfork workers tend to enjoy (at least more so than the general public) the sort of music that's characterized as ""droning."" There's something about a keyboardist leaning on one note for five minutes that reminds us of, oh, I dunno, the sound of record reviews being written. So, before I'm reassigned to the Built to Spill Adoration Division (Sector 6-B, to us), I'd like to pay my respects to Philadelphia's master-droners Bardo Pond. The Bardos, anchored by sibling guitarists John and Michael Gibbons, have been playing the fuzzed-out stuff of stoner dreams since the mid-90's, joining the frighteningly well-endowed Matador Records clan early on. Although their flirtations with melody have produced absolutely heavenly music, as on their quasi-dream-pop masterpiece, 1997's Lapsed, they've always been allied first and foremost to experimentation, crushing distortion, and, of course, the drone. Their new album, Dilate, follows the course they've already plotted, making a few distinct detours along the way. While previous albums gave a studio sheen to the noise, Dilate has a looser, more spontaneous feel to it. This allows a little more space to creep into the claustrophobia-inducing mix favored by the band. Thus, we now get to hear slow-building numbers like the first track, ""Two Planes,"" which begins with a clean guitar accompanying multi-instrumentalist Isobel Sollenberger's violin. Layers of distortion and rippling effects are gradually added until the song begins to sound like a truly monstrous dirge. ""Inside,"" another epic, propels itself with twangy, ramshackle picking, allowing the song to pick up some speed before it takes off into the stratosphere. Along with this, there's also a newfound interest in acoustic guitars-- quite unexpected considering the band's usual effects-heavy treatments. The acoustics often work their way under the churning sea of distortion, plinking away distinctly within the bleary turmoil of ""Aphasia."" But just as often they're equal partners with the drones. On ""Despite the Roar,"" haunting, heavily echoed tones bridge the gaps between deliberately spaced strums before both the acoustics and the electrics kick into a rhythm. Another excellent, unconventional track, ""Favorite Uncle,"" proves that Sollenberger's brittle vocal melodies can survive apart from the sea of sound that usually surrounds them. She begins accompanied only by two acoustics-- singing forlornly out from what sounds like the inside of an abandoned tin can-- before the band crashes in. Even within what seems to be familiar territory, the album's willingness to take risks can provide interesting new angles into the band's music. ""Lb.,"" for example, begins with a lumbering dinosaur-on-acid riff. A few minutes into the song, most of the band falls out, and another plodding guitar figure enters. However, drummer Ed Farnsworth and bassist Clint Takeda immediately thrust this into double-time, throwing an invigorating splash of bongwater in the face of the complacent listener. While drones tend to become a bit predictable, there's an inherent instability in the music that keeps it vital most of the time. Still, there's a druggy complacency that sometimes gets the better of them, allowing a menacing jam like the final track, ""Ganges,"" to go on too long. The album's adventurousness can also go a bit overboard in, as it does in ""Sunrise,"" which features backwards-echoing vocals and guitars that do little to help the song. ""Swig"" also departs from the Bardo formula with none-too-interesting results, opting for an Eastern-sounding sitar simulation. With all of its experimental angles pulling in different directions, Dilate also experiences a lack of cohesion that didn't really factor into the band's previous albums. While it isn't quite as glorious as Lapsed, Dilate does offer a good deal of interesting material-- certainly enough to keep a hive like ours happy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go smear royal jelly on Schreiber's ass.","You know, when I sort through the bags of letters Pitchfork readers from around the world send to me every ...

Dizzy Spells,The Ex,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc3eb335119a49ecd32/1:1/w_160/1e75e413.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2860-dizzy-spells/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"Consider these statistics: there are 12 songs on the Ex's 11th album, Dizzy Spells, and the record is an hour long. Rarely is a song less than four minutes long, and they often nearly reach the six-minute mark. One of these songs even begins with a minute of soft string-scratching effects on the guitar. Now, the Ex are from Amsterdam, and they seem punk enough, but according to everything I supposedly know about time measurement and how it corresponds to a punk song, these tracks are way too long to be punk songs. Is a Dutch minute equivalent to 2\xBD American minutes, maybe? Can I get a foreign relations expert in here, please? This fact clarifies that I'd be doing punk fans a disservice if I recommended Dizzy Spells to them. Why, by the tenth second of inactivity or repetition past the norm, they'd simply hate me. Of course, they probably hate me anyway for making such offensive generalizations. You can't win in the world of entertaining music criticism, I say. C'est la vie. Maybe I'm questioning all this because, like any punk band with a rebellious, fuck-Disney attitude, the Ex seem like they want people to ask questions-- questions likes: what are they so agitated about? Should we be agitated, too? How are their songs so long? Don't they get bored playing them? Oops. Silly me. I've been leaving a word and a hyphen out of my description of the Ex. See, the Ex aren't really straight punk; they're ""art-punk."" Angular guitars, intellectually abstract (or abstractly intellectual?) lyrics, oddly clattering beats, and yes, six-minute songs are all thrown into the mix. The Ex seem to borrow more from Wire and the Talking Heads than the Ramones and the Stooges. With every jagged, awkwardly phrased musical figure, you can visualize the band shoving their equipment just that much closer to the edge of Sanity Cliff. The lyrics do indeed prove that the Ex are angry about something. When the band started out in the early 80's, their music was virtually packed with pro-socialist, ultra-liberal propaganda. These days it's not so obvious, but apparently, they're still not fans of big business. Take ""Walt's Dizzyland,"" for example: ""Mickey, Walt and Donald/ And goofy cousin Ronald/ They wanna swallow all your souls/ Like they've inked a pact."" And ""Karaoke Blackout"" contains that all-too-popular topic for those rebellious kids, individuality and non-conformity: ""They should stop thinking for myself!"" But Dizzy Spells is good. Oh, it's damn good, all right. The Ex are experts at effectively jarring dissonance, but they're not just noisy, either; they're well versed in creating musical chaos. Granted, melody isn't too common, but when it does show up somewhere in the din, it's all the more welcoming. And with uber-engineer Steve Albini, the band is captured in their most raw, primitive form, with all imperfections exposed alongside the numerous perfections. Any studio gloss would have done this group an injustice. Unpredictability is key, and one of the more pleasant surprises must be described (read: ruined) in order to prove my point: on ""River,"" one of the many highlights here, softly played dissonant chords and a gentle, rolling snare carry the song's first half. The lyrics indicate change in mood and atmosphere: ""On your mark, take the plunge/ And face the next wave coming."" The first time those words are sung, the track suddenly jumps to aggressive, serrated riffs, with melody splayed out all akimbo, in a powerful uptempo cadence. The second time, it morphs into a truly combative punk rhythm, and the sentiment becomes determined and filled with desire: ""I wanna laugh and I want to love/ But not just love, that's not enough!"" The entirety of Dizzy Spells features enough gorgeously primitive twists like these to warrant an enthusiastic recommendation. These Dutch art-punks make truly exciting music, which is especially commendable when you consider they've been at it for so long. And the excitement is sustained so consistently over the hour-long running time that you'll almost begin to wish the six-minute songs were even longer. It's an hour of your life easily worth repeating. You might even find a reason to be this agitated. Hell, you might even find a reason to be Dutch. They're that good.","Consider these statistics: there are 12 songs on the Ex's 11th album, Dizzy\n\ Spells, and the record is ...

Feather Float,OOIOO,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e8eb335119a49ec8d5/1:1/w_160/3640ce51.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6013-feather-float/,BirdmanBirdman,"First of all, let's start off by saying that this record review is free of negative criticism, or any negativity for that matter. Second of all, I will tell you that I actually begin talking about this specific record in the fourth paragraph, because as usual, there is some expository material of possible entertainment and/or knowledge value to be gained first. Nothing to complain about now? Great, let's move on. Next, I'd like to give a shout-out to Japan. Ever notice how people say they'd like to ""give a shout-out"" to something, but they never really do it? I'm following through: ""JAAPAAAAAANN!"" Damn. Oh, Japan. Ohhhh, Japan! Sorry, I just haven't had enough. But you must understand. My love affair for Japan is just beginning to blossom. My liaison began with Buffalo Daughter and the super-smooth quirk-funk of their exceptional second record, New Rock. Then I became more anxious to get myself acquainted with the Japanese-American music maker crowd. Cibo Matto's Viva La Woman took me a little while, but it became an eye-opening record in its own right; more recently, I fell in love with the high-pitched croon of Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino. Then I became a fan of the chirping vocals and shimmering sound pastiches of Takako Minekawa. And finally, the Boredoms came along in my life and made me wonder how I ever listened to rock without them. I will sacrifice a vital appendage if necessary to see this band perform live once in my life. 1998's Super Are and 2000's Vision Creation Newsun were and still are landmark records in fucked-up, psychedelic, gorgeous, dynamic trance-rock. I considered frontman eYe Yamatsuka a god among men for quite some time, at least while immersing myself in those albums. I always noticed the excellent musicianship of the rest of the group, but I don't think I gave it enough credit to the quality of the records, usually assuming that the mastery of craft was in Yamatsuka's hands. Here's proof that at least part of the rest of the band had something to do with it. For those unfamiliar, OOIOO is a band featuring Yoshimi P-We, one-half of the drum section of the Boredoms. Along the way, bandmates and fellow Japanese women Kyoko, Maki and Yoshiko help her out on guitar, bass and drums, respectively. But Yoshimi is clearly the driving force, taking the production reins and performing most of the vocals and instruments. Their second and latest record, Feather Float, may not be a defining masterpiece, but I'll be damned if it doesn't make me a super happy guy. The Boredoms are unmitigated genius, which may include joy, but OOIOO are unmitigated joy, which needs not include genius. See, according to the scientific and über-accurate Pitchfork ratings guide, I've already labeled Feather Float ""amazing,"" informing you that it ""will likely rank among [my] top three records of the year"" before I've barely said a word about it. This is all accurate as far as I can tell, although who knows what the hell those year-end list things are like even in October, let alone here in May. So allow me to explain, won't you? I could go with a moment-by-moment, track-by-track analysis, but the feeling of this record doesn't come through that kind of language. Instead, I'm going to say what I love about it. I love the energy. OOIOO's brand of rhythmic psych-rock on Feather Float exudes definite soulful excitement. Yoshiko's drums rock the way Yoshimi's do in the Boredoms; panicked, frantic, at times tribal, but always steadily keeping the beat. The rhythms and activity of the music are nearly out of breath, but never rushing to catch up. Every instrument, natural or electronic, is used to drive the music forward. It's a sort of loose intensity; there's power and vigor, but no pressure. I love the contrast. When there is music, there is energy, but sometimes there isn't music. This allows for the energy to rest and build again. Throughout the record, these moments of silence give way to birds chirping, crashing cymbals, and soft building drones, which all patiently await the next explosion of activity. Feather Float could not have been arranged differently and remained as effective as it is now. I love the pure love of sound that is so obviously demonstrated on this recording. Phasing effects and electronic tones are used liberally, but the feeling remains organic and authentic. Sometimes a sound is repeated over and over again as we revel in its glory; sometimes it's cut short to make way for an even more glorious one. I love the vocals. Yoshimi sings most of the vocals in OOIOO, with help from fellow guitarist Kyoko, and they have nothing to do with lyrics. When words are used, whether in English or Japanese, the language bears little relevance. They just add incalculably to the end result. The aforementioned energy translates into the vibrant, layered voices. The harmonies don't just soar, they create rhythms. Sometimes sharp intakes of breath and brief yelps punctuate the beat for emphasis. Sometimes the singers become so enthusiastic that it doesn't matter if they're out of tune, and we're eventually singing out of tune with them. When they are in tune, it's angelic and at times breathtaking. I love the name, and the title. OOIOO-- simple syllables which seemingly emanate a sense of awe, or release. Feather Float-- fully unpretentious, with a liberating, carefree connotation. I love Feather Float. It's a record that causes me to gush over great lengths. Hopefully by now I've given enough of the idea of how it sounds without ruining the surprises and the pleasant new feeling of hearing it for the first time. It currently stands on its own, not just as something to tide over Boredoms fans, but as something to hold in high regard in your collection, something even perhaps to introduce an uninitiated friend into the world it represents. And it makes me want to make my affair with Japan a full-on marriage. But we'll still need to get to know each other a little more before we set the date, honey. And where the devil will we have our honeymoon?","First of all, let's start off by saying that this record review is free of\n\ negative criticism, or ...

"Fetch the Compass, Kids",Danielson Famile,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89eea9e61561daa5879/1:1/w_160/9c234bc7.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2166-fetch-the-compass-kids/,Secretly CanadianSecretly Canadian,"Hi kids! Welcome to ""Uncle Matt's Happy Time!"" This is the place where we discuss animals, games, and indie rock for little kids... just like you! Our guest today is Billy! Billy is six years old. He likes kittens and playing with Legos. He thinks girls are gross, especially his big sister! Let's say hi to Billy! What we're going to do today on ""Uncle Matt's Happy Time"" is show Billy some pictures and play Billy some music, to see what an average kid just like you has to say about it! First, let's show Billy a picture. What do you think of this picture, Billy? ""It's scary. It looks like doctors. Doctors have needles! I want to go home!"" Ha! Billy is silly! Those aren't doctors-- they're the Danielson Famile! Sometimes they like to dress up as doctors! And if they do have needles, odds are, they're not filled with anything they're going to want to use on you! ""Famile"" is French for family! In France, people don't take showers, and they go pee-pee in the street. Gross! The Danielson Famile like to make music together. Do we like music? Yes! Let's put on their new album, Fetch the Compass, Kids, and see what Billy thinks about it... and what you think about it! Fetch the Compass, Kids was recorded by the band's friend Steve. Steve is a very naughty man, and is in a band called Shellac. Shellac sing songs about bad things. But, luckily, the Danielson Famile don't! Let's have a listen! ""It's scary! It's going to hurt me! Mommy said I could go home when I want to! I want to go home!"" Ha! Don't be silly, Billy! The Danielson Famile won't hurt you! They're Pentecostal, which means that they like Jesus a lot! Jesus died for your sins, Billy. He was crucified and died. Do you think Jesus would want to hurt you? Of course not! ""He doesn't sound like Jesus! He sounds like a mouse! Or a scary clown! He is going to hurt me! I want to go home!"" Ha! Don't be scared, Billy! The Danielson Famile is all about family. Why, they're probably a little bit like your family! Their family has quiet time! Does your family have quiet time? Why don't we read some of the Danielson Famile's lyrics from the song, ""We Don't Say Shut Up!"" The lyrics go, ""Quiet Time!!!/ My big mouth invites a beating."" Does that make you feel better, Billy? ""I don't want the scary man to beat me! He's going to kill me! Mommy said I could go home whenever I want to! I'm scared! Let me go home! Please let me go!"" It's okay, Billy. I understand that Danielson Famile can be kind of hard to take at times! Big brother Daniel's squeaky vocals, and the generally saccharine, over-the-top music are more reminiscent of the clown in Stephen King's It than any friendly clown at your friend's birthday parties. Stephen King wrote books with bad words, and he got hit by a car! ""I don't want to get hit by a car! I don't want to listen to this! Let me go! Let me go! Mommy said you have to let me go!"" Sorry, Billy, but your mommy isn't here! And Big Mean Mr. Jones is guarding the doors. Big Mean Mr. Jones has a big closet full of red-hot pointy things, and likes to eat children. You don't want to make Big Mean Mr. Jones angry, do you? Of course not! Danielson Famile is all about being happy! Why, it's kind of like the CD we played during last week's ""Happy Time,"" Of Montreal, except without the weird, complex song structures. In Montreal, the people wish they were French! Mega-gross! ""This album makes me feel like scary little men are poking sharp things into my head and smiling! Let me go home! Let me go home!"" Stop crying, Billy! I had a cousin who liked to cry, and he died, Billy. He died like a dog. Luckily, the frightening sugar high at the beginning of this album can't be sustained! The Famile are at their best when they're busting out hyperactive, hyper-memorable pop hooks that stay lodged in your mind to remind you that God and family are good, and that saying ""shut up"" is bad! A Famile like this one only works when they're going full-blast, and parts of this album just seem bland and awkward. That makes us say ""yuck!"" ""I can't take it any more! Please please let me go! I want to go play in the street with the other boys! I don't want to die! I don't want to die!"" Awww... well, okay, Billy. We're going to let you go now! But just try to leave without having songs like ""Rallying the Dominos"" or ""Let Us A.B.C."" stuck in your head! You can leave the Famile, Billy, but the Famile won't leave you! ""No! No! You're mean! My daddy is a lawyer! He's going to make you pay!"" Whoa, there, Billy! Don't forget Big Mean Mr. Jones! He sharpens his teeth with razor blades, and he loves the taste of little boy! All you can do, Billy, is try to remember that the Danielson Famile are oftentimes more annoying than they are scary. If you can just sit back and let yourself enjoy it, without being irked or creeped out, it's actually kind of fun! I know I'm having fun! Are you having fun, Billy? Billy? Oh, Billy?","Hi kids!

Necessity: The Four-Track years,Jason Falkner,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2fabf31b7dc7155ebb/1:1/w_160/04ffe88f.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2964-necessity-the-four-track-years/,spinARTspinART,"Jason Falkner is a wuss of considerable talent. That wussiness derives from the style of music he writes and performs, a sweet, polished, 60's-inflected brand of pop. His talent lies in his ability to mimic and synthesize the sounds of the Beatles, Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, et al, and to lay confident, memorable melodies over the syrupy blend. If his name sounds familiar, there's probably a reason. Falkner made a career out of semi-high-profile musical collaborations before his recent solo outings. As a member of Jellyfish, Falkner played second fiddle (but really just guitar) alongside drummer/vocalist Andy Sturmer. But despite their Genesis-esque setup, the band never attained ""Sussudio"" heights of glory, and Jason was once again the lone musician. Sometime later, Jason joined the Grays. The band released one moderately successful album, but a long-term venture it was not to be. Nevertheless, Falkner had established a reputation for arrangement and writing which would lead to his working with Air, ex-fine ex-Bangle Susannah Hoff, and Chris Cornell. Falkner was picked up by Elektra, which he humorously dubbed Neglektra, but parted ways with the label after 1996's Jason Falkner Presents Author Unknown, and its Nigel Godrich-produced follow-up Can You Still Feel tanked. Which brings us to the present: a twelve-track compilation of songs, both previously released and new to the world, that highlights Falkner's songwriting talent and skill with a four-track. The opener, ""She's Not the Enemy,"" happens to be the only song that wasn't recorded on the more rudimentary four-track format, but rather, on a 16-track. The extra tape space allows room for multiple guitar tracks, piano, goofy but great Moog keyboard lines, and layers of rich harmony. The song has a sort of new-wave Ocasek-meets-60's sugar-pop feel to it, and also stands as the album's most impressive showcasing of Falkner's skills as a multi-instrumentalist. All the parts are solidly performed-- most notably the simple but crisp, appropriate drumming. ""She Goes to Bed"" slows the pace down, but delivers more lush chord progressions and smallpox-catchy vocals. The Beatles begin to exert obvious influence on the third track, ""His Train."" The Beatles, of course, do the Beatles better, but Falkner isn't at all bad. Nonetheless, you have to ask yourself if you have extra padding in your wallet for enjoyable but thoroughly derivative music. Fortunately for Falkner, the next song could sway you towards, ""Yes, I do."" ""Song for Her"" finds him delving deeper into acid-era Beatles and pulling it off alarmingly well, even coaxing a dead-on McCartney impression from his pipes. ""Miracle Medicine"" is the only blazing rocker to speak of, comprised of equal parts the Who, bad early-80's rock, and Nirvana. Here, the vocals take a backseat to the frenzied, distorted, descending chords of the chorus and the propulsive drumming. Things falter, though, on ""The Hard Way,"" which is derivative without the ""but really good"" part. To make matters worse, the album sputters instead of roaring toward its conclusion. Of the last six track tracks, only ""Hectified"" and ""I Go Astray"" hit their mark. It's unfortunate considering the wonderful first half of the album. Still, even with its handful of losers, Necessity still offers an impressive group of songs with a lot for pop fans to savor. I wouldn't be surprised if Falkner finally got around to actually putting out a mind-blowingly great album some day.","Jason Falkner is a wuss of considerable talent.

Noites do Norte,Caetano Veloso,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92e13d1975652139812/1:1/w_160/9288aa1e.gif,2001-04-24 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8427-noites-do-norte/,Nonesuch,"In the United States, we're taught to think of slavery as an obsolete practice jettisoned in 1864 at the end of the Civil War by a victorious President Lincoln. It stands as one of the darkest chapters of our past, the shameful carrier of an enormous human price tag. In school, my teachers never flinched in their descriptions of slavery, always making sure to cast it in the worst light possible, and depict it as an abhorrent mistake that never should have happened. And rightly so. However, my Northeastern, suburban public school education also approached the issue from a one-dimensional standpoint, failing to examine the modern-day social repercussions of the not-so-long-dead institution, and also failing to discuss slavery's worldwide past. To us, it was a white-and-black thing, and a point of conflict between the North and South. But in reality, it always went way beyond that. Slavery is as old as civilization, and human degradation has persisted in many forms around the globe. Even today, in a world where we think so much has changed, there are individuals who trade in human beings, kidnapping children from developing nations and selling them covertly on a despairingly extensive international market. In the US, we're barely three generations removed from our ""peculiar institution"" (as 19th Century Southern politicians were fond of calling it), and its legacy still echoes in the halls of government, schools and even day-to-day life. Taking this into account, I can imagine that the issue is even more prescient in Brazil, where slavery was not abolished until May 13, 1888. In fact, there are many in Brazil's elderly population whose now-deceased parents once lived in forced servitude. His country's past with slavery is close to Caetano Veloso's mind on his most recent offering. The title Noites do Norte (Northern Nights) is actually extracted from a passage by noted Brazilian abolitionist Joaquim Nabuco. Nearly the entire first half of the album deals with the subject, before branching out into the general poetic musings on life in Brazil (and life in general) that have defined Veloso's past efforts. The extremely helpful liner notes offer facts and history, as well as English translations of the Portuguese lyrics. Foreign language recordings automatically lose some appeal to a lot of English speakers, but the vibrant music that Veloso and his large cast of collaborators create ought to put to rest any concerns we might have diving into it. David Byrne's recent work owes a huge debt to guys like Veloso and any Byrne fan would do well to give this a good shot. It's Veloso's most rock-oriented record yet, as well, which makes it a decent starting point for folks who are looking to grab a seat on the recent Tropicalia bandwagon. Veloso sometimes backs off a bit from the traditional polyrhythms of his old work here, imbuing the opening ""Zera a Reza,"" and the cheeky tribute to Brazilian legend Raul Seixa, ""Rock 'n' Raul,"" with fairly straight rock beats. The music layered on top, however, is full of traditional harmony, Portuguese guitars, and echoes of the traditional fado song style, imported from Portugal in the colonial era. The lyrics are also peppered with Afro-Brazilian deities, Brazilian drinks and musical styles, and holdover terminology from the Yoruba that most of the country's slaves spoke. ""Michelangelo Antonioni"" is a gorgeous tribute to the Italian director of such classic films as Blow Up and Red Desert (not to mention the bloated Zabriskie Point), with a short, meditative lyric surrounded by Veloso's beautiful, wordless tenor and a plaintive string arrangement. The music is strikingly lonely, even absent the realization that the first three lines translate to ""Vision of silence/ Empty street corner/ Page with no sentence."" The arrangements are universally effective vehicles for Veloso's songs; some are stripped but warm, while others are covered in a rich orchestral tapestry. His prodigiously talented son Moreno contributes an arrangement for ""13 de Maio,"" a song about the celebrations held to commemorate the abolition of slavery in Brazil by Princess Isabel during her brief regency. The ebullient percussion and guitar parts convey a profound joy, leading nicely to the laid-back groove and choral vocals of the Jorge Ben-penned ""Zumbi,"" a tribute to a rebel slave leader who established an autonomous state of freed slaves in central Brazil in the 17th Century. The song's haunting images of princesses shackled to ox carts in African port cities and ""bosses in between/ Watching the harvest of white cotton/ Gathered by black hands"" ring just as loudly in the U.S. as they do in Brazil. It's a shame that American record stores are so obsessed with categories and separation, because there are a lot of people who will never hear this simply by virtue of its placement in the international section. Though past efforts like 1997's Livro are slightly stronger, this is still a record that absolutely deserves to be heard by all, from an artist whose long career has proven him neither a slave to expectations nor his humble background.","In the United States, we're taught to think of slavery as an obsolete practice jettisoned in 1864 at the ...

Confield,Autechre,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14e13d19756521385c8/1:1/w_160/15340a05.gif,2001-04-17 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/365-confield/,Warp,"Autechre albums, like Stanley Kubrick films, are the substance of critics' nightmares. For all of his artistry, Kubrick occasionally dropped bombs like Barry Lyndon, a film that bored audiences at its debut and never gained relevance with time. All directors can claim their share of failures, but Kubrick's affinity for intellectual understatement often masked the initial appeal of his work, making it difficult for audiences to separate the wheat from the chaff when his movies first came out. Only the passage of time distinguished the strokes of cinematic brilliance from their clumsy, hollow counterparts; but reviewers, bound to deadlines, never got to enjoy the benefit of hindsight. Instead, they resorted to blind guesses, issued sharply divided reviews, and crossed their fingers in hopes that, when the smoke eventually cleared, the future would prove them right. So imagine my anxiety when I discovered I had only a week to come to terms with Autechre's new long-player, Confield. The group's oeuvre includes equal measures of visionary genius and uninspired tripe. While LP5 and Tri Repetae++ remind us that Rob Brown and Sean Booth have access to a talent matched by only a handful of contemporary electronic producers, Amber and Chiastic Slide suggest that this access is inconsistent, fleeting and out of their control. To further complicate things, Confield catches the pair in the most abstract, difficult period of their nine-year recording career. I've had the album for just over a week now, and must confess I'm still not certain I have a firm grasp on it. But I've given the songs enough effort and attention (headphones and speakers, stoned and sober, and several times without pause from beginning to end) to draw a few early conclusions. And it pleases me to announce that they're resoundingly favorable. Confield picks up where its predecessor, the four-track Peel Session 2 EP, left off-- splicing the ambient, non-musical styles of artists like Kit Clayton and Phthalocyanine into Autechre's more structured syntheses. Booth and Brown exercise a meticulous economy of melody on this disc, so much so that many of the tracks cease to resemble proper songs. They have instead assembled an album of ordered soundscapes-- nine methodically arranged pieces that rely largely on repetition of textural, dissonant and atonal sounds to construct a variety of aural climates. Think EP7 without the hooks. Think early Tetsu Inoue, with twice the depth and a penchant for foundry sounds. Now welcome to Confield, where the local time is the tomorrow. My first listen to this album required a great deal of toil and patience-- desperately listening for rhythms, trends, bits of melodic resolution and a general sense of cohesion. I made the mistake of launching straight into ""Bine,"" the sixth track, which discouraged me because it had none of those things. In retrospect, I should have started where Autechre wanted me to: with ""VI Scose Poise,"" the album's opener. Though one of Confield's least satisfying pieces, the first track offers a roadmap for the material that follows. Booth and Brown employ techniques in this song that recur more subtly in later tracks, and the opener becomes a means by which to understand some of the disc's more challenging material. The song is, in a sense, a metaphor for the record at large: patterns emerge from the discord; cacophonous droning wells up in tense knots, then dissipates with the appearance of three-note melodic bursts; the sonic hellstorm relents in scattered moments of clarity, but never recesses for long. Just as the melodies begin to acquire complexity, the song comes to an abrupt close, dropping the listener once again onto foreign soil. ""Cfern,"" which follows, comes out swinging with a disjointed barrage of elastic snares. Languid synth pads churn out a stagnant stew of dissonant notes, in which the clicks become burps and the cuts become bubbles. ""Pen Expers,"" next on the playlist, ups the tempo with a spastic drill-n-bass joint whose vacuum-navigated drums and reversed string hits evoke imagery of liposuction. Confield carries on like this until the final note-- each song establishes a personality distinct from the rest, cautiously balancing musicality with chaos. The latter half of the disc actually surpasses the former. The subtle funk of ""Parhelic Triangle,"" the record's apogee, reminisces of ""Acroyear2"" from LP5. A brooding, troglodytic bassline chugs through a spectral landscape of chimes, bells and railroad crossings, while the violent sounds of a threshing machine keep the pace. ""Lentic Catachresis"" closes the show with a blistering exercise in drum programming. Booth and Brown wind the beats progressively tighter, capping the album with a thick lid of percussive sound. Many long-time Autechre enthusiasts will feel alienated by the pair's latest release. It's not Tri Repetae++, but it's unlikely that Booth and Brown will ever revisit the trademark sound that brought them fame. For those willing to take these times in stride, Confield promises elegant production, accessibility in moderation, and one of the most enveloping, thought-provoking listening experiences to come forth from leftfield this year. You just have to reach for it.","Autechre albums, like Stanley Kubrick films, are the substance of critics' nightmares. For all of his artistry, Kubrick occasionally dropped ...

Just Enough Education to Perform,Stereophonics,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56ec0084474cd0c0705/1:1/w_160/476aa75e.gif,2001-04-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7508-just-enough-education-to-perform/,V2,"Britain and America have always had their differences: the whole tea thing; two archaic, musket-based wars in 25 years; the awkward, we-saved-your-ass vibe that WWII generated; the ongoing, blame-filled custody battle over Canada; and last, but certainly not least, the stuff we find on each country's respective radio dials. Observers of trends in pop music usually explain the discrepancies between who's big in the UK with who's big in the US by pointing to the more refined taste of the Brits. I mean, this is the country that gave the world the likes of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Byron and Roger Waters-- they're above reproach, right? That kind of logic usually holds up. Since the arrival of the Stereophonics, though, Americans have more solid, exception-noting ammo to deflate the Brits' balloon of superiority. With singles charting by the bucketload and their last album, 1999's Performance and Cocktails entering the British charts at No. 1, competing with and holding its own against Blur's 13, the Welsh band was the musical personification of a lager-loaded Arsenal football hooligan. And Britain ate them up. Once often compared to a second-rate Manic Street Preachers than to a third-rate Oasis, the Stereophonics are getting farther away from the aggressive, anthemic sound that characterized their earlier work. Considerably tamer than their stadium-rocking, chart-topping previous albums, Just Enough Education to Perform sounds less like a band voluntarily growing into their new-found maturity, and more like a pet's first, forced visit to the castration clinic. The soft, jangly guitar and softer acoustic strums lend the disc a General Foods International Coffees feel. Like something you'd share with you sister on the porch a sunny morn: Stereophonics and douche recommendations. And from a band that used to rock outdoors in the daytime, in front of tens of thousands of fans, J.E.E.P. marks a change in direction that can't be explained away by ""maturing."" The album opens deceptively with what, for all the world, sounds like an Aerosmith riff. Immediately after ""Vegas Two Times,"" though, the band slides into a warm-n-fuzzy, mid-tempo groove that's sure to offend no one. Throughout the album, ex-pugilist Kelly Jones serves up 11 tracks of vignette pop-rock. The basis for every song is a little slice-of-life, observational rumination. Jones emphasizes this point by graciously providing revealing liner notes regarding each song's origin. At times interesting, and no doubt welcomed by fans, that little trick might have been more appreciated had the songs been more worthy of the insights. Often fantasy-based-- of killing rock critics or stealing a van-load of money-- the narratives, unfortunately, are weak throughout. This is especially disappointing since the Stereophonics' lyrics always used to counterbalance (or outweigh, even) their music. Highlights of the disc come with two very different tracks. ""Step On My Old Size Nines"" uses a lite, acoustic country-pop feel that takes on the subjects of aging vs. getting what you want out of life with a soft-sell approach. And halfway through the album's 11 tracks, ""Nice to Be Out"" provides a commentary on historical tourism that plays off a simple melody line and a chorusless song structure. Paradoxically sing-songy and monotonic at the same time, the song is graceful, sophisticated and catchy all at once (yes, you are still reading the Stereophonics review, in case you were wondering). But too much of Just Enough Education to Perform is rehashed, refried and retreaded-- just about the balance of the disc, in fact. A mere three songs later, when ""Maybe"" uses the identical chord changes to ""Nice to Be Out,"" it would be great to consider it indicative of some kind of musical theme and not just evidence of a dearth of ideas. Alas, it is not so. ""Have a Nice Day"" has more sap than a Vermont maple. A conversation-cum-commentary as told by a cab driver to Jones, the song goes nowhere new with non-insights like: ""We're going wrong/ We've all become the same/ We dress the same ways/ Only our accents change."" The ""ba-ba-ba's"" in the background push the song from merely grating to room-fleeingly bad. Just when we were starting to accept them for the boisterous-but-genuine band that they were, they go and do something like this. After losing their arena-sized, distorted sound, the Stereophonics have all but stood up and declared to the world their intention to crack that difficult and finicky 35-50 yuppie market demographic. I sometimes wonder if these kinds of radical shifts in a band's sound can ever be attributed to the guys second-guessing themselves up to that point, like an atheist's death-bed conversion. The band, in their furious attempt to create something lasting and worthy of respect, winds up getting mediocrity mixed with a lack of sincerity. I bet God sees right through that.","Britain and America have always had their differences: the whole tea thing; two archaic, musket-based wars in 25 years; the ...

Leaves Turn Inside You,Unwound,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8efea9e61561daa5936/1:1/w_160/9863f80c.jpg,2001-04-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8365-leaves-turn-inside-you/,Kill Rock Stars,"What the fuck?: the one question any great album should elicit from you, involuntarily, like a musical doctor's mallet to your mind's knee. Ha, that's terrible! But, see, that's just it. A great album should have you grasping for horrible metaphors that come nowhere close to describing that ineffable whatever that makes good music so much more than just casual entertainment or pleasant background. Yes, the really good ones make you ask, ""What the fuck?"" with conviction. They extort feelings of reverence, awe, and respect from you. No doubt, you've heard that saying about the Velvet Underground-- you know, the one that claims that, though next to no one actually heard their debut album when it came out, everyone who did went out and started a band of their own. I'd like to be able to say something similar about Unwound, but strangely enough, it's to their credit that I can't. They do have the obscurity thing in common, though I suspect that Unwound sells a hell of a lot more albums than the Velvet Underground did in the Factory days. Still, while anyone with a stringed instrument and opposable thumbs could have taken a respectable stab at emulating the Velvet Underground's brand of frenzied noise, the same cannot be said for Unwound. Unwound is rock and roll, but only loosely speaking. It's often very aggressive with Justin Trosper belting out fractured lyrics like a napalmed banshee. But their music is so much more sophisticated, stranger and original than that of their contemporaries that it wouldn't be far from the truth to say they've written their own vocabulary and deployed a new syntax in this otherwise staid genre. Drawing inspiration from elements as disparate as Ornette Coleman's harmolodics, the compositions of Bela Bartók, rock and roll in general, and all points in between, Unwound have managed to rarely repeat themselves and never disappoint. In many respects, Leaves Turn Inside You is the band's most ambitious, sweeping, and difficult outing yet. First, there's the sheer length (an hour and fourteen minutes), and then there's the format (two video-enhanced discs). Yet, for its epic length, there are only fourteen songs on this album, which means there's some really, really long tracks here. And not only long, but epic in the ""Kashmir"" sense. And within those songs, there's enough going on to keep even the most attention deficit disordered among us intrigued. Take ""Terminus,"" for instance, which consists of three distinct segments. The first is a 3\xBD minute-long, maraca-laced, frenetically percussive song unto itself, rife with great rhythmic interplay between Justin Trosper's guitar and Vern Rumsey's thunderous bass. The lyrics could have been plucked from one of Gollum's riddles in The Hobbit: ""Break me I'm not broke/ Take me I'm not took/ Cake me I'm not cooked/ Fake me I'm not fucked/ Wake me I'm awake/ Shake me I'm a jerk/ Wash me I'm a lake/ Make me I'm a crook."" And there's a lot more where that came from. The song then gets plucky, quieter, and more tense. A phrase repeats itself with just a hint of cello and some Rhodes accompaniment. With every repetition the cello grows louder until it overtakes the guitar, drums, and bass completely. A psychotic string interlude follows, and without warning, the cello cuts out completely, signaling the beginning of section three, a pretty tune with a ghostly Rhodes melody and two wiry, intertwined guitars parts. If you're looking for another installment of The Future of What, or a return to New Plastic-era Unwound, you will be sorely disappointed. Let it go. You'd be doing yourself a heinous disservice to dismiss these songs for not reprising the Unwound of old; there's so much in the latest version of the band to be excited about. ""Treachery"" begins with a zany, Eno-ish synth intro which perfectly sets up the strangely 60's pop-sounding verse. From a production standpoint-- if not also from a songwriting one-- Trosper was inspired by Woodstock-era psychedelia, and this song is one of many moments in which that's distinctly recognizable. The band shifts keys between the verse and the chorus, and the keyboard is brought back for the song's infectiously sing-alongy ending. In the years that elapsed between Challenge for a Civilized Society and their latest, the band pieced together a home studio in order to emancipate themselves from the time and cost constraints of professional studio work. They also decided to step up in a hands-on producer capacity, though still keeping studio wizard Steve Fisk around for his expertise. Ex-drummer Brandt Sandeno and Quasi drummer Janet Weiss add keyboards and vocals, respectively. But apart from bringing in the Pacific Northwest all-stars, having a studio of their own has seemingly afforded Unwound unlimited time to see every idea out to its end. Unfettered by the usual studio pressures, the band packed much more instrumentation than usual into the songs. Leaves Turn Inside You is much too massive and sprawling an album to discuss track by track. There aren't really any bubbly or anthemic songs (such as Fake Train's ""Dragnalus"") or anything of the throat-shredding screams Trosper is well-known for (like on The Future of What's ""Here Come the Dogs""). The length of the album is somewhat mind-numbing, as is the relatively slow tempo of most of the songs. But any loss in kinetic energy is more than made up for by the august musicality of the songs, as well as the sort of dream logic that pervades the album from beginning to end, effected with surreal vocal effects and keyboard atmospherics. The funny but disconcerting animated piece by Zak Margolis (aka Drowning Boy) and the video short by Slater Bradley are great but, ultimately, just the icing on an incredible album. To be truthful, my first listen to Leaves Turn Inside You was a bit difficult; I wasn't even particularly sure that I liked it. I haven't been able to oust it from the stereo since. I'm convinced that, if you've been following this band's development, the initial bewildered expression on your face will give way to total enchantment, and this new, boldly different Unwound album will have you in its grip for months to come.","What the fuck?: the one question any great album should elicit from you,\n\ involuntarily, like a musical doctor's ...

Psychopharmacology,Firewater,by: Jonny Pietin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda75e6ef959693230d3/1:1/w_160/d7189907.gif,2001-04-17 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3070-psychopharmacology/,JetsetJetset,"There are some records whose awesomeness can only be measured in a very special way: on the Patented Personal Performance Listener Fantasy Scale. Basically, if an album, or even a particular song on it, can inspire me to fantasize myself performing it, it is automatically awesome. If the fantasy involves singing the song as a kiss-off to my high school (which I graduated from over a half-decade ago) and the people in it, then I know that, while it's still an awesome song, its shelf-life is short, as high school fantasies are usually only good for a quick, angry masturbation session. If the fantasy takes place in the present day, with me as a band member in a club I'm familiar with, then I know the song has staying power, because that fantasy still has a chance of coming true. One of the first song-fantasies I had that didn't involve those cheerleaders who now worshipped me was with Firewater's ""I Still Love You, Judas,"" off their last record, The Ponzi Scheme. That daydream involved a rehearsal space, a recording studio, and accomplished backing musicians who were very impressed by my raw, yet focused, musical talents. The songs just poured out of me-- the drama burned a hole in my chest and climbed out, and bile poured out of my eyes like tears. I was a brilliant, untapped suburban prodigy. And my Judas would want me back. The rest of The Ponzi Scheme was pretty good, but none of the other songs put me in a state of ecstasy like ""Judas."" What was so good about it? Well, there were the slow-build verses. There were the phlegmy guitar hooks. There was Tod A.'s prison laundry spoon-shiv pipes. And there was that chorus. My God, that chorus. So huge, it was. Transcendence as a liquor-soaked biblical-sized ""fuck you."" So how could Firewater make me like their new album? Well, they could just take the elements that made ""I Still Love You, Judas"" my bloody-toothed grin of a fantasy, and reassemble them ten times. Did they do that? Well, eight times. And that's more then I could have hoped for. Each one of the first eight tracks on Psychopharmacology is a pureblood home run; the title song rides in on the keyboard riff from Three Dog Night's ""One,"" and rides out on a cloud of crushed prescription pills; ""Car Crash Collaborator"" looks at the world through the eyes of Edward Norton's Fight Club character if he'd had a phalanx of bitchin' horns backing him up; and ""Get Out of My Head"" makes me the premier rock star of my inner world. What's weird about my ""Get Out of My Head"" fantasy, though, is that I imagine myself fronting a band featuring my brother on lead guitar and my sister on keyboards. A family-oriented rock star fantasy is something I've never had before, yet in this album's case, it seems strangely appropriate. Psychopharmacology has largely abandoned the exotic forays into Eastern European traditionalism that characterized the first two Firewater efforts, and to good effect. This record brings everything home that has ever made this band any good: (1) The big, poppy choruses; (2) Fabulous melodrama; and (3) A sense of family. That's right, family. This band had previously been a rag-tag collection of Tod A. collaborators, hanging out and helping him achieve his musical vision. On Psychopharmacology, however, for the first time, there is a real, solid Firewater lineup, where everyone is comfortable. And it feels that way. Just like the way I feel with my siblings. For staking out new ground on my Patented Personal Performance Listener Fantasy Scale, this record gets mucho points and praise. You may not hear a better pop/rock release this month. And you definitely won't find one that will make you want to play make-believe more. Thanks for your time. Now, I've got some serious pretending to get to.","There are some records whose awesomeness can only be measured in a very special way: on the Patented Personal Performance ...

Surviving the Quiet,Seafood,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3889d034d5c69bf2e47/1:1/w_160/7ecbca59.gif,2001-04-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7043-surviving-the-quiet/,Big Wheel Recreation,"Initially, I had trouble remembering where I'd heard the name of the London four-piece Seafood before. It probably wasn't from their cover of ""Levitate Me"" on Invisible Records' obscure Pixies tribute disc. Nor was I likely to have noticed their chart activity, which barely cracked the top 100, maxing out in the low-to-mid 90's. Could it have been at that sweaty, word-of-mouth London gig back in 1997, around the time when they first splashed on the scene? Unlikely, since I've never been out of America. Maybe I was wrong. Perhaps I hadn't heard their name before; perhaps, I'd just heard their music many years ago when it was being released under their variety of pseudonyms: Sonic Youth, Pavement, Sebadoh, Dinosaur Jr. Actually, I'm just playin'. (Word.) Certainly, I was familiar with this English quartet from the barrels of ink that have been poured for them in the British music rags. The attention they're getting is verging dangerously on ""hype."" Since they're on the Boston-based indie Big Wheel Recreation (and prior to that, the underachieving Fierce Panda label), Seafood is likely receiving this comprehensive coverage on their own merits, rather than being run through the corporate rock marketing machine with its army of sleazy, bribe-happy footsoldier-promoters. The band's debut full-length, Surviving the Quiet, confirms this hypothesis, but strangely. Seafood is a band out of time, born too late-- more suited to a movement an ocean away and a decade removed than any sort of shared attitude with their contemporary countrymen. They give Britpop a wide berth and a wary eye, and instead favor the good old American guitar band sound. They sound like a group who, as kids, first learned to play their instruments to Pavement CDs instead of Beatles records. (Man, I bet that makes Malkmus feel really old). Brits enamored of American rock pioneers is nothing new; it's a tradition as old as popular rock music itself. But think back-- some good stuff has come out of that national obsession. ""Blech,"" you're saying. ""Why do I want to listen to rehashed, second-rate wannabes?"" Wait, friend. The good news is that Seafood isn't half-bad at their unabashed, on-the-sleeves, tribute band routine. When was the last time you really, honest-Abe enjoyed a Dinosaur Jr album instead of just believing you were supposed to? Better yet, when was the last time you made some sort of Grumpy Gramps statement like ""[mumble mumble] just don't [mumble] like they used to?"" Seafood are part voodoo alchemist and part doppelganger, resurrecting not only the style of our favorite dead and washed-up pre-grunge college radio giants, but also, in part, their substance. ""Belt"" is an impressive use of dynamic range, with the now-familiar-to-all subdued/explosive technique. ""Guntrip"" possesses a swirling, noisy aggression, but with a healthy, cathartic undertone. Kind of like therapy, as opposed to rage. Singles like ""Easy Path"" and ""This is Not an Exit"" are dead-on radio whores that will stick in the heads of millions like peanut butter-flavored taffy. Of course, Seafood have their softer side, too-- evidenced by gentle nods to Nashville in the slide guitar-rich ""Dear Leap the Ride"" and the folky, melodic ""Beware Design,"" intimately sung by drummer Caroline Banks. Surviving the Quiet won't win album of the year; it will just win fans. It won't influence others; it will only preserve its own influences, uncorrupted. Seafood is the kind of band that, in a small but significant way, renews hope. They make you feel like the music you used to enjoy is still being made by someone who loved it just as much as you did.","Initially, I had trouble remembering where I'd heard the name of the London four-piece Seafood before.

Cassidy,Bows,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36a9d034d5c69bf2dff/1:1/w_160/a4a64d22.gif,2001-04-16 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/890-cassidy/,Too PureToo Pure,"May 2, 2001, Newbury Comics, Newbury Street, Boston It's a mild, sunny day, the air pregnant with a spring delayed in coming, but now in full swing. It's perfect for strolling the bustling city sidewalks, but my geekiness has drawn me inside my favorite record store, even though I have no cash. Having no cash is a common disposition for me, so this has become a bit of a pastime. Walk in, marvel at all the stuff I could blow my next measly paycheck on, and walk out, swearing that I'll be back, all Schwarzenegger style. On this particular day, I am idly browsing through the import new release section of the store when I notice Cassidy, the second album from the Scottish trip-hop collective Bows. I thought it would never come out. Too Pure put off two separate release dates, and Bows ringleader Luke Sutherland is not only currently editing his second novel, but he's simultaneously writing his third. I reach for the disc with the lust that only a hopeless music nerd could have for a disc made of plastic. The song titles are alluring: ""Blue Steeples,"" ""Ali 4 Onassis,"" and ""Man Fat."" ""Cuban Welterweight Rumbles Hidden Hitmen"" sounds like a British tabloid headline. The first Bows album, 1999's Blush, was a masterstroke of dark, breakbeat-driven orchestral majesty, one of those ""changed the way I listened to music"" albums. Plus, Sutherland has been doing time in Mogwai on the violin, and his former band, Long Fin Killie, are an old favorite. But, like I said before, I have no cash, and the $25 price tag is telling me to wait for a domestic release. ""I'll be back,"" I whisper, before heading outside. May 7, 2001, Newbury Comics, again I've come back to check on my quarry. Has someone else snatched it? No, it's still there, taunting me. I'm beginning to notice that the artwork isn't nearly as impressive as the translucent bug-woman from the cover of Blush, but I still give in and buy the album in a reckless display of wanton credit card abuse. Screw the domestic release! It's been haunting me for almost a week, after all. May 12, 2001, my dorm room, Boston It's sitting there on my desk, but I haven't listened to it yet. That's really unusual for me. I've been known to get five CDs in a single night and listen to them all straight through. I've read the partially printed lyrics about a dozen times. Still, I'm nervous, anticipating something brilliant, but also fearing the let-down of something that's not quite up to par. The lyrics are great, but that's no surprise from an award-winning author. I grit my teeth and push play. I'm greeted by the sound of swelling electronics and violins, artificially modulated up and down for a woozy effect. Over Howard Monk's huge John Bonham drums, Signe Høirup Wille-Jorgensen's voice enters, sleepy and wasted, like Liz Frazer on a bucket of quaaludes. The effect is something like Blush's ""Speed Marina,"" only warmer and less distinct, not to mention drowning in a sea of drums. Satisfied that it's at the very least not going to be a complete disappointment, I settle in for the long haul. Wille-Jorgensen and Sutherland somnambulate their way through ""Cuban Welterweight,"" a ramshackle featuring only Sutherland's lazy guitar and Wille Jorgensen's half-whispered vocals. Some amazing imagery comes in through the lo-fi haze: ""I flattened an African/ They said, 'Win and we'll whack you'/ So I break out the back way/ Head for the highway and home/ Honey-like sunlight/ I can't cry for laughing/ Trip over two hitmen asleep in a rosebed."" Boxing is a recurrent theme on Cassidy, as the lyrics overflow with the violence, tragedy, and seething sexuality that Sutherland has perfected as his stock-in-trade. On the musical front, the record trades in subtlety, steadfastly avoiding the grand gestures of Blush and the noisy outbursts of Long Fin Killie's three albums. Sutherland also sadly avoids a lot of instrument switching, leaving the sax squalls of old out in favor of guitar, machines, and the very occasional violin. He waits until the fourth track to showcase his own vocals, as well, deferring to Wille-Jorgensen and Ruth Emond more often than not. While both are amazing singers, it's still nice to hear Sutherland's own voice singing his words. There's a certain bite to every syllable he spews, and his bubbling aggression can make a good song fantastic. ""Ali 4 Onassis"" is the album's best track, with its loping beats and shimmering treatments. Sutherland's voice wraps around the refrain and carries it safely to your inner ear. This is followed by the impressive ""Uniroyal,"" a collage of swirling music boxes, skittering percussion and harmonizing vocals that recalls some of Long Fin Killie's best moments. Former Long Fin Killie bassist Colin Greig even shows up here and there to provide a little low end. As the closer, ""Sun Electric,"" fades slowly away, I consider what I've just heard, but am briefly interrupted by the hidden track, ""Ten Ton All the Way Home."" Overall, I'm mildly impressed. I put the disc on the shelf and head to bed. June 5, 2001, My house, Connecticut, 7:00 am, before work I'm eating a bowl of Rice Chex when it suddenly occurs to me that Pitchfork overlord Ryan is going to come calling for reviews on Wednesday night. That gives me a day. I walk into my music library (that's my bedroom) and there it is, calling to me. I've listened to it a few times since May, but I haven't become attached to it like I have Sutherland's other work. Besides, I need a CD or six to take to work-- my job requires music. It's one of those deals that a trained ape could just as easily handle, and is mind-numbingly boring as a result. And you know what? Entering data into a computer is suddenly a whole lot more enjoyable. Despite its focus on subtlety and dry percussion sounds, Cassidy wraps around you like a warm blanket when you get it loud enough to surround you. It doesn't live up to its predecessor like I'd hoped, but it's still a very satisfying statement from a true master. Cassidy may never see release in the states at this rate, but it's still worth picking up if you're a fan of Sutherland or trip-hop in general. Even when he's not totally consistent, the result can still be staggering. If it ever does surface over here, I advise you to give it a go. And if you don't like it, there's always Blush to fall back on.","May 2, 2001, Newbury Comics, Newbury Street, Boston

Old Ramon,Red House Painters,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a22a5e6ef9596932035d/1:1/w_160/7d0a000c.gif,2001-04-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6713-old-ramon/,Sub Pop,"I hadn't been home more than a minute when a bird flew into the bay window of my kitchen and fell to the wooden deck, where it lay crippled on the brown-stained boards in the midday sun. Since these moments seem to wait for me, holding fast until I'm around to witness them, I didn't panic. Instead, I did what I always do: assess the situation and appraise the severity of damage. Unable to get a decent angle on the bird from the window, I stepped out onto the deck in bare feet and abruptly leapt back inside, feeling as though I'd just stepped on hot coals. Its head was all wrong, turned around at an unnatural angle, and its legs were buckled beneath its stout, rust-colored breast. For some reason, I thought of hockey-- specifically of when, as occasionally happens, a defenseman lines up an unsuspecting player skating across mid-ice with his head down. These situations often end with a bloody face to the burning-cold ice, the rest of the body limp. Every movement is slow and brief and seemingly involuntary. This bird moved its neck in much the same way. But you pity the bird over the hockey player because of its lack of understanding. It never knew it was in danger. The bird--a sparrow, thrush, warbler?-- offered little resistance as I scooped it up. Its legs kicked, a wing flapped, but that was all. By the time I laid it down beneath a nearby tree, it had righted its head, although it showed few signs of being able to walk, let alone fly. And still, despite all this, I would soon forget about the bird, remembering it only after it disappeared. But as it lay there among the fresh mulch and old tree roots, I couldn't help but have a paradoxical American Beauty moment, transfixed by the sadness and beauty of this injured animal. I have a similar experience every time I listen to the Red House Painters, for lead singer/songwriter Mark Kozelek can be as emotionally raw and direct as nature itself. Over the course of five albums between 1992 and 1996, he composed melancholy acoustic strains and electric drones in which he sang mournfully about anger, sadness, and loss. Kozelek wrote the same song over and over again with mind-numbing consistency, compelling you to either face him and his personal truths or live in denial. Once he held your gaze, you couldn't look away. And yet, once the music ended, you were strangely free of his grasp. The sound of the bird's beak against the glass still rang in your ears, but all that truly remained were a couple feathers and faint oil streaks on your kitchen window. With 1996's Songs for a Blue Guitar, a Kozelek solo album in thin disguise, he expanded his sound beyond the well-traveled passive-aggressive territory to just plain aggressive territory with a few bona fide rock songs. And now, with Old Ramon, he's taken it step further. If you're wondering why it took five more years to do so, then you haven't heard one of the more harrowing album-on-the-shelf stories of our time. A full retelling here would be redundant-- Pitchfork alone has already written it more than five times. So here's the short of it: Old Ramon was recorded in the fall of '97 through the spring of '98, but was tied up in contractual obligations when Island Records imprint Supreme was axed amidst a slew of cutbacks and mergers. Since then, Kozelek's produced a John Denver tribute album, appeared as the Stillwater bassist in Almost Famous, and released two lackluster acoustic solo albums, one of them comprised solely of AC/DC covers. There's a split-second moment at the beginning of the opener, ""Wop-A-Din-Din,"" when it seems the change is drastic. A loud drumkick ignites a whirl of thought: is this album going to be loud, heavy... upbeat? Not at all. You realize this as soon as the familiar acoustic strumming comes in. Kozelek croons, ""She's got the green eyes/ And the long Egyptian face/ She moves across the floor/ At her own pace/ When we're here in bed/ She'll jump up on my chest/ And when we lock eyes/ There's so much love I wanna cry."" It seems like the same old Kozelek, especially when he sings about ""knocking her around,"" until you realize it's about his cat. But when choir-like backup singers chime in on the chorus, it becomes apparent that things are indeed different this time around. Old Ramon only improves from there. ""Byrd Joel"" begins acoustic, then builds into a rock song with a mid-tempo drumbeat and a non-stop, fuzzed-out bass. When, on ""Void,"" Kozelek sings, ""Fill the void in me now/ Make it up to me, girl,"" a two lofty guitars join to make a potentially desperate song sound downright optimistic. The 8\xBD minute Big Star rocker ""Between Days"" may well be the band's hardest song to date. ""Michigan,"" with its pedal steel and trotting percussion, is a Neil Young-inspired country knee-kicker. And the 11-minute epic, ""River,"" features a few raucous guitar solos that don't seem at all out of place. Even their trademark acoustic numbers-- the Denver tribute, ""Golden,"" and the excellent closer, ""Kavita,"" for instance-- are among their best work to date. Many slower outfits-- Low, American Music Club, Codeine, et al.-- are sometimes pinned with the theory that if you've heard one of their albums, you've heard them all. Such is no longer the case with the Red House Painters. At over 70 minutes with just ten songs, Old Ramon-- named after a Spanish children's book-- might seem a tad overlong, but it actually enhances the experience. With so many previous albums filled to the brim with sad, low-key songs, it's hard to tell if the sonic and lyrical changes are what make this album so compelling. But one thing's for sure: Old Ramon isn't that ailing, grounded bird. It's that same bird finding new life and flying off.","I hadn't been home more than a minute when a bird flew into the bay window of\n\ my ...

Roomsound,Califone,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4db13d1975652138ded/1:1/w_160/de54b913.gif,2001-04-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1236-roomsound/,Perishable,"There's something elemental about Califone. The ideas are fragmented but fundamental. Gravity, blood, warmth, pain, dirt, desire, and decay-- this is the stuff of this band. Not surprisingly, it never crosses my mind that Tim Rutili's songs might be ""too personal"" for me to understand; on the contrary, I hear in this music an impressive representation of some weird collective dream that I can take part in. In some ways, I think of Califone more as a mode of perception than a band. When I had a chance to speak to Tim Rutili a few years back, I asked him what he'd been listening to recently. I knew that Califone had played some shows with Oval, and I was curious to know if he was digging any of the experimental ambient stuff that had then just started to intrigue me. The first two things he mentioned were the Anthology of American Folk Music box set and Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes. I understood that while he had an interest in technology, nothing was more moving to him than a good song. With each Califone release, this lean approach becomes more apparent, as the left-field sonic experimentation of the last Red Red Meat album and the first EP give way to earthy textures and a reverence for simplicity. Califone's first full-length, Roomsound, further solidifies this position. The few tunes that don't feature an acoustic guitar front-and-center highlight piano instead, and the focus is squarely on the songs. Given Rutili's lyrical foundation in disjointed mythology, this more grounded approach is a nice fit. Even more importantly, the craft behind the songs gives them enough muscle to stand on their own. ""Trout Silk"" sets the tone for the album from the first clipped strum. The title gives an idea of what I'm talking about when I speak of the symbols at the heart of Califone: two strong words with clear associations that, at first glance, don't seem to belong together. But then I let my subconscious take over: could trout silk be that iridescent film that coats the edge of a filet, binding the muscle to the skin? It's a rich image that suits the song, a weary folk lament with dark shadings. The only percussion is a muted kick drum, and a bit of guitar distortion fills the spaces between the acoustic picking. ""Bottles and Bones (Shade & Sympathy)"" is where Rutili indulges his pop gifts, as he smiths a chorus hook strong enough to hang a deer carcass on. What really quickens the pulse on this amazing song are the distant background vocals, simple ""oooo's"" that sound like a chorus of ghosts humming along with the changes. As one of the more rock songs on , ""Bottles and Bones"" recalls the finest moments off Bunny Gets Paid. Califone's gradual incorporation of simple keyboard patterns has been a welcome development over the last two records. ""Tayzee Nubb,"" is a downcast song that feels somehow more urban than most of the songs here, possibly because it foregrounds the vaguely cocktail-styled keys. Also, the Brian Deck studio manipulations make themselves known here, but as with the bulk of the record, the effects are played down. Though I've always enjoyed the junkyard orchestra sound he's perfected, I have to admit that the subtlety of the processing here feels right. Each of the Califone EPs had one song that absolutely killed me. On the first, it was ""Silvermine Pictures."" The second had ""Electric Fence."" Nothing here quite matches either of those songs for me, but overall, I'd rank this as Califone's most consistent record. Roomsound is a 49-minute movie that consists of one slow pan across an odd, beautiful and ultimately familiar landscape.","There's something elemental about Califone.

Clicks + Cuts 2,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b1c0084474cd0c0c53/1:1/w_160/7e6de5b5.gif,2001-04-07 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1934-clicks-cuts-2/,Mille Plateaux,"Three CDs clocking in at over an hour a piece, 36 different artists from all over the world-- how could I possibly sum up Clicks & Cuts 2 in just 700 short words? There is no way, hombre. But I have an idea; let me just take a suitably minimal approach and sum it up in two: It's excellent. Notice I didn't say, ""It's fantastic."" I reserve that two-word review for Mille Plateaux's Modulation and Transformation 4. That 3-CD set, released in 1999, turned my head all the way 'round when I heard it. This was back when Mille Plateaux had a roster that ranged from the sine wave tones of Ryoji Ikeda to the comparatively thick drill-n-bass of Panacea, from the vast spaciousness of Terre Thaemlitz to the microscopic fixations of Curd Duca. What an incredibly varied field of music that comp contained, something for the curious in every subgenre of experimental electronics. No, Clicks and Cuts 2 can't quite compare to that. Notice also that I didn't say, ""It's okay."" That was my two-word assessment of the first Clicks + Cuts compilation, released at the time that Mille Plateaux realized there was a revolution afoot, and that it had done as much as any other single label (if you include their associated Force Inc and Force Trax imprints) to set it in motion. That compilation was not a statement about the label per se, but a presentation about a very narrowly defined permutation: the world of glitch techno. The variety the label is known for wasn't relevant to that particular statement, which explains why artists who'd released brilliant work on Mille Plateaux (Gas, Thaemlitz, Oval), but didn't fit in with this aesthetic were omitted. Clicks & Cuts 2 far surpasses its predecessor, primarily because this compilation is open to a much greater variety of sounds. The focus here, in both the music and the MP-standard expository liner notes, is on making music from botched transmissions. A fine image from the liner notes comes from Philip Sherburne, who says, ""The pearl is an error, a glitch in response to impurity."" He's right, of course. A shard of something winds up inside the shell of an oyster and the creature goes to work on it, smoothing out the harsh edges to avoid irritation of its muscle. To my ears, it's not so far from this image to the music of Jan Jelinek (who chips in here with an incredible track called ""The Videoage [re-edit],"" possibly a remix of ""Rock in the Video Age,"" though it sounds new to me). Unlike the first volume, not all the tracks are minimal; in fact, the rhythms and styles are all over the place. Hell, to my ears, a good percentage of the music here even borders on pop, with relatively conventional melodies and instrumentation. Here is a true blueprint for one possible music future, not the dry, academic lecture that was the first Clicks + Cuts compilation. In addition to summing up the glitch genre thus far for the acolytes, Clicks & Cuts 2 also serves as a perfect introduction to this world. It's accessible, and yes, even fun (you just know if Matmos is invited to the symposium there are going to be a few giggles). I have to think anyone with open ears would find something here to love. Take Frank Bretschneider's ""Walking on Ice,"" for example. Though it does indeed have a few snaps and pops, this track is, in fact, a dead ringer for Boards of Canada! It would be impossible to imagine such a warm, snaking synth melody and hip-hop inspired beats fitting in with earlier incarnations of the Mille Plateaux theory. It's applying the glitch to the song, which seems a natural progression. Coming from another sphere completely is Austrian guitar genius Fennesz, who contributes ""Menthol,"" a jittery dissection of processed harmonics with gurgling melody bubbling beneath. It's the kind of track that seems completely random at first blush, but reveals careful, intricate patterning upon closer listening, and it makes me salivate for his latest Endless Summer. Of course, there's not a 4/4 rhythm in sight. The ever-mischievous DAT Politics offers the distorted, fucked up (but funky!) bubblegum tune, ""Hardwai."" It's like a fax of Alvin the Chipmunk stuck in a blender with Alan Sutherland and uploaded to a Linux server. And Rude Solo gets all toyland electro with the fantastic ""Tight,"" complete with a killer vocal sample, not at all far from the best of Two Lone Swordsman's Tiny Reminders. There are, of course, a fair number of 4/4 techno bits with clicks and so forth-- this isn't a complete departure from the first collection. But these tracks, which can seem ho-hum when stacked back to back, blend nicely with the more experimental work (the choppy beat static by Thomas Brinkmann on ""0100"" is particularly striking) and the aforementioned poppier material. The sequencing is exceptional, the tracks first rate, and the working thesis of the label is becoming clearer. Clicks & Cuts 2 is a vital compilation that shows where this strand of electronic music has been and where it might go.","Three CDs clocking in at over an hour a piece, 36 different artists from all over the world-- how could ...

Beautiful,Fantastic Plastic Machine,by: Richard M. Juzwiak,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd47c0084474cd0c2c7a/1:1/w_160/3c523d62.gif,2001-04-03 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2986-beautiful/,Emperor NortonEmperor Norton,"This 80's revival is getting out of hand. What concerns me is not so much the imminent mass hair-feathering, or indie rock's return to new wave, a genre that hardly seems viable enough to warrant re-visiting. The thing that gets me is that, in 2001, we're already immersed in the penultimate decade-- I mean, really, this shit has to last. Because we suffer from culturally encoded attention spans, our love of the 80's simply won't last the entire decade. So what then? Will we turn to the 90's for inspiration again in 2006? I don't even want to think about it. Regardless of the implications of our accelerating retro-pace, it's at least benefiting Tomoyuki Tanaka. The man behind Fantastic Plastic Machine comes off as an innovator on his third album, Beautiful. Because the former fashion designer and his music have, thus far, proven themselves to be invested in style above anything else, the flagrant signifying of early 90's Chicago house on Beautiful could easily be taken as shrewd trend forecasting. And that's exactly what Beautiful would be examined, portrayed, and dismissed as in this review, if it weren't the cohesive, engaging, and yes, often gorgeous album that it is. Instead of assuming the role of semi-successful musical dilettante for a third time, Tomoyuki Tanaka works mainly with one genre (house), and marries the string-laden aesthetics of pre-disco era Philly soul with radio-friendly Windy City bumps. Myriad critics have compared his songwriting on previous efforts to Bacharach, but I've always thought this an overstatement for a guy who'd never really shown himself as more than a sound sculptor of Japanese pop. Beautiful's equal emphasis on melody and production, though, marks a new level of sophistication that finally makes Tomoyuki Tanaka worthy of the analogy. The practically inspirational ""Beautiful Days"" is a duet that benefits from a strong main melody and sashaying keys, which carry the minimal production. The song evokes the work of the underrated, oft-forgotten Chicago DJ Steve ""Silk"" Hurley, right down to the strident string flourishes. ""On a Chair"" temporarily eschews the house sound, as Tomoyuki Tanaka lays down a hip-hop beat, a strong funk bassline, and manipulates a sample of people singing ""ah"" into an infectious tune. As with previous efforts, the album's lone cover is also a highlight. This time around, the Machine offers an incredible, eight-minute remake of Frankie Knuckles' late-night house classic, ""The Whistle Song."" The track is reworked into light samba, with murmur-sized house beats punctuating the Latin sway. A flute improvs over the percussion, this time only intermittently; a small chorus sings the wordless melody instead of the ""whistle."" What makes the song even more sublime is the breezy female voice that rises out of the track for wordless improvisations. Like Beautiful's other Brazilian-influenced house track, the almost-as-gorgeous, 7\xBD-minute ""Todos os Desejos,"" ""The Whistle Song"" never strays from its initial groove, and presents only subtle changes. The song's lengths might be best suited for the dancefloor, but it's unlikely that the intricacies would be picked up without listening to the music on headphones. Still, Fantastic Plastic Machine isn't exactly revising house as an ""intelligent"" genre-- however skilled he is, Tomoyuki Tanaka could never be considered a genius, much less a divine producer capable of transubstantiation. It's even possible that his ""hearkening back"" to the early 90's could just be culture lapping him and making him seem relevant again. If that's the case, and my initial interpretation is indeed faulty, Beautiful is even more successful. That the archaic should sound this fresh is at least a mini-miracle.","This 80's revival is getting out of hand. What concerns me is not so much the imminent mass ...

The Swimming Hour,Andrew Bird,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b25e6ef95969320493/1:1/w_160/6407515d.gif,2001-04-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/712-the-swimming-hour/,RykoRyko,"Milk, sugar, salt, butter, water, yeast, and flour are separate ingredients, each with their own distinct identity. It would be hard for anyone familiar with any one of the given materials to confuse butter with salt, or yeast with milk. But if a skilled cook takes these ingredients and mixes them in the correct proportions, they cease to exist separately from each other. It's no longer, milk, sugar, salt, butter, water, yeast, and flour; instead, it's bread and you can eat it without ever realizing what went into making it. Even with a bad cook, only a pocket of flour or a concentration of yeast will stand out as a rude distraction. Andrew Bird is a consummate cook. His ingredients are a bit different-- 20's hot jazz, garage rock, 60's pop, soul, blues, and classical, among others-- but he treats them as a cook would ingredients for bread, mixing them in the right proportions and emerging with his own distinct end product. Where previously he was a stylist, Bird has evolved into an impressive chemist. The Bowl of Fire's first two albums traded in a very traditional brand of old jazz and turn-of-the-century popular song styles, and his collaboration work with the venerable Squirrel Nut Zippers has been firmly rooted in the pre-World War II decades. Here, he takes a quantum leap forward, wrenching his sound out of the 20's and scattering it through the various garages of the last four decades. Right from the first couple of reverb-heavy guitar notes that announce the opener, ""Two Way Action,"" it's clear this is a different ball of wax. Bird & Co. quickly get things moving, adorning the song's garage rock chassis with some subtle backward guitar and virtuoso flights of fancy on the violin. ""Core and Rind"" is a thunderous, Donovan-inspired commentary on modern psychology and the accompanying drugs, with Bird accusing his analyst of being utterly clueless. ""Why?"" is a stroke of genius, a smoky blues with an ace melody and a weird Screamin' Jay Hawkins-style vibes backing courtesy of the Autumn Defense's Pat Sansone. The scorching hook, ""Damn you for being so easy going,"" would have provided perfect fodder for the likes of Billie Holliday or Etta James. ""11:11"" follows, featuring a brilliant merging of modern indie pop and Caribbean rhythms with vintage 30's string accompaniment. It's such a bold and successful merging of disparate styles that no amount of explanation could really ever do it justice. This is also the first track where it becomes apparent just how spot-on Kevin O'Donnell's drumming is at every turn. The guy is just incredible, whether he's laying down a wild, tom-thumping rock groove, a rolling shuffle or a subdued swing beat with his brushes. O'Donnell's galloping percussion fuels the runaway train ride of ""Way Out West,"" deftly supporting Colin Bunn's ringing guitars and Bird's dazzling violin tangents. Bird's darkly humorous world view is in full bloom here: ""If I was in an old hotel/ That happened to be on fire/ Maybe I'd jump or/ Maybe I'd reconsider/ And climb a little higher/ Like an oily rag in a dusty corner/ Like a box of matches near an open flame/ I'd jump 18 stories from a burning tower/ Sooner than I'd face this world of shame."" Bird specializes in lyrics that often seem merely quirky at first, but reveal depth when given a bit of thought. ""Waiting to Talk,"" for example, spins some clever imagery: ""Everybody's talking/ Nobody's listening/ Everybody's sweating/ Nobody's glistening."" The humming, revival-type Hammond organ and vibes that underpin the song's story of a recluse lend a creepy, noir feeling and a sense of small-town paranoia. The gentle ""Fatal Flower Garden"" then gives way to the record's most aggressive track, the gritty, muscular blues of ""Satisfied."" The ferocious violin solo and wild rhythms would have made Eric Burdon or John Mayall proud in their respective primes, and here, it's just fun to hear the band flat out rock. ""How Indiscreet"" lives up to its name nicely, another brawling blues rave-up, fleshed out with Stax backing vocals, rampaging drums, a sneering vocal from Bird, and a great Chuck Berry guitar solo. The gloriously noisy conclusion sets you up nicely for the funky, soulful interlude that precedes the closer, ""Dear Old Greenland,"" a big, old-style ballad soaked in dramatic strings and maudlin spoken narration. The lack of irony is utterly refreshing in our cynical new century, and it's one of the things that makes the whole of The Swimming Hour a thoroughly enjoyable listen. And that's where the key to Bird's success lies, really. We're stuck in an age where most bands are either trying desperately to move in new directions, or lowering themselves to pastiche. ""Tributes"" to the past so often degenerate easily into smug hipsterism, but Andrew Bird and his cohorts seem to genuinely feel the music they're playing. Better than that-- they're one of the only bands out there who have decided to treat the whole past as a single body of work to draw freely from, rather than restricting themselves to an era or a style. In the process, they've come up with a killer batch of songs that add up to a sublimely enjoyable whole. A trove of treasures like this comes by only so often, so snatch this one up while you can. You won't regret it.","Milk, sugar, salt, butter, water, yeast, and flour are separate ingredients, each with their own distinct identity. It would be ...

604,Ladytron,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6eabf31b7dc7155d03/1:1/w_160/bb59e8b9.jpg,2001-03-31 06:00:12,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4633-604/,Emperor Norton,"To paraphrase Grace Slick, ""If you can remember the 80s, you never suffered any serious head trauma."" Ladytron remember the 80s very, very well. These youngsters fly the new wave flag and keep feeling fascination, passion burning, love so strong. But Ladytron's musical interests stretch back before MTV, to 70s Bowie, Roxy Music, Kraftwerk and Cluster. They're like an unabridged Encyclopedia of musical Eurotrash with a sharp pop sensibility. And with 604, they've made a fine debut full-length. I had a pronounced tinge of déja vu when listening to 604, but it wasn't the retro sound that made me feel like I'd been here before; it was the fact that three of the songs here were on the band's four-song Commodore Rock EP. Looks like they missed the memo from the Department of Redundancy Department. Don't you hate that? You probably didn't buy Commodore Rock, though, so you're not going to mind the overlap. In fact, if this is the first time you're hearing ""Play Girl"", you'll be damn glad they decided to include it on both their releases. It's an ace pop song that Allen Hunter would have been proud to announce the world premiere of, and it would have sounded great between Nena's ""99 Luftballons"" and ""He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'"" by Bananarama and Fun Boy Three. Great stuff. ""Play Girl"" is sung by Helen Marnie, and with her relaxed, breathy tone, she's definitely the more engaging of Ladytron's two vocalists. ""Another Breakfast with You"" is another great track she fronts, with a fat Moog drone that gives it the feel of early Stereolab. ""The Way That I Found You"" is the third major score for Marnie, with a bouncy, anthemic melody over some dark, Naked Eyes-style keyboards. These three songs approach new wave pop perfection. Mira Aroya is around to give the more ""arty"" tracks a serious Continental flair. Her deep, Bulgarian-accented voice is used both for humor (as with ""Paco!"", where she offers a tour of a department store over a dense electro background) and to provide a dark, gothic element to the background (as on ""Discotrax""). When Aroya and Marnie come together to sing the Kraftwerk homage ""He Took Her to a Movie"", which borrows its melody and hook from ""The Model"", both slip into robotic Ralf and Florian mode with excellent results. Rounding out the album are several instrumentals that range from dreamy computer love ambience (""CSKA Sofia"" could be from the second side of Autobahn) to dense analog synth textures in the style of Add N to (X) (""Laughing Cavalier""). The tracks on 604 are sequenced intelligently and keep this slightly overlong album purring along nicely. Latter-day new wave may be old hat, but there's still room for it when it's done right. Enter Ladytron.","To paraphrase Grace Slick, ""If you can remember the 80s, you never suffered\n\ any serious head trauma."" Ladytron remember ...

A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure,Matmos,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3df5e6ef9596932391b/1:1/w_160/8cbb6a4c.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:11,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5151-a-chance-to-cut-is-a-chance-to-cure/,Matador,"The concept of this album was being discussed long before anyone heard the music: Seven songs, mostly pieced together using sounds recorded during medical procedures. Yes, M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel (the men of Matmos) actually donned surgical masks and brought their DATs into operating rooms to record the sounds of a liposuction, nose jobs, and so on. They then used their computers to shape and process the sounds into actual compositions. The two made a similar stab at high-concept music-making with their second album, Quasi Objects. I owned that one for a time, but ultimately got rid of it because it seemed too reliant on novelty. On that record, the gimmick-- music based on sounds recorded around their home (e.g. whoopee cushions, etc.)-- smothered the music. The test of any conceptual record is how well it stands on its own, removed from the angle. And A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure is a first-rate work, even if you're unfamiliar with the backstory. That said, knowing the concept behind this record adds plenty to the enjoyment. Take ""For Felix (And All the Rats)"", for example. The music alone, which consists of what sounds like Tony Conrad-style detuned string drones and an African thumb piano, is striking and needs no explanation. But when we discover that the track was made using sounds coaxed from an empty rat's cage (Matmos applied a violin bow to the bars to mimic the strings, and then plucked the bars for the thumb piano sound), it adds a rich layer of meaning. As a commentary on innocent life in bondage, it's just as powerful as a photograph of an eyeless monkey in restraints. Both the concept and the execution of ""For Felix"" are brilliant individually, and taken together, the effect is almost overpowering; it's a terribly sad and heartbreaking piece of music. None of the other tracks feature such a strong conceptual coup, but the rest vary from decent to great. When Matmos recorded the sound of the instruments used in laser eye surgery, they were smart enough to realize that the buzzing instrumentation bore a marked resemblance to a Roland 303, and hence, we have the wired electro of ""L.A.S.I.K."" A speech record used to teach enunciation to the hearing-impaired serves as the basis of ""Spondee"", with the perfect elocution of the therapist used as rhythmic counterpoint to a devastatingly funky house rhythm. There are a few horn stabs interlaced with the clubby groove, but the more punchy accents come from a tool used to clean sinus cavities. Which illustrates another reason A Chance to Cut is such a success: It uses a fresh sound palette. If you've spent any time listening to the post-Autechre world of IDM, you're probably aware that most programmers aren't getting everything they should out of Reaktor. All those familiar buzzes, squelches and clicks are starting to wear out their welcome; hearing Matmos work magic with material clearly recorded in the field makes me realize what I've been missing. Sounds provide feelings even when they're not playing melodies-- so much of the art in this kind of music is assembling the basic substance. But if it's melodies you want, Matmos deliver in that department, too. ""California Rhinoplasty"" takes a bleep from some kind of surgical monitor and pitch-shifts it into something hummable, until the song morphs into an ethereal cloud of gentle chords and cutting machines (no doubt buzzing through some nose cartilage). As with the rest of the record, even if you didn't know the song title or the sources, it would still sound great.","The concept of this album was being discussed long before anyone heard the music: Seven songs, mostly pieced together using ...

Agony Part 1,Delarosa and Asora,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8fd13d19756521397b1/1:1/w_160/4ca61751.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:10,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2262-agony-part-1/,Schematic,"Tension is what I crave most in music these days. The quality I'm talking about comes from two conflicting forces exerting influence on a piece of music; I like to focus on the fabric of the sound as it ripples in response to these opposing vectors. Beauty vs. ugliness, chaos vs. order, and melody vs. noise: these are the grudge matches I buy front row seats for, because I want to be the first to hear how it ends. I think this interest in tension is why I've become so fascinated with ""glitch"" music over the last couple of years. Rather than hearing a pretty melody sung by a delicate voice, I want to hear that voice struggling to make its way through a maze of faulty machinery, barely heard above a din of noxious static. To my ears, this multiplies the beauty tenfold, knowing how arduous the journey to audibility can be. The ultimate example for me is Nobukazu Takemura's ""Kepler"" from Scope; Aki Tsuyuko's voice is manipulated in such a way that we'll never get to hear exactly what she has to say, though we can tell from her tone that it needed saying. My favorite track off Kid A is the title song for the same reason. Likewise, My Bloody Valentine's ""To Here Knows When."" These tracks speak to how I think about life. When Scott Herren makes music as Delarosa and Asora, he seems to be shooting for that kind of tension. Agony Part 1 touches on the more abstract end of the glitch spectrum while incorporating some steady beats and drifting ambient passages, which is not far from where Autechre seemed headed with their last couple of releases. The problems I have with this record are similar to those I had with EP7; the tension is undercut to a degree because Herren piles on the dissonance and gives the splendor short shrift. You'll find every digital squelch, fuzz and burp you can imagine on Agony Part 1, but only occasionally will you hear a sound that puts a lump in your throat. There's something to be said for this kind of restraint, and the music here never runs the danger of sentimentality (something that can't be said for Nobukazu Takemura), but I'm a little more of a glutton when it comes to melodic payoff. That said, there are a handful of great tracks here. ""Two Hum"" makes good use of the kind of Reichian vibraphone patterns I thought I was tired of, then mixes them with a drone diced so fine it takes on two pitches simultaneously. The four-part ""Paz Suite"" sounds like Autechre remixing Stereolab (which they have, come to think of it, on the ""Miss Modular"" 12-inch-- it's just what you'd expect). Beach Boys-inspired female vocal harmonies are put through the Pro Tools blender and looped, which adds a poignant feel to the repeating synth pattern. Other tracks have their moments, but seem somehow too stereotypically ""IDM"" and, more to the point, a bit too busy for my tastes. Still, there are fleeting moments of brilliance on Agony Part 1-- enough to make me want to pull up a chair find out what happens.","Tension is what I crave most in music these days.

Dismemberment Plan & Juno EP,The Dismemberment Plan,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a113d197565213aec6/1:1/w_160/5062e3ab.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2336-dismemberment-plan-juno-ep/,DeSotoDeSoto,"Little things often pack a wallop. ""Fun-size"" packages of Peanut M&Ms;, free samples of blended coffee drinks, and dollar bills found lying in rain gutters-- all are sufficiently satisfying treats, but leave you wanting more. Such is the case with this split EP. Clocking in at a mere four tracks over 16 minutes, I'm just not fully satisfied. On the other hand, everything here is top-shelf material I'd be a fool to bitch about. If you're a fan of the Plan, you might already be familiar with their original contribution to this split, ""The Dismemberment Plan Gets Rich"". Not only has it been a live staple for over a year, but it was also-- along with Juno's ""Non-Equivalents"", the other original tune appearing on this split-- released as a seven-inch on the Spanish label BCore a few months back. Luckily, ""Gets Rich"" is one of those rare songs that's so goddamned sweet, you can own a copy of it on both vinyl and CD without even the slightest sense that you're being excessive. I've often heard that ""The Dismemberment Plan Gets Rich"" was heavily inspired by Outkast's ""B.O.B."", and while the boys in the Plan may be as white as albino snowflakes, there are definite parallels. Amidst a frenzy of wacky sound effects, Travis Morrison manages to spit out an amazing barrage of syllables in a rather short period of time. All 18 syllables of the song's opening line, ""In early '95 we finally got the dough to diversify,"" are crammed into two seconds of playtime, resulting in a tongue-to-sound ratio of nine syllables per second. The Plan's other contribution is equally entertaining. Jennifer Paige's disgustingly obnoxious hit single, ""Crush"", was once just another over-produced, teen-demographied contribution to the canon of pop culture by the exalted songwriting team of Goldmark, Mueller, Cosgrove, and Clark. But now, by stripping the track down to its bare essentials, the Plan have recast the song as a sparse, slightly dark love song, while retaining lyrics like, ""See ya blowin' me a kiss/ It doesn't take a scientist/ To understand what's going on, baby."" It registers a little like ""Respect is Due"", but without the crescendos. Fellow DeSoto rockers Juno follow the Plan's lead, contributing one original-- the aforementioned ""Non-Equivalents""-- and a mind-blowing cover of DJ Shadow's ""High Noon"". The former is a prime example of the kind of soaring three-guitar rock the band put forth on their first album, This is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes. The potential of three guitarists in a band has been wrecked many a time by gratuitous soloing and similarly self-indulgent crap (Skynyrd, anyone?), but Juno's Gabe Carter, Jason Guyer, and Arlie Carstens explore the full dynamic range of the sound, making ""Non-Equivalents"" a lush, gorgeous exercise in guitar rock. And if ""Non-Equivalents"" is an impressive track, the way Juno make DJ Shadow's ""High Noon"" come to life is even more so. The energy of a live band simply transforms Shadow's version, making it a thousand times more dynamic, exciting, and energetic than the original version. Taking into account its bargain price, it's hard to think of any good reason not to recommend this EP. It's fast, it's fun, and it features the talents of two of the best independent rock bands going right now. If that isn't worth your six bucks, I don't know what is.","Little things often pack a wallop. ""Fun-size"" packages of Peanut M&Ms;, free samples of blended coffee drinks, and dollar ...

Ease Down the Road,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a7ea9e61561daa4aca/1:1/w_160/9395c1ed.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:08,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/701-ease-down-the-road/,Palace,"Throughout history, prophecy and insight have been regarded as two of the greatest misfortunes that can befall a human being. Wise men and oracles have been almost unanimously portrayed as tortured souls, forced to come to terms with a truth that the average man will barely be able to glimpse over the course of his life. It's hard to say whether Will Oldham possesses any kind of supernatural perceptiveness, but there have been times in his recording career when one has definitely gotten the sense that there's some truth beyond our own comprehension that haunts him. Oldham's voice aches with pure fragility; when he's at his best, it's impossible to tell whether he's on the verge of a complete breakdown or a transcendental revelation. Either way, it's that sense of powerful emotion and understanding just below the surface of Oldham's quavering voice that has made his music so personally compelling. Thus, it follows that Oldham's most intimate recordings have always been his best. On the classic Palace record Viva Last Blues, and his first LP under the Bonnie Billy moniker, I See a Darkness, Oldham's voice seemed to materialize into a palpable presence, a haunting, troubled apparition that, though alarmingly human, seemed to carry with it a supernatural constituent. I See a Darkness was the sonic equivalent of a sublimely beautiful nightmare. A tangible sense of impending doom managed to coexist with a more abstract acceptance of the eventuality of death, resulting in an album that flawlessly expressed near-infinite permutations of the inexplicable relationship between man and death. If I See a Darkness was an album of fear, Ease Down the Road could best be seen as an album of contained joy and resignation. While I See a Darkness was kept at a veritable whisper, and rarely deviated from the sparsest of arrangements, Ease Down the Road is not only Oldham's most fleshed-out work to date, but also his most sonically diverse. The result is a fairly uneven batch of songs that, while sometimes hinting at past glory and the prospect of new musical directions, suffers from a lack of the heart-wrenching melody and intimate delivery that have made Oldham's past records so moving. While only five people (including Will Oldham and brother Paul) played on I See a Darkness, Ease Down the Road is credited to twelve individuals, including David Pajo, Oldham brother and Anomoanon frontman Ned, Chavez's Matt Sweeney, and ""filmmaker"" Harmony Korine. Considering that many of the twelve contributors to the record are credited with three or four instruments, it makes sense that the album would be a much thicker sounding affair than previous outings. Tracks like the album's opener, ""May It Always Be,"" and ""After I Made Love to You,"" begin with relatively sparse arrangements, but develop to include multiple layers of vocals, pianos, and guitars. Both of these songs, like many on Ease Down the Road, vary greatly in quality within the songs themselves. ""After I Made Love to You"" develops gracefully along a fluid bassline and gorgeous melody until a single blast of digital synth destroys the organic feel of the song. ""May It Always Be"" suffers from some more dire faults, most notably the lack of memorable traditional melody that Oldham's record so often benefit from. Like all of Ease Down the Road's less spectacular tracks, the flourishes of sound on ""May It Always Be"" don't seem to have any particular purpose; the expanded sonic vocabulary comes at the cost of economy and purpose, a cost that proves to be unfortunately detrimental. Though a good portion of Ease Down the Road tends to drag, there are a few noteworthy tracks that showcase Oldham's amazing songwriting in full form. ""Grand Dark Feeling of Emptiness,"" a minor-key acoustic ballad, bears a closer resemblance to the songs of I See a Darkness than anything else here, and one of the few worthy of the Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy moniker. ""Careless Love,"" the album's most emotionally powerful track, consists simply of Oldham singing a delicate melody that drifts in and out of falsetto over little more than a few pulsating chords. Of the more fleshed out tracks, ""Just to See My Holly Home"" is by far the most successful-- a sing-along style track that bursts with genuine happiness and blissful surrender. Eight years into his recording career, Will Oldham finally seems to be on the verge of overcoming the curse of the uncannily perceptive; it seems fully possible that in the near future, he'll be able to apply every ounce of his understanding of the human condition to an album of pure merriment and tranquility, rather than fear and darkness. Ease Down the Road is without doubt a transitional record, and as a result, the many new sounds contained within the album don't always mesh seamlessly. But the promise of a new direction for Will Oldham, coupled with the impressive, though admittedly rare high points of the record, more than compensates for any disappointment.","Throughout history, prophecy and insight have been regarded as two of the greatest misfortunes that can befall a human being ...
