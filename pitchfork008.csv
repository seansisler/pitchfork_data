Ape School,Ape School,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e55e6ef95969320742/1:1/w_160/8e5d6bca.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12975-ape-school/,Counter,"Though Ape School is technically a self-titled debut album, it is more accurately described as the sophomore effort of musician Michael Johnson, whose first release, Nonsense Goes Mudslide, came out under his own nondescript name back in 2004. Since he's essentially a solo artist and his sound has not changed significantly, the shift to a band identity seems to be mainly in the interest of pragmatism. (If you search for Michael Johnson in the iTunes store, you will mostly find the work of a soft rock singer/songwriter from the 1970s.) Ape School specialize in jaunty yet hazy psychedelia directly indebted to the Silver Apples, United States of America, and other early innovators of electronic instrumentation. Though many others have attempted to mimic the sound of those classic works, Johnson has the advantage of working with one of the earliest Moog analog synthesizers, which lends his recordings an uncanny air of authenticity. Even if there are telltale signs of modern technology and musical influence throughout the album, nearly all of the songs could pass as vintage tunes. This mostly comes down to the fact that Johnson's affections are very low-key, and that he entirely avoids the sort of self-conscious meta touches that typically characterize each successive wave of psychedelic revivalism. Most often, it seems as though he is simply writing songs to flatter the established strengths of his instrument. Of course, the downside of that approach is that his Moog tones never feel particularly fresh or surprising, even when the sound itself is quite interesting and appealing. As an album, Ape School displays an admirable dynamic range, but it nevertheless has an extremely limited emotional palette. Despite its continuum of melodies and tempos, every track conveys feelings that are indeterminate and passionless, which has a way of making the record as a whole drift by in a blur. To a certain extent, this must be the desired effect of Johnson's compostions-- much of the lyrics indicate indecision and muted emotions, and several tracks deliberately detour into zoned-out reveries. That strategy is most effective in ""Did What I Did"", which starts off as a bouncy British Invasion number before drifting out into a slow mantra over an ambient keyboard hum. Johnson is also successful when he leans hard on groovy percussion, as in the Silver Apples sound-alike ""My Intention"", and the vaguely aggressive ""Deathstomp"". The quality of the songwriting dips somewhat in the album's final third, but there are no outright duds, and it's easy to forgive aimless numbers like ""In Time You Are"" and ""Floridian Grime"" when the record is mostly characterized by the tunefulness of frontloaded highlights such as ""Wail to God"", ""That's OK"", and ""Be an Encore"". In the right mood-- or altered state-- Ape School is a pleasure, but outside of that state of mind, the music can seem somewhat lacking. Johnson's talent is hard to deny, but he could do well to become more ambitious in his arrangements. His tastes in melody, rhythm, and texture are exceptional, but ultimately his work is low on inspiration and originality. Ape School is a respectable album, but it's hard not to wonder if Michael Johnson is capable of doing much more with his skills and equipment than what is evident in these recordings.","This one-man project specializes in jaunty, hazy psychedelia indebted to the Silver Apples and other early innovators of electronic instrumentation.

Colonia,A Camp,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e313d1975652138bb4/1:1/w_160/cbe84bd3.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12973-colonia/,Nettwerk,"""Love is stronger than Jesus,"" Nina Persson will have you believe, and to prove her point, she issues a further challenge to ""bring on the war and diseases."" Now, whether love is stronger than swine flu remains to be seen, but for Persson, it ultimately doesn't matter-- for her, the power of love is measured not by the elation but the devastation. Ever since presenting herself as a model of cheery Scandinavian congeniality on the cover of the Cardigans' Life back in 1995, Persson has played up the ironic distance between her pixie-esque appearance and the emotional unrest stirring in so many of her songs; on her second album as A Camp, the tally of bruised egos and broken hearts practically reaches pandemic proportions. The real irony here is that Persson's husband, Shudder to Think guitarist Nathan Larson, rides shotgun on this trail of rocky romances. Along with co-producer Niclas Frisk, he pushes Persson out of the forest fantasias created by Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous on A Camp's 2001 debut towards a sound that, true to Larson's glam-rock pedigree, is both more regal and urbane. As a solo outlet, the A Camp guise allows Persson to avoid the assumed confessional baggage that plagues so many singer-songwriters performing under their own name. And Colonia's luxuriant presentation makes it easier to imagine Persson as, well, a different person: the medieval mistress sarcastically saluting her ""murderous ass"" of a king on ""The Crowning""; the subservient rock-star groupie on the rollicking ""My America""; or the trophy wife in the acerbic lullaby ""I Signed the Line"" who decides she wants to cash out. And by fortuitous circumstance, ""Here Are Many Wild Animals""-- a study of primal desires cast in a girl-group gloss-- is given extra bite due to the fact the artist it most clearly references, Phil Spector, was recently caged for his own unsuppressed bloodlust. Given Persson's facility as a storyteller, it figures that Colonia's spell is broken whenever she breaks from character. ""Chinatown"", a snow-covered stroll through Persson's favorite New York 'hood, tries too hard to mythologize its everyday scenery, piling on the choral vocals, synthetic orchestration, and Asian guitar accents. And while the meta-duet with Nicolai Dunger on ""Golden Teeth and Silver Medals""-- wherein the two address each other by name and sing about singing a love song together-- has designs on subverting traditional pop-singer pairings, its blustery, spotlight-clamoring chorus essentially renders it a Swedish indie answer to wedding-song standards like ""Up Where We Belong"". But Colonia is mostly careful to use its expanded palette of sounds for subtle shading rather than gratuitous effect. This is particularly evident on the sublime closer, ""The Weed Had Got There First"", a serene piano-rolled promenade in which Persson chronicles a history of let-downs in botanical terms, but the closing passage-- where Persson blissfully la-di-da's along with the string section-- suggests regret is a feeling she's grown accustomed to. And so it is in Colonia's quietest moment that Persson's greatest gift becomes most audible: her knack for passing off disappointment as fulfillment.","The Cardigans' vocalist Nina Persson's second album as A Camp finds her moving toward a sound that's more regal and urbane.

Shout at the Döner,Kid606,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d613d1975652138b99/1:1/w_160/36735037.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12962-shout-at-the-doner/,Tigerbeat6,"At the turn of the millennium, Kid606's name appeared so frequently in post-techno review sections and new release bulletins that it became a little overwhelming, even for those (like your reviewer) whose attention (and record-buying budget) was devoted almost solely to electronic music. It felt like every 606 single or CD was a window onto both a restless post-teen imagination and an American underground violently remaking European electronic innovations, whether brainy or boneheaded. But tastes shift, spending money dries up, life intervenes, shit happens. So caveat emptor: my lapsed fandom means I can't say with any certainty how Shout at the Döner fits into the still dense Kid606 discography as a whole. What I do know is that it's a hell of a lot of fun-- a rough, dirty party album, a trawl through two decades of abusive bass and dancefloor bad taste. Then as now, it's the sort of digi-noise terror mixed messily in firetrap lofts and warehouses with crappy acoustics. On ""Hello Serotonin, My Old Friend""-- nice to see he hasn't lost his way with a punning title-- good ol' mechanical ""Mentasm"" synth effects shriek, eventually swallowed by a chaotic breakdown. But being dance music, rather than fried-circuit free noise, it's the viciously jacking drum track that's the real head-flattener. Make no mistake, Shout At The Döner is a rhythm record. It just takes its programming cues from those foolhardy German and Dutch pioneers who sped Chicago snares and Detroit kicks into a gleefully abusive pummel. Not every track is necessarily as abrasive as ""Hello Serotonin""; a few could even slot onto a quasi-mainstream comp, if not quite your average super-club set. ""You All Break My Heart"" is more-or-less diva house. But even with the noise turned down (just a notch), those R&B ad libs and crashing electro drums can only be described as ""manic."" Like the rest of the best of Shout at the Döner, ""You All Break My Heart"" feels ripped from that moment in any great DJ's set when the audience's screams start to challenge the din coming off the decks and you start eyeballing the exits just in case. This is an album that celebrates a history of hysteria and claustrophobia, of adverse reactions and temple-clutching come downs. A throwback to early 90s dark rave (""Dancehall of the Dead"") even induces tongue-in-cheek panic via a sample of Nick Cave asking dancers ""who wants to die?"" Somewhere a half-forgotten hardcore producer is listening at his day job and kicking himself for not having combed the Birthday Party catalog first. As all of these references to 10- or 15- or even 20-year-old subgenres might suggest, yes, Shout at the Döner will feel mighty familiar to anyone who's spent time exploring the fuglier side of dance, the gabba greats and acid addicts who flayed their black boxes until they cried ""oom"" (or ""onkel""). But call it retro in service of sweat and smiles, celebrating the ridiculousness of dance music at its loudest and most unmannered. To illustrate how little distance separates the frenzy-inducing floor-fillers of 1989 and 2009, the Kid even offers a cheeky ""cover"" of 4 Hero's ""Mr. Kirk's Nightmare"", connecting the grotty hip-house of first-wave rave and the shamelessly cheesy bass wobble of current dubstep. If the recent noisy excesses of the Ed Bangers and Alter Egos of the world left a bad taste in your mouth, Shout at the Döner is not for you. If you're old enough to need earplugs, but also lament dance music's 21st-century slide into gentility, here's a way to relive its dumb-ass glory days in the safety of your home.","Latest from Kid606 is a hell of a lot of fun-- a rough, dirty party album, a trawl through two decades of abusive bass and dancefloor bad taste.

Tinted Windows,Tinted Windows,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d013d1975652138b8d/1:1/w_160/383b4421.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12957-tinted-windows/,S-Curve,"Let's not proclaim the CD dead just yet. Just as there are certain types of music that sound better on vinyl, the clean-room sound of that nearly obsolete silvery disc is the perfect medium for certain styles mostly associated with the 90s alt-rock that coincides with the technology's heyday. It's not an across-the-board pairing, however. Pearl Jam were so into vinyl that they added scratches to Vitalogy. But Stone Temple Pilots: CD. Candlebox: CD. Hanson: CD. Fountains of Wayne: CD. The Smashing Pumpkins: CD (although I imagine they'd be particularly loathe to admit it). Those last three acts are all represented in the new group Tinted Windows. That's middle child Taylor Hanson on vocals. Former Pumpkin James Iha on guitar. Fountain Adam Schlesinger on bass. And on the skins! The one! The only! Bun! E.! Carlos! (Crowd goes same). The drummer is obviously the odd man out here: Not only is he old enough to be the singer's father, but Cheap Trick is old enough to have intimately influenced each of his bandmates, their former bands, and pretty much anyone they ever toured with. Also, Cheap Trick: both vinyl and CD. The result of this collaboration is the kind of polished power pop that was popular and even a little edgy for a brief period during the previous decade, and it's hard to tell if Tinted Windows, with their power chords, studio-sculpted guitars, and terrible name, are hopelessly dated and irrelevant or simply nostalgic for a musical moment before CDs became technology's bitch-- right above cassingles and right below eight-tracks. I was a little disappointed that my copy wasn't sealed with one of those dogbone stickers, the residue of which would remain long after the death of the medium and even the death of me. On the other hand, the second or third best-selling tween act in the country is a power-pop act-- Jonas Brothers-- who take to the genre like a birthright and who really aren't so bad, as far as that sort of thing goes. Is there a market for the style or just for young brother acts? Even if Tinted Windows are riding a revivalist wave, the group's self-titled debut is pretty unsurprising in its pop-rock format, and it may be cynical to think they've polished it up and sanded it down to make it as broadly appealing as possible. Songs open with a snappy riff; catchy choruses follow melodic verses; and the opposite sex is the main subject matter. ""Kind of a Girl"" is the first song on their new album, and arguably the best, showcasing Schlesinger's compact melodies and an interesting dynamic between his bass line and Iha's guitar squall. Spelling out each woah-woah in the lyrics sheet is a nice touch, and a reminder to say good-bye to liner notes. Unfortunately, those may be the wittiest lyrics in the song, whose title promises a character who's not entirely a girl, but just kind of a girl. Instead, Schlesinger, whose pop sensibility once seemed dead-on, writes like he's still on the That Thing You Do set. Tinted Windows is best when the tempo is fast and the momentum relentless, which makes ""Kind of a Girl"" a strong leadoff and ""Can't Get a Read on You"" almost desperately fast. The highlight of ""Messing with My Head""-- the real keeper here-- may be Hanson's performance, which showcases a cool falsetto yelp and subtle growl in his otherwise everyguy vocals. As the pace of the songs slow, the intensity flags and the album sags. The big, midtempo chords of ""Dead Serious"" herald a lackluster chorus, faux-breathless vocals, de rigueur guitar fanfares, and an egregiously unexcitable use of ""hey hey hey!"" Those are all Schlesinger compositions; Iha and Hanson fare worse in the songwriting department: the guitarist's ""Cha Cha"" is a grating Cheap Trick knock-off that should have given the drummer pause, and the singer's ""Nothing to Me"" grafts a pretty mean-spirited kiss-off to a pretty limp hook. But at least neither of them is responsible for the bass player's insipid montage rocker ""Without Love"", whose faux uplift is tempered with moldy pop clichés like ""Without love the nights are so long."" Sure, lyrics aren't as crucial as melody and momentum, but how can you sing along if you're always cringing? Ultimately, the whole of Tinted Windows is so much less than the sum of its considerable parts that it's almost tragic. In playing to pop's imagined past, this quartet neglect the idiosyncrasies that made them such compelling individual artists: the inventiveness of Iha's solo work, the humor and specificity of Fountains, the exuberance of ""Mmmbop"", the sweet escapism of Cheap Trick in the 70s. If there are dollar bins in the future, that's where you'll find this failed debut.","You know who's inside: James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins), Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Bun E. Carlos (Cheap Trick), and Taylor Hanson.

Fate to Fatal,The Breeders,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e4b1335d7bf1698822/1:1/w_160/1f073a8c.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12974-fate-to-fatal/,self-released,"It's my pleasure to kick off a Breeders review without feeling the need to hypothesize as to what the hell took 'em so long. I mean, this time, we know: In the year or so since the fitfully rewarding Mountain Battles, the Breeders have toured some, severed ties with 4AD, and-- in London, Chicago, and Dayton-- laid down the tracks that became their self-released Fate to Fatal EP. And, while you'd be hard up to find anybody who'd ever met ""Roi"" who'll tell you the Breeders hit any kind of artistic peak in this decade, by all accounts, the long periods of infighting and inebriation and, worst of all, inactivity that characterize far too much of their career appear behind 'em. Shucks, the baddest twins in rock have even been biding their time down at the Dick Blick, and the hand-screened covers of the limited vinyl edish of Fate to Fatal will have been touched by at least one Deal, maybe both. As far as the return of the physical record as fetish object, well, you're not gonna do a lot better than that. As far as the record itself, though, Fate to Fatal's just a little lucky it's got all that other stuff working for it. For a four-song affair, there's a lot to talk about before we get into how this music sounds: The packaging, yes, but Screaming Tree/Gutter Twin/hellspawn Mark Lanegan sings one of the tunes, and another's a cover of a Bob Marley cut. When I'm sliding the record out of its delightfully wonky cardboard sleeve, I am one happy sonofagun; I mean, I'm not immune to the charms of a quirky object made just for me and 999 other lucky sods by a band I've cared about for a good decade and a half. Once the needle hits Fate to Fatal, though, my mood swings. Like every other Breeders record before it, Fate to Fatal's opener kills-- though my colleague David Raposa feels otherwise. All brute force and giddy charm, the eponymous leadoff track is the Breeders at their most jarring and most exuberant, with churning power-chords beating out a kinda rhythm for the Deal gals to holler and shout over. But, oh, when they move from a scream to a whisper and back again, does it ever sound good. The Deals singing in tandem make one of the great noises in rock, and when you throw 'em all over a tune this kinetic, this heady, this pleasure-center-smacking, it just couldn't feel more right. Plus, I rather like my Breeders careening and stumbling and anti-produced. Then there's the Lanegan-wheezed ""The Last Time"", on which the very special guest feels genuinely extraneous. It's a pretty nothing-song to begin with, little more than some strumming and a couple of ominous-sounding throwaway lines for the guy to growl and, sweet mercy, some much-needed atmospheric wooze around what I suppose you'd call the chorus. After the headrush of ""Fate to Fatal"", the staid, static ""Last Time"" is a total bringdown. The Breeders have a history with unadorned, Everly Brothers-style harmony-heavy acoustic cuts (covers, often), and their Steve Albini-recorded take on Bob Marley's ""Chances Are"" doesn't stray from the formula much. It's plenty gorgeous, but it's a fairly slow acoustic version of another song, and it's terribly reminiscent of their equally fine take on Hank Williams' ""I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)"" from the ""Divine Hammer"" single and their own ""Here No More"" from Mountain Battles. I could listen to them sing all day, and I'm awfully glad it's not ""Buffalo Soldier"", but it, like so many other attempts at Bob Marley tunes before it, doesn't linger. Fate to Fatal touches down with the spindly ""Pinnacle Hollow"", which, you'll notice, sounds a good bit like a demo. It certainly feels straight from the four track, anyway, and that's good and bad by turns. The analog conception adds a lot of sonic interest to what doesn't otherwise seem like a fully formed idea-- a demo, you know-- but then again, so do a lot of the better Breeders records. That said, it's hard to hold against this one the fact that it merely sounds like the beginnings of a great Breeders track. Though it starts out fluttering, ""Hollow"" settles into an appealingly stoney crawl to it, and the slack, almost bluesy vocal achieves what I suspect Title TK's still-weird ""Sinister Foxx"" was shooting for. As it is, it's intoxicating, but I can't help but wonder what it'd sound like with a bridge. There's almost certainly something to be read into the resigned delivery on a line like ""I don't know a sin I haven't found,"" or the fact that the tune's named for the West Virginny holler where the apparently ailing Mama Deal grew up, but like any Breeders song with a couple-three lyrics and a whole lot of fuzz, it's resistant to easy interpretation. To paraphrase the Deals' fellow rocker Lil Wayne, it feels big, and that's all that has to be said on the matter. I kept coming back to Pitchfork's recent interview with the Deals while grappling with Fate to Fatal; even for a Breeders record and an EP still, it all just feels so casual, but from the song selection to the Lanegan-poaching down to the artwork, it sounds as if that was the idea all along. Casual is a fine look for the Breeders-- even if ""The Last Time"" is a little too casual-- and it's no bad thing to hear them having what sounds like a pretty good time goofing around. Plus, I'm plenty curious how bands big and small are figuring their ways around this batshit music economy we've got going, and for the Breeders-- well aware they're never going to sell a million copies of anything again-- this homespun limited-release coupled with readily available downloads and the possibility for more pressings seems as good a solution as any. Sure, I wish Fate to Fatal were a little more solid down the middle, but to hear Kim and Kelley tell it, it's meant to be an acrylic-slathered curio, odds and also sods, and as such, it's pretty wonderful. Wonderful, too, is that it's arrived so soon; had this been the first Breeders music hitting our ears in plural years, I doubt they'd get by with quite this much. Fact is, three new Breeders songs-- one great, one good, and one I've already forgotten-- and a not-half-bad cover is too nice a change of pace from a whole lotta nothing not to notice. And if nothing else, it'll have you wondering why they couldn't do this sort of thing more often.","The Breeders return (yes, so quickly!) with a four-song EP that features Mark Lanegan and includes a Bob Marley cover.

More Heart Than Brains,Bike For Three!,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3db13d1975652138ba4/1:1/w_160/ad4e7823.jpg,2009-04-28 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12967-more-heart-than-brains/,Anticon,"Musical collaborations across great distances have many challenges. First you have to find ways to keep the energy alive and cohesive without being able to feed off each other on the spot; then there are time differences to negotiate and the natural ebb and flow of personal inspiration and schedules to plan around. With these obstacles in place, it's tough to remain on the same page as your collaborator. So how about when you've never met the musician you are working with? Such was the case for Belgian-based producer Joëlle Phuong Minh Lê (Greetings From Tuskan) and Canadian indie-rap artist Buck 65 when they created their debut album, More Heart Than Brains, under the moniker Bike For Three! (Full disclosure: I contributed a guitar part to a track from Buck 65's Dirtbike Trilogy.) Of course, there are advantages to writing songs this way. Since each presence is designed to motivate the other from afar and relies on an interdependent exchange of surprises and ideas, a clearer mesh of distinct identities can emerge. This is certainly the case on More Heart Than Brains. As it's name reflects, this is a highly personal and tender album, rich with musings on adventure, love, and the mysteries of life. Phuong Minh Lê, an outstanding electronic artist, handled the composition and production, while Buck 65 contributed the lyrics, which run fast and furious through every track with his typically visceral and expressive delivery. Both musicians stand apart-- Buck 65 with his sharp lyrical details and storytelling, and the flinty glitz of Phuong Minh Lê's exquisite, shimmering landscape that rarely plays by the rules as it constantly shifts and dives, resurfacing unpredictably as she throws remarkable textural surprises into the mix. Together they create something very special. ""Nightdriving"", ""Lazarus Phenomenon"", and ""Always I Will Miss You. Always You"", show Bike For Three! at their best as their ideas fuse seamlessly and naturally. A couple of times things fall off track, such as the futuristic, awkward shagginess of ""MC Space"", but it's mostly exciting to hear Buck 65, who has been fiercely productive for 15 years, rise to the challenges set by Phuong Minh Lê. There's something almost voyeuristic in listening to such an intimate musical relationship built on exchanging confidential messages to one another, but it's this warmth that gives the record its spirit. More Heart Than Brains shows that Bike For Three! have plenty of ideas left to mine in the future, whether they meet or not. Perhaps they never will. As Buck 65 sings on ""Let's Never Meet"": ""Let's never meet and regret a past endeavor/ What we have is rare indeed and guaranteed to last forever.""","This Postal Service-style collaboration teams Belgian-based producer Joëlle Phuong Minh Lê and Canadian indie-rap artist Richard Terfry (Buck 65).

On the mic, frontlady Isis is so deadpan you wonder if she even knows it, especially when championing sex and conspicuous consumption with the aplomb of a Top 40 rapper. Producer Grahm Zilla shows off a deep record collection spanning from disco to Detroit techno to old school hip-hop, though his retro rehashing lacks the obsessive enthusiasm of fellow indie rap acts Lupe Fiasco and the Cool Kids. While these factors are likely to scramble your post-everything irony circuits, the sad fact is that Thunderheist lack the artistry for something as nuanced as hipster rap, and they're probably just a broad rap act that's too drab for mainstream success. When your big blogosphere splash is a thugged out take on ""Sweet Dreams"" like Thunderheist's 2007 single ""Sueños Dulces"", you're already standing on pretty shaky ground. On their first full-length, the duo still can't hone a shtick of their own, relying instead on a bland mix of homage and innocuous one-liners. ""Jerk It"" tries to shock in the vein of Peaches or CSS but comes off as polite recommendation, made even more ho-hum by its cadence, which apes Missy Elliot's ""Work It"". Most of Isis's lyrics dwell on similarly obvious and well-examined arguments like ""sex is desirable,"" ""dancing is fun,"" or ""shiny things are nice to own."" Sure, there's ""Freddie"", which gently taunts an aging cokehead, but most of the tracks here seem intended to cheerlead for drunk, horny people already on the dancefloor. Mr. Zilla keeps the album's head above water with a couple electro gems that accommodate the garden variety lyrics. Sparks fly on ""Nothing 2 Step 2"" and ""Space Cowboy"", two searing electro-dance numbers sharing the amphetamine restlessness of Crystal Castles or Vitalic. Closer ""Anthem"" provides too little variation too late, but its Justice-esque arena-techno posturing at least shows glimpses of stronger material to come. Still, with its unchecked endorsement of bull-market indulgence and broad creative strokes, Thunderheist's first offering feels hollow. Isis doesn't shed light on her own character with origin stories or ""my x is better than your x"" braggadocio, and Zilla's literal take on his influences can feel downright algorithmic at times, like a RIYL music app. While this sort of proactive fandom hardly qualifies as bad art, you'd have to get pretty smashed to ignore the album's missing spirit and just dance, which, sadly, may be the point here.","Toronto duo attempt to carry the blogosphere goodwill earned from ""Sueños Dulces"" and ""Jerk It"" over the course of a full album.

Purpleface,Throw Me the Statue,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3df13d1975652138bac/1:1/w_160/d669da3d.jpg,2009-04-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12970-purpleface/,Secretly Canadian,"Maybe you can chalk it up to their unique (awkward) name, but I'm still surprised Throw Me the Statue didn't earn more attention on the strength of their debut LP, Moonbeams. There was just something about it that sounded as though you'd end up hearing it everywhere, but unless I'm shopping in the wrong stores or not earning the right credits from my soft drink purchases or something, I certainly wouldn't consider myself inundated by Throw Me the Statue lately. Reitherman's seemingly easy way around a riff, matched with his ability to casually dart out easily appealing tunes both peppy and not so much-- the same thing that earned the Shins and Death Cab radio play-- and the band's plinky technicolor-twee arrangements really worked together, it did really seem destined for a thousand iPods Moonbeams was not only an assured, promising (if overlong) record, but it sported a couple-three songs as earwormy as anything you see pushing earbuds lately. Still, the closest Throw Me the Statue came to breaking out was their I-sooo-called-it Rhapsody ad, but I bet even members of TMTS didn't quite catch whose song that was. Whatever's in store, it's probably not coming on the back of the disappointing Purpleface EP. At four songs-- one of 'em a redo of Moonbeams' ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly""-- and roughly 16 minutes, Purpleface doesn't nearly go far enough in showcasing Reitherman's budding melodic talent, offering instead a bit more of the bummed-out balladry that bogged down the last third of Moonbeams. When it comes down to it, it's a proximity issue: slowish jam, slow jam, slow jam, slowish jam, and a few too many clunkers in a row for something this slight. Swarming guitars, windowpane-splatter drums, and what sounds to be a mini-megaphone can't save opener ""That's How You Win"" from its own slightness, but the other three tracks here are as tender and troubled-sounding as any of the sleepier moments from Moonbeams. The update of ""Heart Signs"" is fairly unnecessary; somebody thought to replace the spare acoustic plucking of the original with a heavy glaze of orchestration, and the song lives on to tug at another set of heartstrings. ""Honeybee"" is the prize, a buzzy slow-burner with a gauzy, gorgeous instrumental interlude and raspy Reitherman's best vocal performance on wax since Moonbeams' title track. There's a deliberateness to ""Honeybee"" that's lacking in the two other new Purpleface numbers, and it's telling that it's the least adorned track here: There's no need to dress up an already affecting tune. Clattering closer ""Ship"" is awfully pleasant, mercifully picking up the rhythm just a smidge in its midsection. Throughout, though, the performances feel weirdly dispassionate, as if Reitherman and company were treating this like a placeholder EP. And so it is, I suppose. But there's certainly a least a few something elses holding TMTS back a little bit. I think Reitherman's way with the pen is second only to his way around sculpture; he's done some good lyrics in the past, but he certainly didn't dogear anything particularly interesting for Purpleface. Reitherman's got a reasonably nonchalant singing voice, particularly on the slower ones here it seems, and that, coupled with his lyrics, sometimes means the song never quite sticks. The first verse of ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly"" is actually a fairly nice piece of writing, but the second reminds me a lot of Vanessa Carlton, and not the Vancessa Carlton song I like. ""Honeybee"" seems to call for a simple, direct lyric, and it delivers, even when Reitherman's voice seems slightly obscured by the music and his own casualness. ""That's How You Win"" is just overwhelmed with nonsensey phrases spit out without any discernible thread behind 'em, which ends up this weird talky go-nowhere electronic bummer like one of the lesser numbers on R.E.M.'s Up or something. The other songs really are better than that one, but even still, ""Ship"" still doesn't hang in your brain much longer than Reitherman takes to say it. Some of those Moonbeams lyrics were awfully good-- the sad romantic travelogue ""Young Sensualists"" chief among 'em-- but a lot of them, too, took this impressionistic tack sometimes to their detriment. The big difference, of course, is that they were attached to better tunes.","After the almost-breakthrough Moonbeams, Throw Me the Statue return with an EP that explores their more maudlin tendencies.

Touchdown,Brakes,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33f5e6ef959693205df/1:1/w_160/69cda832.jpg,2009-04-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12849-touchdown/,Fat Cat,"In 2002, shortly after forming Brakes as a solo project, singer-songwriter Eamon Hamilton was recruited by another Brighton, UK, band, British Sea Power. Although his duties were predominantly as keyboardist, he was best known for contributing to the group's notoriously hyperactive live shows, during which he often ran wild-eyed into the audience, manically banging a gigantic drum and scaling the stage rafters alongside BSP guitarist Martin Noble. Given his engaging stage presence and appetite for writing swift, sharp songs that reel and rage like sonic blisters, it's not surprising that Hamilton was soon approached by three other staples of the Brighton rock scene: brothers Alex and Tom White of the Electric Soft Parade, and bass player Marc Beatty of the Tenderfoot. This gave a new lease on life to Brakes, as the band expanded the scope of Hamilton's unfussy songwriting while giving it more substance. In 2006, Hamilton amicably left British Sea Power to concentrate on Brakes. Following the release of their 2005 Rough Trade debut, Give Blood, which featured the heated admonishment ""Cheney""-- arguably one of the best nine-second songs ever recorded-- the band went on to release Beatific Visions before signing to FatCat for their third full-length, Touchdown. Like many great punk bands, Brakes have found their formula with a-less-is-more approach. Although their range might seem straightforward at first, it's their decision to intersperse the boisterous blast of songs such as ""Porcupine or Pineapple"" or ""Red Rag"" with the reflective indie pop of ""Isabel"" and ""Crush On You"" that really makes this band compelling and instantly likeable. On Touchdown, they flip easily between the tough racket of ""Hey Hey"", the sparkly indie of ""Worry About It Later"", and the soft country lilt of ""Leaving England"". There is definitely a shift of focus on this album. While Hamilton's lyrical wit, which veers from cleverly biting to absurdly goofy, continues to take center stage, the songs sound more pulled together than ever and injected with an unabashed optimism that suits the music well: ""I was punching the air on this lonely drive/ Singing goddamn I'm happy just to be alive!"" he sings over a chug of distortion on ""Don't Take Me to Space (Man)"". This type of unpretentious, smart, straight-no-chaser rock has been somewhat lacking in British indie music for the last few years, so it's good to hear Brakes pushing all the right buttons. Although only one song passes the five-minute mark, Touchdown overflows with ideas imaginatively sifted from a range of genres, and feels honest, infectious, and personable from beginning to end.","More unpretentious, smart, straight-no-chaser rock from this UK outfit, which includes former members of British Sea Power and the Electric Soft Parade.

A Cabinet of Curiosities,Jane's Addiction,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3da5e6ef95969320729/1:1/w_160/e45efc4a.jpg,2009-04-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12966-a-cabinet-of-curiosities/,Rhino,"Every great rock band has its quiet conscience, the in-house bullshit detector who keeps the band grounded while the egos and bank balances get too inflated, or who knows when to let things be once the thrill is gone. Perhaps not coincidentally, these people are invariably bassists: John Paul Jones in Led Zeppelin, Bill Wyman in the Rolling Stones and, in the case of Jane's Addiction, Eric Avery, who-- not wishing to tarnish the band's trailblazing 1987-1991 legacy-- opted out of lucrative reunion tours in 1997 and 2001. Perry Farrell may have gotten all the ""Alternative Nation""–spokesman plaudits, Stephen Perkins may have gotten all the Modern Drummer covers, and Dave Navarro may have gotten all the Carmen Electra, but Avery was the band's pulse. His brooding, PiL-popping basslines provided the ominous undercurrent that gave depth to the band's glam-metal veneeer. Take him out of the equation, and Jane's veer dangerously close to becoming just another flashy L.A. rock band-- a point driven home by 2003's Avery-less reunion album, Strays, which, fittingly, is survived only by its Aerosmithy single ""Superhero"" becoming the opening theme to flashy L.A. TV show ""Entourage"". Avery's surprising re-entry into the Jane's fold last year is therefore significant-- so much so, it warrants a box-set celebration. The 4xCD A Cabinet of Curiosities-- two CDs of demos/rarities from 1986-91, a third featuring a 1990 live-show recording, and a DVD of assorted video ephemera-- could've theoretically been released at any point in the past 18 years, but the bassist's return provides the band with a somewhat justifiable reason to cash in now, honey. And what a lovely piece of furniture it is: A Cabinet of Curiosities arrives in a wooden, latched-door case, which opens up into a shrine-like assemblage of album and poster art, a thick booklet featuring testimonials from fans like Slash, Flea, and Billy Corgan, plus tarot cards and miniature worry dolls for each member. Leave it to Jane's Addiction-- a band who, at the height of 80s hair-metal, revitalized such hoary, unfashionable devices as goth, funk, proggy dinosaur-rock, and drum circles-- to raise the standard for CD box sets just as the medium is about to die. Unfortunately, all that elaborate packaging can't mask the fact there aren't very many curiosities to uncover here. As previous odds'n'sods collections Live and Rare and Kettle Whistle attested, Jane's didn't leave many leftovers behind; of the 29 outtakes compiled on Cabinet's first two discs, only four are originals that didn't feature on the band's first three albums, and three of those (the psych reverie ""Kettle Whistle"", the Stonesy folk ditty ""City"", and Farrell's woefully silly tribute to his cat, ""Maceo"") were already unveiled on Kettle Whistle, makinging an embryonic version of future Strays track ""Suffer Some"" (elements of which would be repurposed into ""No One's Leaving"") the lone revelation. The real lure, then, should be a handsome batch of previously unreleased demos that would form the foundation for 1987's self-titled live-album debut and 1988's breakthrough Nothing's Shocking. However, for all the tales of druggy decadence that surrounded their early years, Jane's showed up in the studio with their shit pretty much together, which means there's little mercurial mystique to be heard in early rips through ""Had a Dad"" and ""Pigs in Zen"". The purpose may be to showcase Jane's in their most primal state; however, unlike most products of the 1980s punk underground, Jane's were never built for lo-fi-- they demanded a wide-screened sound as big as the mountains and oceans Farrell sang about. And hearing Farrell strain his voice on ""Jane Says"", you realize how much of his androgynous charisma owed to the multi-tracked vocal effects favored by producer Dave Jerden. The most notable thing about the demos aren't the performances so much as the recording dates: Even as far back as 1987, Jane's had already mapped out the multi-sectional intricacies of ""Stop!"" and ""Three Days"", three years before they would surface on 1990's Ritual de lo Habitual. The rest of Cabinet's first two discs  is filled out with covers that cheekily acknowledge the band's internal hippie/punk contradictions, particularly on ""Bobhaus"" (Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"" set to Bauhaus' ""Burning From the Inside"") and ""L.A. Medley"", a blitzkrieged blast through the Doors' ""L.A. Woman"", the Germs' ""Lexicon Devil"", and X's ""Nausea"" (though, 18 years after the track first appeared on the ""Classic Girl"" single, its components are still listed in the wrong order). Concert recordings of Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love"" and the Stooges' ""1970"" don't transcend garage-band trashiness; by contrast, Jane's Addiction have never sounded more blissful and beautiful than on their tribute-album transformation of the Grateful Dead's ""Ripple"", which grafts the original's campfire melody onto a rolling jungle-rumble groove and practically invents Animal Collective 10 years early. A showdown between Farrell and Ice-T on Sly Stone's ""Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey"" is more leadfooted, but, in retrospect, it serves a prescient soundtrack to an L.A. whose simmering racial tensions were about to explode into riots. The set's third disc-- a complete concert recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in December 1990-- provides an even more vivid sense of time and place. If the preceding demos and cover versions mostly deconstruct the Jane's myth, this live set reasserts their majesty, with thundering versions of ""Three Days"" and ""Ocean Size"" that evoke that scary/ecstatic feeling of losing your footing in the mosh pit and getting swept up in the tide. The Palladium performance of ""Ain't No Right""-- the one followed by Farrell's rant about Birkenstocks-- is presented in visual form on Cabinet's fourth disc, which charts Jane's evolution through their videos, short films, and concert footage. While Nirvana's Nevermind is often credited with wiping hair-metal off the charts in one fell swoop, Jane's catalogue of videos shows them mobilizing the masses away from 80s Sunset Strip sleaze to the 90s alt-rock uprising. Like so many California rock bands of its time, Jane's Addiction filled their videos with images of the Hollywood Hills, surfing, pool parties,  and (when network censors permitted them) naked chicks. But their aesthetic remove from the L.A. scene is best exemplified by the 1989 hodgepodge short-film Soul Kiss, reproduced here from a VHS copy and comprised of candid shots of Avery discussing his toilet reading while taking a dump; Navarro providing a ""Cribs""-like tour of his squalid apartment (anticipating his future as reality-TV show huckster); and everyone in the band making out with each other. However, Cabinet is lacking one crucial video curio: Gift, Farrell's feature-length, fictionalized account of his heroin-fuelled romance with then-girlfriend Casey Niccoli. History, of course, would show Farrell to be more adept at staging musical festivals than making films; Gift is a mess, its central narrative concerning the Niccoli character's OD routinely upended by tangential Jane's concert footage (including the aforementioned ""Ain't No Right"" clip) and other episodic silliness. But at the time of its 1993 release, Gift was a suitably absurd epitaph to an absurd band whose excesses initially got the better of them. For a box set that indulges die-hard fandom as eagerly as this one, A Cabinet of Curiosities feels a little barren without it. Or maybe they're just saving the reissue for the next reunion tour.","This 4xCD set-- two CDs of demos/rarities, a third of a 1990 live show, and a DVD of video ephemera-- helps celebrate Jane's original-member reunion.

Honey Moon,The Handsome Family,by: Stephen M.

To mark their china anniversary, the couple are foregoing a retrospective of their seven studio albums (although they're certainly due) in favor of a brand-new Family album, fittingly titled Honey Moon. Rather than dwell on country gothic doom and despair, they've recorded all manner of love songs-- odes to sex, devotion, redemption, sacrifice, New Mexico, and more sex-- that are only slightly sunnier than their usual fare. But don't expect corny sentiments even from a song called ""Love Is Like"": Even commemorating two decades together, they indulge the dark edges of these eccentric and personal songs, as if love is all that keeps the abyss at bay. Love is like, Brett sings, ""a black fly buzzing in the sun"" or ""the hole torn right through the roof."" Nevertheless, even at its most ruminative, Honey Moon sounds like a celebratory record, a document of the ups and downs that define any marriage. As if responding to the airports and strip malls of 2006's Last Days of Wonder, these new songs are so full of woodsy imagery that they make Neko Case seem urbane. The only modern edifices here are the pawnshops and neon signs on ""A Thousand Diamond Rings"", and they are transformed into a romantic setting by the ""watermelon light"" of the sun setting over the desert. Nothing stands out as boldly as ""Weightless Again"" on Through the Trees or ""Tesla's Hotel Room"" on Last Days, but the lighter mood suits them sweetly. ""Darling my darling, look at my waving antennae,"" sings Brett on ""Darling, My Darling"". There may be a dick joke hidden in that opening line, but there's more Henry Miller than Franz Kafka as the songs follows the man-as-bug metaphor to its logical conclusion: ""I'll leap on your spine and love you till you gnaw me down to my wings/ I'll give you everything."" That the songs comes across as sweetly romantic and devoted until death-- as opposed to either showy or creepy-- is a testament both to Rennie's skillful threading of words into images and Brett's sensitive translation of words on a page into vocals. In the Handsome Family, Brett and Rennie divide musical duties the way some couples assign household chores. Blessed with a humble, hollowed-out-like-a-tree-trunk baritone, he does most of the singing. An accomplished novelist and poet, she does most of the songwriting. On Honey Moon, Rennie displays a typically observant eye for the small details that become portentous with meaning: A flock of birds beckons thoughts of escape, a sunset changes their world for just a few minutes each day, and a cement mixer inspires existential ponderings. Brett and the extended Family set her deep thoughts to sparse arrangements with subtle animating flourishes like the dreamy 1950s rock piano of ""Linger, Let Me Linger"", Dave Gutierrez's spidery dobro on ""When You Whispered"", or Brett's hoarse whistle on ""The Loneliness of Magnets"". Interestingly for a group most commonly associated with story-based songs, Honey Moon sheds all narrative concerns for more descriptive language. Even ""When You Whispered"", whose title implies a mystery about what exactly was whispered, is less worried over the quiet verbal exchange than the scenery around them: the wind on the bridge, the ripples of water beneath, the frogs on the shore. The album is full of similar tableaux: These songs are dioramas depicting the New Mexico wilderness as a reverberation of the couple's desires.","Latest from these indie vets isn't country gothic doom but rather love songs-- odes to sex, devotion, redemption, sacrifice, and more sex.

The Black Dirt Sessions,Jack Rose,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a381b1335d7bf169874a/1:1/w_160/f174f823.jpg,2009-04-27 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12901-the-black-dirt-sessions/,Three Lobed,"The field of solo folk guitar players has always been heavily populated, almost by definition, with eccentric characters and iconoclasts. Yet even among this crowd, guitarist Jack Rose stands out as a musician with some particularly unusual habits. Whether as a solo performer, in his former group Pelt, or with his numerous other collaborators, Rose resolutely keeps his own counsel, as his music progresses from dilated abstract drones to the most devoutly traditional folk-blues exercises. Unlike most artists, however, Rose does not necessarily use his records as a means to introduce listeners to his newest material, but rather as a sort of milepost to indicate where his latest paths have lead him. As a result of this quirky recording philosophy, Rose has shown a tendency to return time and again to reinterpret the same material, whether it be his own compositions or such vintage staples as Blind Willie Johnson's ""Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)"". Perhaps Rose attempts these revisions through a sense of perfectionism, but more often than not his investigations seem to simply derive from restless curiosity, as though his own songs were puzzles to be solved or knots he can't quite fully untie. True to form, then, that in addition to a couple of new songs, Rose's latest album The Black Dirt Sessions contains several tracks that have appeared in other versions on previous records. The most notable of these is the epic ""Cross the North Fork"", a piece that Rose has recorded in three earlier variations. (Or maybe even more, since the Pelt track ""Up the North Fork"" from their 2003 release Pearls From the River seems to be at least a half-sibling.) And though this repetition might make one wish that Rose was more willing to branch out as a composer, his boundless expressive abilities help keep these pieces fresh and full of discovery. On Rose's 2004 album Raag Manifestos, ""Crossing the Great Waters"" appeared as an energetic raga, and by 2005's Kensington Blues, it had morphed into the dense and exquisite ""Cross the North Fork"". Here the piece has become ever more drawn out and contemplative, like taking a leisurely stroll through an old, familiar neighborhood, with Rose taking care to savor every small detail. All of Rose's established influences are still in evidence-- stray elements of raga, ragtime, and the heavy echoes of the Takoma catalog-- but by this point they have been fully internalized, and Rose fills his playing with an easy, graceful authority. At various points in his career, Rose's fondness for traditional forms has raised the temptation to dismiss him as a mere revivalist, and this was never more true than on last year's Dr. Ragtime and His Pals, a collection of roots-based material that may sound too conservative for fans of his more experimental work. Typically enough this criticism seems to have not concerned Rose in the slightest, and The Black Dirt Sessions includes three newly-altered versions of songs from Dr. Ragtime, and each seems a subtle improvement. On ""Fishtown Flower"" Rose goes for the full cowboy-saloon effect as he is joined by Hans Chew's jaunty ragtime piano, and on ""Song for the Owl"" he again displays his vibrant slide-playing skills. One constant with Rose is that his albums have always been impeccably well-produced, and The Black Dirt Sessions is no exception. Recorded at Jason Meagher's Black Dirt Studio in Westtown, NY, the album ably captures every burr and spark from Rose's guitar and reliably rewards extended headphone play. Masterful though these performances are, however, with Rose one can never assume that these are intended to be definitive recordings, or whether he might not someday want to take yet another crack at these songs.","True to form for him, the latest from solo folk guitar player Jack Rose is a mix of new and reworked material.

Moderat,Moderat,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d2ea9e61561daa4d7d/1:1/w_160/7bd3bab4.jpg,2009-04-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12959-moderat/,Bpitch Control,"Before Modeselektor toured with Radiohead on the heels of their Happy Birthday! and Apparat found acclaim for his stargazing electro dream-pop, there existed an early incarnation of Moderat. Back in 2002, Modeselektor's Sebastian Szary and Gernot Bronsert linked up with Sascha Ring (Apparat) to lay down a collaborative full-length and, gently put, it didn't work out. The trio found the recording process so personally damaging they named the resulting material (which, tellingly, became an EP) Auf Kosten der Gesundheit (""At the Cost of Health""). Naturally it didn't seem like they'd be getting back together anytime soon. For whatever reason, the guys decided to give it another shot (apparently a chance encounter at the Berlin-Mitte City Pool sparked the reunion). Still, on paper the collaboration doesn't seem like a cakewalk, mainly because the two acts don't share much stylistic common ground. Modeselektor's music is built on a combination of glitch, electro, and hip-hop thump and it's all about thrust and action-- the art of dropping heavy bass and making people go apeshit in a club. Apparat, meanwhile, tends to look inward. He utilizes more conventional pop structures that are wrapped in shoegaze synths and layers of atmosphere for something closer akin to what M83 is doing these days. Of course, it's this aesthetic dissimilarity that makes the record an exciting prospect. And the good news is that (for the most part) they pulled it off. Long stretches of Moderat find the three producers locked into a healthy creative symbiosis that accentuates the best parts of their individual styles. The record's best tracks, like first single ""A New Error"", illustrate the balance. It bounces along with the muscular energy we expect out of Modeselektor without ignoring the warm astral qualities of an Apparat song. Others, such as standout ""Seamonkey"", pull off the same feat with even more complexity. The song opens with a minute-plus of nasty, walloping bass and just when you start to wonder if that's all there is, it unfurls into something much more intricate. Moderat is generous with moments like this-- tracks gather steam and reveal fresh layers as they move forward-- and they're what make the record a captivating listen. This is especially true of its more robust pieces. What opens as a minimal synth sequence on ""Les Grandes Marches"" becomes a vigorous beat assault by song's end. ""Nr. 22""-- arguably the record's finest cut and the best take on your standard build-and-release techno I've heard in awhile-- starts out all silent and whispery before a setting loose a hyperactive-synth and staccato-drum pattern sure to strip paint off the walls of clubs from Berlin to Brooklyn. Such club-ready moments split time with a variety of other styles ranging from gentle atmospheric numbers to grime-inflected pop tracks. Most of them are winners. Ring takes up vocal duties on ""Rusty Nails"" and ""Out of Sight"", a pair that most closely resembles his breakout work with 2007's Walls. The difference here is that the shoegaze/dream-pop structures that dominated that album are swapped out for stabs at dubstep. This might have came across as disingenuous trend-jacking on lesser material, but Moderat's savvy enough to incorporate the form in such a way that adds their own spin to it. (Even if, yeah, the beats do owe a lot to Burial.) The stretch between ""Slow Match"" and ""Sick with It""-- where Modeselektor try their hand at a few dancehall cuts-- is the only shaky portion of the album and could have easily been left on the cutting-room floor. And that's the other thing: the record is too long. (Sandwiched between the reggae numbers are the mostly ""meh"" ""3 Minutes of"" and ""Nasty Silence"".) For one reason or another, Modeselektor seem unwilling to trim the fat (read any review of Happy Birthday! and the central criticism is always length) and here again, are a handful of just-okay songs that probably should have been lopped off. Cut some of them and you've got a great record instead of just a darn good one.","Seven years on from a rough collaboration, Modeselektor and Apparat give it another go, aiming to combine their very individual styles into something striking.

Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian,Prefuse 73,by: Jess Harvell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d59d034d5c69bf2f01/1:1/w_160/cb8e4013.jpg,2009-04-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12961-everything-she-touched-turned-ampexian/,Warp,"Guillermo Scott Herren has become a model of 21st-century post-techno productivity, if not necessarily consistency. Qualitatively, that is; there are certainly audible links between and within each of Herren's not-quite-disparate endeavors. Despite being most identified with genres known for their rhythmic punch (hip-hop) and textural layering (glitch electronica), the Prefuse 73 discography is united by Herren's skill with melody, the warm glue binding his often ultra-fractured rhythm and noise together. It's the comforting low-end hum of fusion-era organs, or the bright synth line guiding listeners through his gloriously disorienting vocal and percussion edits. And no Prefuse album has ever felt so thoroughly edited than the new Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian. An hour-ish mosaic of rhythmic snippets and melodic scribbles, most averaging a minute or less, Ampexian is in the tradition of the single-artist album as delirious self-constructed DJ set, many tracks combined into one flowing composition to discourage shuffle function tomfoolery. Even Prefuse's 2001 debut, the indelible Vocal Studies and Uprock Narratives, featured more sketches than songs, but Ampexian is built from stacked fragments of boom-bap and digital ambiance that would bounce right past your half-conscious ear when removed from their context, rather than two-minute interludes slid between traditional three- or four-minute grooves. So, sure, you could sieve the nerve-jangling music-box miniature ""No Lights Still Rock"" for some personal playlist, but it's designed (presumably) to follow ""Simple Loop Choir"", an ultra-chill moment in love. Does this tapestry aesthetic pay off? Yes and no. ""No Lights Still Rock"", annoying in that overly antic way common to several generations of Warp Records artists, is a bomb dropped to disrupt the listener's reverie, but it comes off as an irritating intrusion rather than a mood-altering segue. That's obviously a problem when the goal is end-to-end enjoyment, with your fingers a comfortable distance from the skip button. Unless you're making outright background music-- and Ampexian is too restless for that designation-- lack of flow is a cardinal sin when constructing an album that asks to be played first minute to last, especially in an era of endless easy distractions. And perhaps non-fans used to mixing and matching MP3s will suffer Herren's occasional sequencing missteps for the moments when that aforementioned melodic instinct makes him shoot for swoon-worthiness over laptop shock-and-awe. It's hard to imagine any Prefuse project fully abandoning agitation, the thrill of Herren's digital slicing and dicing. But the highlights of Ampexian suggest that if he did want to use the moniker for easier listening, the results would genuinely beguile, rather than demand your full attention and hope for the best.","A mosaic of rhythmic snippets and melodic scribbles, most averaging a minute or less, this LP is in the tradition of the single-artist album as DJ set.

Post-Nothing,Japandroids,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d95e6ef95969320726/1:1/w_160/5d1204ea.jpg,2009-04-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12965-post-nothing/,Unfamiliar,"Disliking teen-pop gets you cast as some sort of rockist Luddite these days, but beyond the fact that most of it doesn't sound like stuff I'd have wanted to hear as a high schooler, it doesn't feel like music for teens either. (Hell, it's more tween-pop than teen-pop anyway.) But what about the kind of stuff that, say, the ""1979"" video lionized-- breaking into your folks' liquor cabinet, obliterating the speed limit despite just getting your learner's permit, leaving your hometown for the first time and discovering how small it feels. What about jamming out with your best bud and deciding to call it a band? These are the kind of gut-level concerns Post-Nothing trades in, and I know, on paper it describes an itch that a late-1990s Vagrant record could scratch. And combined with the fact that the band is called freakin' Japandroids, it's easy to not take it seriously. Which is fine, since Japandroids do not make particularly complex music: Brian King plays broad chords stewed in mid-90s fuzz (think Superchunk) while David Prowse splays spastic but never showy drum fills that beg to be pounded out on your steering wheel. There's maybe one overdub on the whole thing and occasionally, both of them yell at the same time. Several songs have less than five lines. And while they've been known to cover Mclusky's ""To Hell With Good Intentions"" live, what makes Post-Nothing such a blast is how Japandroids tend to embody the opposite sentiment of that song title. This is terminally catchy music played with punk's enthusiasm and velocity, and maybe it's the fact that there's only two dudes in this band that makes you feel like joining in to bash along. It's as fun as an ill-gotten sixpack and there really aren't too many bands doing stuff like this well anymore. Recent trends, however, might make you think otherwise: Due to their two-man setup and no-frills recording, Japandroids risk being lumped into the increasingly tiresome no-fi/noise-pop scene that finds bands using distortion to tear through the fabric of the medium and, in some cases, drown out weak songs. Either way, there's some form of obfuscation, but what makes Post-Nothing such a thrill is the manner in which Japandroids hold absolutely nothing back. As contagious as any of the lyrics, melodies, riffs, or drum fills are, their energy and lack of self-consciousness is every bit as equally lovable. Opening mission statement ""The Boys Are Leaving Town"" could be seen as a goof on Thin Lizzy, but the response, ""Will we find our way back home?"", is delivered with such conviction that between those two lines, ""Boys"" displays a palpable desperation. Six tracks later, the question is still unresolved-- amidst the cyclical thrum of ""Sovereignty"", they observe: ""It's raining, OH-OH! in Vancouver/ But I don't give a fuck/ 'Cause I'm far from home tonight."" So yeah, it's a record about distance. For the most part it's a record about the distance between themselves and girls. Too often, similar records find themselves lapsing into easy misogyny, and while ""Heart Sweats"" skirts the issue, the in-jokes are kinda duds. Nonetheless, its thick riff is a good introduction to the less excitable but still very exciting side B. ""Crazy/Forever"" is heaving stoner rock (think Black Mountain with hooks), and closer ""I Quit Girls"" is about as close to a power ballad as Japandroids will allow themselves. It's full of musical drama-- King reaches for falsetto amidst almost-synthetic guitar EQ'ing and it's the longest stretch of time with no drumming, but the whole thing is leavened by a tongue-in-cheek pledge of devotion from Rowse: ""After her, I quit girls."" The distance is emotional as well as physical on ""Wet Hair"", and I'll be surprised if I play another song in 2009 as much as this one. Its structure is almost comically linear-- there's three lines in the whole thing, and the most ridiculous one gets repeated for nearly half of its three minutes, something about going to France to French kiss some French girls. There's hardly even a verse-chorus structure, just a single melody that repeats itself faster after the drums drop out. But it's one hell of a melody, and it's lyric, like much of Post-Nothing, doesn't need to be analyzed or even understood to be felt. Where it all comes together best is ""Young Hearts Spark Fire"". Almost a flipside to LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"", it's thematically similar, trading wistful reminiscence for drunken defiance and pulsing electro for chaotic garage rock. The five minutes go by in a blur, and amidst the guitar heroics and cymbal-bashing, King lets his guard down on Post-Nothing's key line-- ""We used to dream/ Now we worry about dying/ I don't want to worry about dying."" It would be so easy to view this sort of musical and lyrical directness with suspicion, but ""Young Hearts"" is life-affirming stuff-- if only it affirms that, even in these times, life doesn't need to be as complicated as we tend to make it.","Guitar/drums band from Vancouver makes terminally catchy music played with punk's enthusiasm and velocity that makes you feel like joining in to bash along.

High on Jackson Hill,Immaculate Machine,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c2b1335d7bf16987d0/1:1/w_160/1c255efd.jpg,2009-04-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12948-high-on-jackson-hill/,Mint,"High on Jackson Hill comes a bit less than two years after Immaculate Machine's Fables, whose minor charms came from the way it filtered gentle advice through cute cautionary tales (and, let's not forget, the positively charming Kathryn Calder, a touring member of the New Pornographers). Hill opens with ""Don't Build the Bridge"", which links the two records nicely. Brooke Gallupe admonishes someone he deems is making a possibly risky social move: ""Don't build the bridge, if you don't want to let the riff raff over."" It's a sincere enough sentiment, but it also sets an precedent for the rest of the album. Gallupe has mostly taken over the reins of the band-- Calder provides background vocals and gets the spotlight on one song, ""You Destroyer""-- and the fruits of his solo stewardship, as represented on ""Bridge"", can leave a bit of a bitter taste, when they leave a taste at all. If Fables was an angel on your shoulder whispering advice, about a third of Jackson Hill sits between the poles of doomsday forecasts and caustic reprimands. ""Sound the Alarms"" is an acoustic march led by Gallupe to warn anyone within earshot that ""we're at the dead end of everything,"" because his generation has lost all of its good ideas. Gallupe tells us on ""He's a Biter"" exactly where those ideas have gone: they're dead, having been ""bitten"" by ""downtown loft vampires."" ""Biter"", unsurprisingly, doubles as Gallupe's attempt to draw lines around appropriate aesthetic behavior. ""There are some who lead and some who make it look as though they've led,"" he teaches us, before striking out at those who ""Photoshop themselves into the credits when they can."" Perhaps a bit ironically, ""Biter"" is Hill's most reverent bit of pastiche, a direct line to Marc Bolan's groovy Slider-period electric doo-wop. ""You Got Us Into This Mess"" could gloss on another album as a broad political statement, but here, a line like ""It could have gone my way on any other day"" is most likely very personal. And kind of selfish, too,  but not as much as ""Thank Me Later"", which broadcasts Gallupe's healthy egotism in its title alone. Perhaps pungency is Gallupe's preferred register, because the rest of Hill isn't nearly as memorable. The rocker ""Neighbours Don't Mind"" and the nostalgic ""And It Was"" may be on opposite ends of the tempo spectrum, but they're united under a conservative register: partying in a bachelor apartment and dancing in a ""little old pub"" are exactly the things that Gallupe wants to save from scenester gentrification. But advocacy works worst when it passes by unnoticed, and none of the album's sentiment or craft sticks when it's not severe; Hill's vinegar is, unfortunately, much stickier than its honey. Irony, or at least that's what I hope ""Only Love You For Your Car"" is, doesn't work well either: What Gallupe tries to pass as playful sarcasm is more a rhyme scheme cop-out: ""I only love you for your car/ It's a shame the way things are"". That bit does signal the biggest problem of Jackson Hill, a letdown after Fables; whether haughty, homesick, or ha-ha, on the way toward frankness, the album gets bogged down in simplicity.","Led by Brooke Gallupe and New Pornos touring member Kathryn Calder, this indie band explores doomsday forecasts and caustic reprimands on its latest album.

Wyllt,Black Math Horseman,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d113d1975652138b90/1:1/w_160/90a3f5ff.jpg,2009-04-24 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12958-wyllt/,Tee Pee,"Wyllt, Black Math Horseman's debut, is a fascinating compendium of the last 30 years of rock. Many bands are retro-aware-- see Bigelf, as well as most of Black Math Horseman's labelmates on Tee Pee-- but few embody the past yet avoid merely wearing its clothes. Retro awareness usually involves blinders to the present, which Black Math Horseman do not wear. One school of thought says that everything that can be done has been done. If so, Black Math Horseman have sharp filters. They've funneled the best parts of rock's giants into a richly idiosyncratic entity. Black Math Horseman = Led Zeppelin's bombast + Black Sabbath's rhythm section + 1970s psych rock dilation + Isis' minimal-maximal dynamics. This is a horrible description, I know. But when listening to Wyllt, it's impossible not to hear decades of record collecting riffling by. Parts of ""Deerslayer"", for example, could have been on Badmotorfinger (Soundgarden chaneling Sabbath), Ritual de lo Habitual (Jane's Addiction channeling Zeppelin), and, of all things, She Hangs Brightly. Sera Timms' mostly cool-tempered voice suggests Nico on 4AD, complete with ghostly reverb. The gauzy ""Torment of the Metals"" recasts the Doors' ""The End"" as Krautrock. But though this record was raised on radio, no cuts are obvious singles, especially with Timms haunting the back of the mix. A college party soundtrack this is not. For all the references this record evokes, it feels elusive. The band seems like it's working from deep within its influences. Songs are layered yet minimal. No jam sections here-- every note is in its place. The result is a studied diligence that's appealingly austere, yet frustratingly restrained. Black Math Horseman have potent ingredients, but they cook them at a simmer. That makes Wyllt a smooth listen, but it rarely boils over. Most attempts to do so merely raise bubbles. The one exception is ""Bird of All Faiths and None/Bell from Madrone"". This 11-minute behemoth closes the record with a vocal performance on par with early PJ Harvey. Timms cuts through her reverb, sonorously elongating syllables, bending blue notes to the hilt, and howling with feral abandon. Janis Joplin would approve. Here, Black Math Horseman access the dark mojo of Black Sabbath; Timms accesses pure animality. More like this, please. Classic rock was scary once; Black Math Horseman could make it scary again.","The debut LP from this Tee Pee band is a fascinating compendium of the last 30 years of rock, from Zep and Sabbath through to Soundgarden and Isis.

Constant Hitmaker / God Is Saying This to You,Kurt Vile,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3cbc0084474cd0c0344/1:1/w_160/1048f2b6.jpg,2009-04-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12953-constant-hitmaker-god-is-saying-this-to-you/,Woodsist,"Sometimes an artist pens a song title that more perfectly captures his aesthetic in words than any review could. Thoughtfully, the War on Drugs' Kurt Vile has done this with his solo work via Constant Hitmaker's ""Classic Rock in Spring/Freeway in Mind"". See? Done. You know exactly how that should sound-- as nostalgic, wistful, and sunlit as the title suggests, with Vile crooning softly into a Jim James-sized cavern of reverb over some finger-picked chords about ""riding on your Yellow Schwinn and blasting classic rock in spring."" Those are some mighty big signifiers for a twentysomething kid to be throwing around, but Vile knows his way around them like they were living-room furniture. Kurt Vile (real name, no gimmicks) has seemingly absorbed a lifetime's worth of FM rock, and the ghosts of Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and others glimmer under the surface of his woozy, homemade bedroom pop. Vile recorded the majority of these songs on his own, and the sputter of the cheap drum software and the murmuring vocals testify to the kind of guy who doesn't want to wake up his parents upstairs. Nonetheless, even in this sleepy, abstracted form, there is no mistaking the widescreen Tom Pettyisms of ""Freeway"", from the wry hiccup of the vocal to the sunshower of jangling guitars that accompanies the track. Constant Hitmaker, his 2008 debut on Gulcher, snagged the ear of an attentive few, and now it is being reissued along with God Is Saying This To You, a limited edition LP, on vinyl. The sound of God Is Saying This To You is slightly cleaner and clearer than the bleary, sound effects-addled Constant Hitmaker, but that only means Vile sounds like he's singing from the bottom of a mineshaft this time instead of from the ocean floor. And it still feels like you're eavesdropping: Vile delivers every line in an amiable mumble, the sort of voice you use when you're humming something to yourself and only know every other word: ""Hey girl, come on over, that'll be just fine. Two packs of red apples for the ride home,"" he murmurs over and over again on ""Red Apples"", and it sounds like the half-remembered chorus of some John Mellencamp song. Vile has talked in interviews about his various odd jobs (he sings about operating a forklift on Constant Hitmaker) and his single, unfruitful semester in community college, and it rounds out the portrait suggested by his music: that of the talented but aimless kid in high school, the one who smoked pot every day but read philosophy textbooks in his free time, the sort of guy who identified viscerally with the borrowed blue-collar sentiments of classic rock radio. Kurt Vile channels this hangdog charm effortlessly, scrawling wayward little vocal melodies like the one on ""Breathin Out"" with the ease of a hesher Bob Pollard. Sections of Constant Hitmaker are bogged down with a few too many pedals-and-loops sound collages, but for most of the ride, Constant Hitmaker/God Is Saying This To You ambles dreamily along a perfect midway point between the disorientingly weird and the comfortingly familiar.","Kurt Vile has absorbed a lifetime's worth of 70s FM rock, and the ghosts of Springsteen and others glimmer under the surface of his woozy bedroom pop.

I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got [Limited Edition],Sinéad O'Connor,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3cdb1335d7bf16987e5/1:1/w_160/5e6e63b2.jpg,2009-04-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12954-i-do-not-want-what-i-havent-got-limted-edition/,EMIChrysalis,"On the bonus disc of this deluxe 2xCD reissue of Sinéad O'Connor's 1990 sophomore album, there's a live version of ""Troy"", the epic and visceral psychodrama from her debut three years earlier. Where the version of ""Troy"" on The Lion and the Cobra is lushly orchestrated, painting the story of desire and betrayal on a wall-sized canvas, O'Connor performed the song in concert alone on acoustic guitar. Despite the spare setting, every twist and turn the song takes is rendered even more dynamically on the strength of her singing, which gradually modulates from a soft whisper recalling better times to a hair-raising accusatory howl. At the song's climax, she screams into the microphone, her voice breaking into a million pieces: ""You're still a fucking liar!"". ""Harrowing"" is the only word that comes close to describing it. Was it just theater? It's possible. Sure doesn't sound like it, though. The way O'Connor was singing ""Troy"" as the 1980s ended, you get the feeling that something had to change, and soon. Exposing yourself to people like that repeatedly, especially for someone carrying around cartloads of emotional baggage, someone with questionable judgment and a knack for doing ill-advised things in public, is a good way to end up deep trouble. Which she did. She had some tough years in the 90s, getting in hot water for refusing to allow the ""Star Spangled Banner"" to be played prior to a show in New Jersey, tearing up the Pope's picture on ""Saturday Night Live"", and having an onstage meltdown after being booed at a Bob Dylan tribute. Early O'Connor can now seem a model for a certain kind of feminine intensity in rock music, one that moves effortlessly between ethereality and fire-spitting. But for a while, all you wondered about was what controversy was going to dog her next. Ironically, the album that thrust her into the spotlight, that place where all mistakes are amplified, hinted that she was destined for something else. There's just as much pain on display on I Do Not Want as there was on her debut, but O'Connor was growing up fast. She was starting to understand the concept of artistic distance, ways to transform the hurt into something more people could grasp. She was still writing from the gut, casting aside lyrical devices to say what's on her mind even if it didn't fit the meter of the song. But she started singing with restraint and nuance, allowing for an easier way in. So ""It seems like years since you held the baby/ While I wrecked the bedroom,"" from ""Emperor's New Clothes"", is delivered with a muted lilt, O'Connor's voice bright and possibly a little hopeful, confident in her strength despite the weight of the past. While ""Black Boys on Mopeds"", an anti-Thatcher (and anti-England) song, is ghostly and downcast, the voice and guitar expressing a sort of nurturing sadness instead of just rage. For many, of course, the album will always be about ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", a cover of a song Prince had written years before for the Time offshoot the Family. Both the song and the simple and heartbreaking video are what O'Connor will always be remembered for, and with good reason: you have to look pretty hard to find a better expression in pop music of the void that exists when a relationship ends. And if nothing else on I Do Not Want rises to that level, almost nothing else on any other albums does either. Instead, the record is mostly quiet and folky, the voice-and-guitar ballads alternating with tracks like ""I'm Stretched on Your Grave"", which combines a traditional melody with the then-ubiquitous ""funky drummer"" beat, and ""Jump in the River"", which shows that O'Connor wasn't necessarily suited for writing upbeat songs you might hear on the radio. And soon, she'd stop trying. The so-so bonus disc is fleshed out with songs that hint at where she'd go next. She'd try standards (Cole Porter's ""You Do Something to Me"", from the 1990 Red Hot & Blue comp), imaginative covers of kindred spirits (here it's a decent take on John Lennon's ""Mind Games"", later it would be Nirvana's ""All Apologies""), and genre experiments (Gregory Isaacs' ""Night Nurse"" hinted at her reggae obsession). She became more of a quirky cult artist still capable of a brilliant song from time to time, which seemed to suit her much better. She also stopped performing ""Troy"" for almost 20 years, finally dusting it off in 2008 for a festival in Antwerp. There's a good YouTube out there. This time she was fronting a full orchestra, a middle-aged woman in bare feet and graying hair whose voice still had power. Last year's ""Troy"" is not nearly as raw as what was she was doing in her 20s, but it's reassuring, somehow, as it makes you glad for longevity. It seems like she's finally in control, having figured out how to perform the song instead of just channeling it.","Sinead O'Connor's breakthrough is the latest record to receive the deluxe treatment, adding a bonus disc that pointed to her future detours and quirks.

Songs of Shame,Woods,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32fb1335d7bf1698683/1:1/w_160/74e65414.jpg,2009-04-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12837-songs-of-shame/,ShrimperWoodsist,"Like many Woodsist Records alums-- the NYC-based label has also recently issued records by Vivian Girls, Wavves, Crystal Stilts, and Sic Alps-- Woods have spent much of their time together quickly earning respect and fans in underground rock circles. Unlike those previously mentioned groups, however, they've done it by exploring a more pastoral and rustic vein of songcraft rather than loft-ready noise. On their three previous albums-- released in limited editions on a variety of formats across a choice selection of micro-labels-- Woods created a distinctive blend of spooky campfire folk, lo-fi rock, homemade tape collages, and other noisy interludes, all anchored by deceptively sturdy melodies. Woods' latest album, Songs of Shame, is their most cohesive collection, and it's not only quickly lifted them to front of the Woodsist crew but positioned them to be the group that appeals to those who've previously been uninterested in the 2008-09 crop of lo-fi. As with the best lo-fi albums, Songs of Shame performs some sleight-of-hand by sounding private and homespun yet also not just accessible but immediately lovable. Along the way, Woods can evoke any number of their lo-fi ancestors, from early Guided by Voices to the murkier depths of the Siltbreeze or Flying Nun back catalogs, but they're still able to retain their own immediately recognizable off-kilter character. The group is centered primarily on the duo of Jeremy Earl (proprietor of Fuck It Tapes) and Jarvis Taveniere (Meneguar, Wooden Wand) and they've designed this record through an affinity for home recording and its attendant cassette culture. As befits an act with a somewhat befuddling discography, many of the recordings on Songs of Shame first appeared last fall on the tour cassette Some Shame. But even for the select few who've heard that release, these tracks have lost none of their charm. On the melodic ""Down This Road"" or ""Born to Lose"", Earl's vocals have a strange, slightly unhinged pitch, sounding something like a muffled Neil Young. Drums clatter in the distance as though buried behind drywall, and G. Lucas Crane occasionally adds discreet tape effects to the din. Meanwhile, forceful guitar solos zoom unpredictably in and out of the frame, hazily recalling a time when it seemed every band boasted at least one avid J Mascis aficionado. Of course, it wouldn't be a Woods album without a few surprises. The most glaring example is the nine-minute guitar jam ""September With Pete"", which features a cameo from Magik Markers' Pete Nolan. Although the piece is solid and less jarring than some of Woods' past noise experiments, its position early on the LP somewhat dulls the album's momentum. Equally unexpected is another Some Shame holdover, a faithful cover of Graham Nash's ""Military Madness"", an earnest anti-war ditty that in Woods' hands sounds like Nash and Young strumming away in the treehouse while Crosby and Stills are forced to wait out in the car. Mirroring the wistful tone of ""Military Madness"", the album closes with an especially potent trio of songs: ""Rain On"", ""Gypsy Hand"", and ""Where and What Are You?"". The melancholic ""Rain On"" in particular is a near-perfect dusky gem, underlining the album's subtle themes of loss and disaffection. Despite Woods' humble production values and their fondness for living room ambiance, Songs of Shame has that almost subliminal ability to make one want to move in to listen more closely. And once you've been drawn in for a good listen, it becomes difficult not to want to come back for many more.","They share a label and lo-fi bent with groups like Vivian Girls, but Woods focus on a more pastoral and rustic vein of songcraft to beautiful effect.

Are Men,The Weight,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32413d1975652138a0f/1:1/w_160/61fce474.jpg,2009-04-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12828-are-men/,Tee PeeColonel,"As an inveterate lover of boozy, rowdy, loud country-rock, the Weight's Are Men should be precisely my brand of critical catnip. The New York-by-way-of-Georgia act evokes both Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle in the half-twangy, half-grizzled voice of its lead singer, Joseph Plunket, and proffers sloppy southern-friend grooves to match. Of course, even a style as seemingly unschooled and off-the-cuff as the Weight's is still a style, and the band's shambling insouciance paradoxically can feel just as contrived as any more obviously fussed-over assembly-line C&W. Are Men shambles out of the gate with the drunk shuffle of ""Like Me Better"", and right away it's easy to get sucked in by the band's compelling aesthetic charms. Plunket has the kind of perfect country voice that's suffused with knowing heartache yet somehow still sounds effortlessly seductive, and the band behind him comfortably digs into a variety of tempos and styles. ""Had It Made"" coolly deploys a Chuck Berry waddle while the harmonica-driven ""A Day in the Sun"" explicitly mines the Stonesy blues-rock that's always lurking within this kind of music. ""Johnny's Song"" and ""Hillbilly Highway"" hold tantalizing teases of pedal steel and fiddle, respectively, and ""Closer Than a Friend"" tosses out a few ""ooh la la la""s straight from Rubber Soul for good measure. You'll notice a few very familiar names in the preceding paragraph, and that's part of the problem. These are exhaustively charted waters the band is navigating, and the sheer predictability of these moves can be numbing no matter how smoothly they're handled. A spark of wit or insight or even honest self-examination from Plunket's pen would have been greatly appreciated as well, but unfortunately he's mostly content to play the role of unflappably cool yet unspeakably damaged heartbreaker here, feigning hurt for anonymously hopeless girls with a depressing lack of real empathy. ""Hillbilly Highway"" and ""Evergreen"" boast their share of bucolic charms, and ""Had It Made"" offers a crowd-pleasing litany of Southern city names that brings to mind Wilco's ""Monday"", but those efforts are undercut by the churlish likes of ""Sunday Driver"" and ""Closer Than a Friend"", groupie-weary songs that remind you what a marvel Okkervil River's ""On Tour With Zykos"" really was. To be a real rebel or outlaw and not just an immaculately disheveled pretender, you've got to be willing to risk looking like an ass, to risk saying something embarrassing or unpleasant, to deliberately put yourself outside your own comfort zone. Steve ""Let's Empathize with an American Terrorist"" Earle and Dwight ""Sure, I'll Cover Queen in a Gap Commercial"" Yoakam have utilized these principles in fashioning iconic careers. For the sake of comparison, hold The Weight's achievements up against those of another former Athens denizen, Jason Isbell. The latter clearly follows his own stubborn muse no matter what uncool roads or emotionally unflattering avenues it makes him follow. It's an example the Weight's wasted miles of style would be wise to emulate.","This New York-by-way-of-Georgia act creates boozy, rowdy, loud country-rock.

Mythomania,Cryptacize,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b6b1335d7bf16987b3/1:1/w_160/24ced1a1.jpg,2009-04-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12939-mythomania/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Here's the paradox of Chris Cohen's post-Deerhoof canon: We love its infantile, gee-golly-mister tone, yet his better work is usually celebrated as sounding ""grown up"" or ""mature,"" literally and/or figuratively. On the last album from the Curtains, another of his former bands, Cohen finally wrangled his Pandora's box of ideas into structured songs, and the group's growth smacked of something like developmental biology. Founded with singer Nedelle Torrisi, Cryptacize prods Cohen into more ""adult"" territory, though the group's debut still evinced cringe-worthy cuteness in songs like ""Cosmic Sing-a-long"", which contained the mantra ""Every note is an unfinished song."" Considering Cohen's penchant for penning so much loose, unfinished-sounding material, that's a tough ethos to get behind. Fortunately, Mythomania resurrects the gravitas Cohen contributed to The Runners Four while also retaining a childlike sense of wonder. Conjuring the sounds of the 1960s and 70s has always been Cohen's bread and butter, but on Mythomania the interpretation carries more weight. While Curtains and Crypticize's debut Dig That Treasure mostly espoused an eerily upbeat, almost cult-like take on psych rock, shit feels realer here. Mythomania isn't holding hands and drinking Kool-Aid, it's tripping on acid and pondering the great questions of the cosmos. Listening to ""Galvanize""'s chilly space operatics or the moody windmill guitar strumming on ""The Loving Sun"" recalls the moments on Cohen-era Deerhoof albums where the band's classic rock side gushed out, revealing a subconscious desire to make another Led Zep II. Not to be outshined, Torrisi logs a commendable effort in her expanded vocal role. The slithering melodies on ""Tail & Mane"" and ""Blue Tears"" capture The Zombies and Love at their most infectious, though not without throwing the listener a fair share of necromantic curveballs. Even the title track's saccharine verse is salvaged by a killer refrain, a twee-like acuteness that the band's previous material lacked. The normally phlegmatic Cohen offers moments of poignancy, too, most notably on the pretty phenomenological crisis ballad ""What You Can't See Is"". (Its opening line ""Part of me/ You're only seeing part of me"" is the album's tenderest moment.) Finding unique ways to handle empty space and unorthodox arrangements has always been Cohen's greatest strength, and here that skill helps to mottle his most straightforward material to date. Mythomania isn't without its dry patches, but the orchestration never resorts to the same trick twice, but rather props up the album's more mediocre pop tunes. That's a far cry from the wonky sound collages that plagued early Curtains albums, and an indication that the group, with its members seemingly crawling into new shells every few months, has finally found a habitat to do some of that artistic maturing we're always not-so-secretly hoping for.","Former Deerhoof guy Chris Cohen releases the latest from his new, Sufjan Stevens-approved project.

Mean Everything to Nothing,Manchester Orchestra,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3be9d034d5c69bf2ed2/1:1/w_160/4cdcab16.jpg,2009-04-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12944-mean-everything-to-nothing/,Favorite GentlemenCanvasback,"One of the tactics that we develop as teenagers is the ability, triggered by wanting to grow up and get out way too fast, to render somewhat ordinary feelings in overwrought terms. Andy Hull, the barely-able-to-legally drink driving force behind Manchester Orchestra, is one such kid. He formed the band in the Atlanta suburbs in his junior year of high school, and the resultant album titles signal his desire to transcend his youth with verbiage: There's the purposefully paradoxical, mildly shocking, and certainly cheesy I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child, or the 2005 EP You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, But Brilliance Needs a Good Editor (apparently, album titles are excluded from said editing). Mean Everything to Nothing, the title of the band's latest and best-yet effort, tamps down the dramatics in favor of a pithy phrase drawn from the Young Existentialist's Handbook. The emotions on Everything still run incredibly high, but the music has gotten much buffer, due no doubt to the band's relentless touring schedule over the past few years. The shift also owes something to the able hand of producer Joe Chiccarelli, who made the Shins sound arena-sized on Wincing the Night Away and manned the wayward ship of My Morning Jacket's Evil Urges, which for all of its ill-considered moves, still at least sounded great. In one interview last year, Hull called Everything ""Pinkerton on steroids,"" and while the latter is certainly true, opening track ""The Only One"" makes Manchester Orchestra sound a lot more like ""Kings of Leon's younger brothers.""  Like the Followill clan, Southern signifiers are packed tight amidst beefy riffs, with Hull's plaint that ""I'm the only son of a pastor I know who does the things I do"" substituting youthful angst for the brazen groupie-fucking of the Kings, themselves sons of a preacher man. ""The Only One"" opens a solidly rocking first half of Everything, on which the band builds a blazing bulwark of stadium-sized redneck-dread. On ""Shake It Out"", Hull's lyrics-- voiced in a half-shouted/half-sung timbre that should sound exceedingly familiar by now-- ride a dual-exhaust punk riff to a chorus that just barely stops itself from diving headfirst into hillbilly territory. The title ""I've Got Friends"" nods backward to No Fences, but Hull is far from sweeping onstage via zipline, wireless mic strapped to his head. On ""You, My Pride & Me"", the band does an end-around the past 15+ years of emotionally-driven punk and plops down right in grunge territory. Hull may have been three when Bleach dropped, but his voice distantly channels a young and angry Kurt Cobain, and atop a dirge-like Black Sabbath cop to boot. When that monster riff hits, damn if I didn't yearn to pull out my nearly unplayable-for-a-decade-plus-of-scratches copies of Alice in Chains' Facelift and Dirt. And that's a good thing. Hull may claim in interviews that Weezer and Neutral Milk Hotel (yes, you read that correctly) are major influences on his songwriting, but Everything works best in a Paleolithic rock register, instead of aiming for emo-trained ears. ""One Hundred Dollars"" attempts to merge Conor Oberst with Barrett Strong's ""Money (That's What I Want)"", and it's predictably awkward, and thankfully brief. It leads to a second half of Everything on which Hull is still high-strung, but his confusion is consistently tempered by varying degrees of revelation. On the midtempo ballad ""My Friend Marcus"", Hull tells the story of a friend who lives in his basement because ""his father touched more than spirit,"" while on the title track, he confesses, again in the convoluted, Yoda-esque register of a confused, bright kid, that ""Definitely, not the things that I'm seeing, did I think I'd see so instantly."" Phew-- for a kid barely able to legally drink, Hull's got the exhaustion of middle age. And that's the thing that both defines Manchester Orchestra at this point, as well as what stops them from being great.

Yes,Pet Shop Boys,by: Douglas Wolk,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c813d1975652138b79/1:1/w_160/d620cad6.jpg,2009-04-23 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12950-yes/,Astralwerks,"Some bands, as they age, turn into hacks, banging out songs that mean nothing to them; some lose it by becoming dilettantes, groping at modish styles they don't understand. But it takes a master ironist to fall into mediocrity by embracing sincerity and scoffing at dancefloor trends-- and Pet Shop Boys' frontman Neil Tennant has built his career out of being a master ironist. That, it turns out, is why the band's 10th studio album is such a disappointment. On its surface, Yes isn't a significant departure from the style of the PSBs' better records--the same highbrow witticisms (""Love etc"" is probably the first U.K. chart single to namedrop artist Gerhard Richter), the same lavish arrangements, Tennant's soft little voice cutting through the beats. It allegedly features the duo's longtime collaborator Johnny Marr playing on a few tracks, although most of the guitar parts are bland as paste or all but inaudible or both. But the Boys have apparently forgotten the great joke of their hits' production--that Tennant, despite having one of the least robust male voices in pop history, had somehow ended up singing on disco records--and the high concept of their public persona: that Tennant put up an impressive front of arch, campy boredom to protect the tenderest of hearts. To put it another way, the brilliance of their cover of ""Always On My Mind"" was that they surrounded it with a few dozen sets of ironic quotation marks, that they were formally unequipped to support it in the manner to which it was accustomed, and that they meant it anyway. Here, though, Tennant slaps his heart on his sleeve and gets on with things. The result isn't awful, although none of it is as spooky and playful as the cover of the Passions ""I'm In Love With a German Film Star"" that the Boys produced for Sam Taylor-Wood last year. Yes has a few flashes of Tennant's old wit, especially ""All Over the World"", which lifts its biggest hook from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker March and describes itself as ""sincere and subjective... superficial and true."" ""King of Rome"" gets points for rhyming ""I couldn't be more lonely"" with ""someday you'll deign to phone me."" On the other hand, ""Love etc"" and ""Beautiful People"" are good arguments for an immediate moratorium on wealthy pop stars writing songs about how materialism is overrated and ""love is for free"" and it's stupid to ""buy the latest magazine and aspire to the dream."" (You're living some version of the dream, guys.) And ""Building a Wall"" seems to be some kind of international-relations-as-personal-relations metaphor, but doesn't take the conceit anywhere: Having come up with a solid opening line for the chorus, Tennant simply repeats it. The big source of stagnation here, though, is the music. Tennant and other-guy-in-the-band Chris Lowe made their reputation on paying attention to what was happening in dance clubs and hitching their wit and pop-sense to it, which is how they ended up collaborating with the likes of Bobby Orlando and Frankie Knuckles and Shep Pettibone in the 1980s. Yes, though, was produced by Xenomania, the pop chop-shop behind Girls Aloud's singles, leaving the Boys lagging a few years behind the sound of the UK charts when they used to be ahead of the game or at least above the fray. ""Pandemonium"" recapitulates the 6/8 lope and major/minor switcheroo of their own 1993 single ""Can You Forgive Her?"" The up-with-persons anthem ""More Than a Dream"", co-written by Xenomania, just sounds like a Girls Aloud discard. And the cryptic, bombastic slow one that ends Yes, ""Legacy"", circles around the phrase ""you'll get over it"". It's hard to tell if that's a tongue-in-cheek valediction, or if it's just Tennant and Lowe resigning themselves to disappointment.","The Pet Shop Boys grow up awkwardly, embracing sincerity and scoffing at dancefloor trends.

One Foot in the Grave,Beck,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b19d034d5c69bf2eae/1:1/w_160/3ab4155d.jpg,2009-04-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12936-one-foot-in-the-grave/,InterscopeIliad,"The year ""Loser"" charted at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 (1994, probably hoisted up by cassingle-crazy prepubescents like me), Beck actually released three full-length albums: the canonical Mellow Gold; the messy, skit-heavy Stereopathetic Soul Manure; and One Foot in the Grave, a set of ramshackle folk songs about, roughly, the apocalypse. He was 24. He was cute. He was smart, funny, and tender. Like a lot of great songwriters-- or writers, period-- he was as critical of his surroundings as he was enamored of them. He was also an entertainer, and it helped (from a marketing perspective) that his lines describing just how nigh the end is-- ""Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare/ Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber""-- doubled as the kind of kooky shit that casual, young radio listeners are powerless against. In the year of Kurt Cobain's suicide and the popular awakening of bands as indescribably bad as the Stone Temple Pilots, Beck wasn't just our ""consolation prize"" (as Spin's 20 Years of Alternative Music later called him)-- he was our escape hatch. One Foot in the Grave, out of print between 2005 and last week's merciful deluxe reissue, is a good companion to Mellow Gold, if not as essential on its own. Originally recorded for Olympia, Wash.'s stringently indie K Records (which spent the 80s tearing down the received image of the punk rockers and replacing it with research librarians and men who love embroidering), One Foot is Beck striking his most lo-effort, DIY pose-- one that fit not only into K's roster, but into an indie-music world where foot shufflers like Palace, Smog, and Pavement were getting traction. But it's also his personal take on Americana-- opener ""He's a Mighty Good Leader"" is a Skip James cover; the slide-guitar blues of ""Fourteen Rivers Fourteen Floods"" just sounds like one; and the folksy stasis of ""Sleeping Bag"" has more in common with Leonard Cohen than anything happening in the indie world. This is Beck, rustic. The guitars are not entirely in tune. His voice, removed from the matrix of samples and syncopations, sounds nasal and naïve. But his worldview-- really, what made him something much bigger than a novelty act-- is beautifully articulated. While Beck's commonly cited forebears are the Beastie Boys and Bob Dylan, his real lineage was from sculptors like Robert Rauschenberg or Claes Oldenburg: guys who turned the unusable spillover of mass production-- ""trash,"" to the trash collector-- into art. If Warhol's soup cans had a crisp, almost optimistic feel, Oldenburg's hamburger was a downer-- an unappetizing convenience that will, eventually, kill us. And One Foot in the Grave is the moment after we surrender to it: Tract homes and strip malls, a Midwest that the Hold Steady hadn't yet romanticized, the edges of Los Angeles County that money didn't whitewash-- all crushed, half-empty, a mess. It's just the trash and the couch and me and you. What's seductive about this particular doomsday scenario-- i.e., what's not depressing or urgent, or even meaningful-- is that Beck sounds relaxed. (If nobody advanced the idea in 1994, when the word was inescapable, I submit that being a slacker-- if being a slacker means ""not caring about what's going on around me""-- is a form of peace, self-preservation, or maybe even enlightenment.) Every other song on One Foot juxtaposes a world burning down (or burned out) with sitting on one's ass. I could quote forever in support, but because this isn't a book report, I'll offer one line, my favorite, from ""I've Seen the Land Beyond"": ""There's no telling who'll be dead/ When the pale horse is turning red/ And the tongues will burn in vain/ And everything will feel the same."" About half these jeremiads double as love songs, a form Beck didn't revisit in earnest again until 2002's Sea Change. While SC was unimaginatively billed as his ""mature"" album, I'm not sure that he was actually any more mature in 2002 than he was in 1994. True, the obvious ""relationship"" songs here-- ""Asshole"" (as in ""She'll do anything to make you feel like an"") and ""Girl Dreams"" (as in the ones that ""never come true"")-- lean on familiar (if funny) self-deprecation. But songs like ""Painted Eyelids"", ""It's All in Your Mind"", and ""Teenage Wastebasket"" (the latter two among the album's 16 bonus tracks) are careful, adoring, and sympathetic. (""Teenage Wastebasket"", of which we get two versions, plays like a dull slap in Neutral Milk Hotel's face: ""She is a teenage wastebasket/ Paddling up the river in a casket/ Trying to experience everything at least once/ Her life is a commercial for being fucked up."") I'm not sure that remastering an album that was already lo-fi has done much good, and I'm not sure that the bonus material here is a revelation as much as, well, just a nice bonus. The best outtake, ""It's All in Your Mind"", was actually rerecorded for Sea Change, and it's obvious why the rest of the songs didn't make the final round. What is good is that One Foot ended up back in print. Mellow Gold eclipsed it (and Stereopathetic) entirely. In a sense, that's fine-- Mellow Gold was the best of the three. But I remember eagerly buying all three at once, and realizing later that what saved Beck from being a novelty artist was not only life after ""Loser"", but the life he'd already made around it.","This set of ramshackle folk songs did as much to create the slacker ethos as Beck's more well-known 1994 release, Mellow Gold. It's also almost as good.

Kicks,1990s,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36cea9e61561daa4c8e/1:1/w_160/da0464bb.jpg,2009-04-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12886-kicks/,Rough Trade,"Expectations can be a bitch: If 1990s hadn't released such a fresh-sounding debut, maybe this follow-up wouldn't feel so stale. Cookies introduced us to the Scottish trio and surprised listeners with its cheeky wit, perky hooks, and hedonistic attitude. All of which only serves to highlight Kicks' comparable lack of laughs, spontaneity, and ease. Frankly, though, even if listeners could wipe their collective memories clean of Cookies' legacy, this album would be hard to distinguish from the throng of other UK-based bands storming our shores armed with herky-jerky guitar riffs, modish 1970s punk influences, and skinny-tie strut. Which doesn't mean that Kicks is a bad album, just that it's an indistinct one. In fairness, there are still some great songs here. Even when his jagged sound has been buffed to an unnecessarily glossy sheen, frontman Jackie McKeown has an acerbic tongue and a percussive sense of melody that can't be blunted by overproduction. ""Vondelpark"", the album opener that chronicles a pot-fueled trip to Amsterdam, makes stoner tourism sound funky. And with its psychedelic guitar solos, the track gives a self-aware wink to the hippie-ish musical styles so associated with its lyrical content. It should come as no surprise that the two songs that are credited solely to McKeown-- ""Kickstrasse"" and ""Everybody Please Relax""-- are the best of the bunch. The former, a sassy swagger of oversexed vocals and overheated distortion, represents 1990s luxuriating in their Rolling Stones fandom, complete with some disco/R&B backing vocals (courtesy of Long Blonde Kate Jackson) and hints to classic American soul songs (namely ""Respect""). The latter-- an ode to L.A. replete with Scientology references and dreamy, bright 60s pop allusions that break through the glammy guitar chug like the California sun through the clouds-- makes the best use of McKeown's sharp wit and pop culture acumen. Still, on too much of the album the band's charismatic leader is content to share his spotlight, ceding vocal duties to both of his bandmates on half of the album's 12 tracks, and relinquishing songwriting responsibilities completely to bassist Dino Bardot on two of the record's most lethargic and corniest songs (""Local Science"" and ""Sparks""). 1990s shouldn't be penalized for embracing a more communal creation process-- it's nice to see a group trying to move beyond being seen as just the project of a captivating frontman and his sidemen-- but the fact is, these growing pains are audible. Perhaps, like fellow Glaswegians Franz Ferdinand (with whom 1990s share a common lineage-- sneering pop-punk outfit Yummy Fur included members of both groups), this band will follow this misstep of a sophomore album with a revitalized third one. And perhaps time is all this trio needs to revamp their sound into something fun again. Because Kicks is not the follow-up that Cookies deserved, but its handful of winning standout tracks also suggests that its predecessor wasn't simply a fluke.","Glasgow band with herky-jerky guitar riffs and plenty of sneering attitude returns with a second album, once again produced by Bernard Butler.

Never Gonna Touch the Ground,Still Flyin',by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3adea9e61561daa4d33/1:1/w_160/bed69b49.jpg,2009-04-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12932-never-gonna-touch-the-ground/,Ernest Jenning,"The popular image of the typical indie-rock concertgoer is that of a guy standing stock still, arms crossed, unmoving and seemingly unmoved by whatever music he is hearing. When things get intense, he nods his head approvingly; when he cuts loose, his foot will tap. Whether or not that cliché is accurate (Dear couple dancing near the stage at the Beirut show in D.C.: Thank you. Sincerely, Stephen), Still Flyin' exists seemingly to combat that image and those social reservations: A multinational party band based out of San Francisco but claiming members from as far away as Norway and Australia, the group infuses every moment of its full-length debut, Never Gonna Touch the Ground, with movement-- skittering beats, elastic basslines, snappy guitar riffs, ecstatic sing-alongs, all with the goal of making their audiences uncross their arms and maybe even dance. Sometimes Still Flyin' come across as over-evangelical in this tacit mission, sounding either maniacally insistent or dopily precious, but you can't say they aren't trying. Back in 2004, Sean Rawls, formerly of Athens, Ga., outfits Masters of the Hemisphere and Je Suis France, created Still Flyin' as a loosely defined jam band, and its constantly mutating line-up has included musicians who spend their day jobs in the Aislers Set, Rafter, Maserati, Love Is All, and Architecture in Helsinki. Because of the choir of female back-up singers punctuating Rawls' lead vocals, Still Flyin' will no doubt draw comparisons to the Polyphonic Spree or I'm From Barcelona, and because of its liberal use of white-guy reggae beats, the band may be lumped in with 311 and Matisyahu. They're cool with being uncool, though. What makes Never Gonna Touch the Ground so intriguing, however, isn't any one aspect like vocals or beats, but the entire overstuffed package. Just as the band gathers members from all over the world, so too does it draw influences globally. Afropop guitars twist and coil throughout ""Forever Dudes"" and ""Good Thing It's a Ghost Town Around Here"", while ""Dead Memory Man"" and ""Aerosmith Take Me... to the Other Side"" politely skank on reggae and ska beats. Shout-outs to Eddy Grant's ""Electric Avenue"" and Lipps Inc.'s ""Funky Town"" jostle elbows with nods to Swedish pop and show-tune punk, and it's all channeled through a North American indie sensibility, although one self-aware enough to counter knowingness with an exuberance bordering on silly. If Never Gonna Touch the Ground is Up With People covering Broken Social Scene, then some of these sing-alongs may be too complex to sing along with. That doesn't stop ""Good Thing It's a Ghost Town Around Here"" from unpacking its hooks one by one, each a little catchier than the previous. And ""The Hott Chord Is Struck"" spells out part of its title like cheerleaders at a pep rally. They got spirit. Unfortunately, that free-bird sensibility also means there are some dead-end interstitials during which Still Flyin' actually do touch the ground. Ten years ago, ""Act of Jamming"" would have been a hidden track on this CD, but it gets prime placement immediately following ""Ghost Town"". That's not progress. It's a half-assed half-groove that starts with a bass line straight out of a Stax revue, but doesn't build to anything at all. ""Haunted Houses"" in particular is a soggy gospel about the visceral joys of horror movies, yet its slack pace and dull sense of import communicate no such thrills. If Never Gonna Touch the Ground is less a party album and more an album as party-- self-contained, relentlessly upbeat, rowdy, self-celebratory-- too many of these songs come across as kegs of near beer.","This multinational party band based out of San Francisco infuses every moment of its full-length debut with movement.

Winter Hours,The Deep Dark Woods,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36213d1975652138a97/1:1/w_160/3079c1b7.jpg,2009-04-22 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12879-winter-hours/,Black Hen,"What do candy, lipstick, and country music have in common? When the job market's as dry as an Arizona ditch in August and flour canisters start subbing for IRA accounts, consumption historically trends towards confections, cosmetics, and calamity narratives. I'll let economists and Adbusters types unpack the first two, but the last needs no explaining: Even without 20-foot high billboard titles like ""All the Money I Had Is Gone"" and ""The Sun Never Shines"", banjos, fiddles, and twangy vocals just plain old holler HARD TIMES. More important, country music's accoutrements signal the inclusive, populist sentiment that we're all in this mess together-- even when the actions of hedge fund managers and insurance company executives say otherwise. Put it this way: When the Coen brothers wanted to gently mock earnest Depression-era social realism while also acknowledging that capitalism indeed co-opts everything in its path, including music and misery, they used ""old-timey"" ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" as shorthand. I doubt it's an intentional act of class warfare, but with the release of their third full-length album, Winter Hours, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, alt-country band Deep Dark Woods could hit cultural paydirt. As Winter Hours' warm and fully fleshed string arrangements, quaint subjects and syntax, and willingness to let its bluegrass hang out (particularly on ""Nancy"" and ""As I Roved Out"") imply, the quartet isn't especially shy of the ""country"" part of that taxonomy or, despite coming from rock backgrounds, anxious to prove their ""alt"" credentials. And harmony-heavy, traditional-sounding folk is having its moment. Venn diagram the record collections of Deep Dark Woods and Pitchfork's 2008 album list topper Fleet Foxes and you'd round up a sizeable stack of Neil Young, Gram Parsons, and the Band LPs. But while Fleet Foxes have taken their influences and crafted them into pretty, abstract musical excursions and ahistorical hymns to nature, Deep Dark Woods work the material, storytelling aspects of the tradition. Winter Hours abounds with ballads about small mistakes swollen large, petty misunderstandings never mended, poverty, heartbreak, death, and a whole lot of wandering in the wilderness. (The album's only public-domain standard, ""When First Into This Country"", pretty much nails all of those in one whack.) ""All the Money I Had Is Gone"" is the album's standout, a gentle highway-strip-tracing pedal steel and banjo number in which a self-described ""wayward son"" calls out ""All the greedy hands/ That live around this land"" and also admits his part in his penurious position. Strike any chords? Singer and primary songwriter Ryan Boldt's steady tone is mournful but not maudlin, as he recounts disasters in ""The Gallows"", ""Two Time Loser"", and ""Farewell"", the album's counter-intuitively titled lead track about marriage and murder. Despite some Pinetop Seven-recalling gothic textures (""The Birds on the Bridge"", written by bassist Chris Mason, is a sinister paean to paranoia) and jam-banding noodles (""The Sun Never Shines""), Deep Dark Woods-- particularly Boldt-- keep emotions tightly wrapped, opaque. This is both to the album's advantage and detriment. Storytelling needs a narrator, preferably a reliable, sympathetic one that's easy on the ears, but it also needs a strong voice capable of venting horror, frustration, sadness, anger, outrage. And god knows we've got enough to be outraged about these days.","Harmony-heavy Canadian alt-country band channels influences like Gram Parsons and the Band on songs that speak to current economic hardships.

Asleep in the Bread Aisle,Asher Roth,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ac13d1975652138b33/1:1/w_160/d4f4f0f7.jpg,2009-04-22 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12931-asleep-in-the-bread-aisle/,Universal Motown,"Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before. And yet, here we are, a decade removed from The Slim Shady LP and before even selling one record, MC Asher Roth has generated opinions so ingrained one way or the other that for all intents and purposes, his debut album, Asleep in the Bread Aisle, might as well be a blank disc. There are those who celebrate the chance that any new artist becomes able to move units, even if he's being marketed to white, affluent hip-hop buyers seeking to relate to a rapper in a completely non-allegorical sense. And then there are those who've heard ""I Love College"" and find the use of hip-hop as a vehicle to express leisure class privilege as a bit... troubling, to say the least. Beyond that, ""I Love College"" is seen as a mutant strain of hipster-rap that completely evolved into frat-rap in the literal sense. And let's face it, you probably haven't heard ""frat"" used as a word to positively describe a lot of music since Otis Day & the Knights. I don't know about myself, man. If he wasn't a star-in-the-making and I wasn't some hatin' ass hater, I bet Asher Roth and I would probably get along. We both had Jewish upbringings in the same part of Pennsylvania. Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life was a formative listening experience for each of us. He too likes Butterscotch Krimpets. And I've had an easy go of things, really-- I fucking loved college. Then again, my memories might not be so fond if I was subjected to hearing ""I Love College"" and the rest of Asleep in the Bread Aisle at every party for the next four years, give or take a semester or three.  I'll probably only get to say this once, but frat boys deserve better. Topicality isn't a sticking point, especially when hip-hop is almost always richer for having pioneers who are willing to shatter preconceptions of what it's ""okay"" to rap about-- see Eminem and Kanye, the 21st century's biggest stars and two rappers who set the stage for Roth's career in their own way. And surely, someone can be the William Styron of this rap shit, writing vividly about college parties, so ripe for exploration from a keen eye with its pungent sensory overload-- the smell of a beer-sticky basement, the sobering chill of a bleary walk home, the fact that any pizza joint that sells a slice for a buck is probably a drug front. Instead, and maybe this is the point, by trying to embody a universal experience, Roth reps for no one in particular and just becomes that asshole yelling ""CHUG, FRESHMAN!"" turning in the most laughably out-of-touch account of campus culture since I Am Charlotte Simmons. At least Tom Wolfe had the excuse of being 50 years older than Roth. I wouldn't harp on ""I Love College"" if it wasn't so indicative of the hedge-betting callowness that defines the rest of the record. In his haste to blend in and not offend any of the bigwigs he's got in his corner, Roth paradoxically confirms the prejudice that maybe those in his position really don't have anything to say. Most of the time, particularly on ""Lark On My Go-Kart"", he revels in rapid-fire ""Family Guy""-style references that become failed jokes-- in the first verse alone, he's already namedropped Teddy Ruxpin, Little Miss Muffet, blumpkins, Kelly Kapowski, and Lark Voorhies. And for what? More often, even topics that are more germane to the listener lack any detail that could take them past mere talking points-- relationships are a hassle (""Be By Myself"", featuring a putrid Cee-Lo hook), the rap game is a struggle (""La Di Da""), the government's probably up to something (""Sour Patch Kids""). Even the most specified tracks fail miserably, yet differently: Not that either event is his fault, but in light of Nick Adenhart's tragic death and Andy Reid's drug-addled son getting busted in a parking lot 20 minutes from where Roth grew up, advocating smoking marijuana while operating a motor vehicle (""Blunt Cruisin'"") is tough to swallow even before its slapdash, annoying composition puts the listener in the sober mindset of a designated driver with a long night ahead of him. Yeah, the beats-- they're pretty good. Not everything's as elephant walk-obvious as ""I Love College"", but there's a dusty, rock-oriented sound to a lot of these that could draw comparisons to Danger Mouse or Edan's Beauty and the Beat if anyone still listened to it. You're not here for those. Maybe you're here for the record's sole line of defensive, ""As I Em"", in which Roth raps exactly like Eminem (to the point of mania) and then complains about interviewers having the nerve to ask him about it.  Bubba Sparxxx made a similar lament during the last verse of ""Nowhere"", but his point hit home-- unlike Roth, he was a vet by that point, and he did so at a time when literally finding the next Eminem was something major labels actually did (hold your heads, Haystak and Lil Wyte). That and he also had Timbaland, whereas Roth's brothers in arms are talentless Perez Hilton-heads Chester French, whose whole career is owed to Vampire Weekend and MGMT not having gone to state schools. It's here where this entire internet-bubble beta-male rap game reveals how far up its own ass it is: Roth is defending himself against backlash, second-album ""I've seen some shit""-style, before anyone cared enough to start it. Of course, Roth has an army of bloggers hungry for a piece of that A&R action, and they insinuate any dismissal of Roth is borne out of self-loathing. And yet the only rapper willing to be on the same track with the guy is legendary hermit Busta Rhymes, who shows up on the double-time showcase ""Lion's Roar"" and still exhibits some phoned-in dominance of his host. Surely these aren't guys who'd cosign on a weak artist in the interest of commerce! Why can't you ride for his cause? But it's not a self-loathing thing, and it's not a race thing-- Asleep feels less like an album of music meant to entertain than an assumption that you can actually bump a marketing plan in your cars and house parties. Whether or not Asher Roth is some sort of sign that hip-hop is dead, there's no doubt that he's proof that the music industry is still very much alive.","Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before.

Sounds of the Universe,Depeche Mode,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3bab1335d7bf16987bc/1:1/w_160/d70aa252.jpg,2009-04-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12940-sounds-of-the-universe/,MuteCapitol,"""They're a singles band,"" sniffed a friend, dismissing Depeche Mode's influential career. Even if one were to agree with that blithe assessment, there's no way Depeche Mode could be dismissed as just a singles band, given their track record on the charts and in the clubs, a string of hits that have hung in there to varying degrees of ubiquity. Sure, the singles sometimes remain standouts, but the rest of the tracks-- especially on albums like Music for the Masses and Violator-- are hardly filler. For better or for worse-- and those who miss the band's more subversive early days may think it's for the worse-- Depeche Mode have gotten in the habit of crafting complete start-to-finish statements. Yet it's still unclear where Depeche Mode fits into today's pop world. The group is currently selling out stadiums around the globe, which attests to its ongoing popularity, and unlike many other acts of its vintage still manages to attract fans that span demographics. But Depeche Mode are also a far cry from the pioneers they once were, let alone the leaders they grew to become. It's almost as if the band has stepped aside to a parallel track, content in its place; more cachet, more cool, more money-- they'll take it if they can get it, but they sure don't need it. So, yes, the days of earth-quaking, Zeitgeist-shifting Depeche Mode awesomeness may likely be behind them, but that doesn't make Sounds of the Universe any less worthy of the band's legacy. If the album as usual seems to have little or no bearing on anything outside the group's own, um, universe, the wheels and gears are definitely still turning and churning in the Depeche Mode machine. Martin Gore can still be counted on to deliver the goods, and recent songwriting convert Dave Gahan is impatiently nipping at his heels. Gahan's singing, meanwhile, is as strong as ever, always the perfect vehicle for Gore's lyrics, and the glue that holds together even the disc's most diffuse songs. And really, Sounds of the Universe is, at 60 minutes and 13 songs-- the group's longest player to date-- relatively loose and sprawling, as likely to drift as hit hard. While the group's brought back producer Ben Hillier, Sounds of the Universe is a very different album from its predecessor, Playing the Angel. ""In Chains"" begins like how one imagines it would feel to be on the receiving end of a SETI signal before stretching into an epic-- satisfyingly dramatic and dynamic despite its leisurely seven-minute gait-- and deceptively full of activity despite what feels like an intentional ear for minimalism. ""Hole to Feed"", a Gahan composition, is similarly busy yet spare, bounding along a sci-fi take on the Bo Diddley beat while Gahan (his troubled history public record) draws on double meanings and innuendo to project the band's trademark narcissistic portent. The song doesn't know how to end, but that just makes the entrance of ""Wrong"" that much more theatrical. That song-- the single-- is short but deliciously sour, hearkening back to the band's synthier days without losing the layer of grunge it's carefully cultivated post-Violator, a strategy also reflected by ""Fragile Tension"" (which wouldn't have been out of place on the generally noisier Angel). ""Little Soul"" and ""In Sympathy"", however, once again echo old-school minimalist Depeche menace and pop smarts, respectively, which makes ""Peace""-- sounding like Kraftwerk gone dreamy gospel-- that much more striking. It's a stirring encapsulation of all of Depeche Mode's different sides and qualities, reminiscent of all those other great album tracks lurking throughout the group's catalog. Yet a funny thing happens next. With the strong but still oddly static Gahan composition ""Come Back"", the album starts to feel a little fractured, and by the time the effortlessly melodic ""Perfect"" comes around, followed by the casually industrial ""Miles Away/The Truth Is"", the synth-lounge ""Jezebel"", and the fuzzy closer ""Corrupt"", it's almost as if we've embarked on another album entirely. Either that or the band's simply left us to find our way through their space. Ending with a brief, queasy reprise tease of ""Wrong"", Sounds of the Universe concludes anticlimactically, an echo of its promising start.","The days of Zeitgeist-shifting Depeche Mode awesomeness may likely be behind them, but that doesn't make their new LP less worthy of the band's legacy.

Worldwild,Pterodactyl,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c0ea9e61561daa4d5a/1:1/w_160/beacd6e7.jpg,2009-04-21 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12946-worldwild/,JagjaguwarBrah,"Pterodactyl play a familiar brand of exuberant, sunburned psychedelic-inspired indie-- not too far off from Oneida, the godfathers of the Brah label which is now releasing the band's second album. Their debut was contagiously manic while being simply, satisfyingly melodic; Worldwild sticks to the same basic sound, but offers grander gestures and a more layered listen. If the album has a loose theme, it hovers around the search for a spiritual bond with the planet, with lyrics about waterfalls and ambling journeys into the woods. A lot of Worldwild has the band honing its normally loud, boisterous elements into mimicking nature, like the tribal rhythm and singsong chant of ""February"" or the cascading melody and layers of ""Old Clouds"". Despite the healthy amount of noise the band can work up, headphone listening reveals ambitious touches like the high-pitched harmonies hovering over lurching, stop-start rhythms in ""Rising & Shining"" and ""First Daze"".The record's best tracks such as ""Share the Shade"" fold the mania of earlier Pterodactyl songs like ""Polio"" into something that barrels through a few hairpin turns instead of remaining straightforward, while the rhythm section keeps its tectonic rumble at top speed. Drummer Matt Marlin has always been the band's not-so-secret weapon, so it's a surprise that one of the album's most affecting songs begins without any percussion at all: The vocal in ""December"" offers breathless narration over a plaintive morse-code pulse of guitar, providing one of the record's most sparse and gorgeous moment Much of Worldwild either drifts or holds back; even its more immediate songs seem wary of being too melodically obvious or offering too much catharsis at once. On their debut, Pterodactyl were figuring out who they were as a band, but the inertia of their songs ably distracted from the record's seams. Here, there's some familiar patterns, but between breaks for acoustic primitivism and sound-collage interludes, they still seem to be figuring things out-- all while trying to put together a more cohesive album. While the highlights like ""Share the Sound"" or ""No Sugar"" refine the band's sound into something more sophisticated yet brawny, their attempts to make all of it congeal into a whole is what feels forced. It's not that the band shouldn't be ambitious, or that putting together a more coherent end-to-end listening experience is a bad thing. But Worldwild is just their second album; did they have to grow up so fast?","Pterodactyl play a familiar brand of exuberant, sunburned psychedelic-inspired indie-- not too far off from labelmates Oneida.

Suckers EP,Suckers,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c113d1975652138b69/1:1/w_160/eb011eb9.jpg,2009-04-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12947-suckers-ep/,IAMSOUND,"An increasingly whispered-about Brooklyn four-piece with a warehouse-commune aesthetic that Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal accurately described as ""fourth-generation hippie flotsam,"" Suckers' debut, four-song EP kneels before sonic idols (David Byrne, Isaac Brock) that actually share little in common with the band's sartorial affectations. Where most EPs put their best foot forward, here Suckers close with their strongest song to date: ""It Gets Your Body Movin'"", which does just as the song's title suggests and more-- it gets you singing as well. Call it a strong first impression and mixtape ammo. Built around a base of tribal drums and waterlogged guitars, ""It Gets Your Body Movin'"" lives and dies by its titular refrain, five words that-- laced with a lazy bit of whistling-- crescendo and build and expand before bursting outright. By measure of sheer collective sing-a-long voltage, one could tag the song an ""anthem"" and call it a day. But on a short release stuffed with and defined by oversized, campfire vocal confetti, I'm not sure how well the descriptor really captures the psychotropic pop spaces and grooves that Suckers and producer Anand Wilder (of fellow Brooklyn indie-rock mystics Yeasayer) are gunning for. This feels much more communal or even experiential than what that word connotes. This feels like a reason to hold hands and beat your chest, not place the former over the latter. Though the approach or rhythm differs, that vibe pervades throughout. On ""Beach Queen"", lead vocalist Quinn Walker sounds every bit as Byrne-nian on his own as Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Alec Ounsworth did when he arrived four years ago. The vocal hook isn't nearly as fetching as the way the synths melt into one another, but that itch to join in remains. ""Easy Chairs"" opens with a bit of PCP barber-shop harmonizing before skipping off at a pace befitting its ""Ring Around the Rosies"" melody. ""Afterthoughts & TV"" boasts a galloping chorus that, while every bit as exuberant as ""Movin'"", features a buffet of instrumentation (horn explosions, piano, twang) that hints further at a band with an ear for more. Just four songs in and we've got a very satisfying, very clear idea of what to expect. To have more would be sweet, to continue to be plesantly surprised even better.","This increasingly whispered-about Brooklyn four-piece shares sonic similarities with Yeasyer, and could soon follow them to indie success.

The Planets Are Blasted,Boston Spaceships,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39813d1975652138b09/1:1/w_160/bdc74df7.jpg,2009-04-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12916-the-planets-are-blasted/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","Drinking buddies, well-wishers, and pen-pals Bob Pollard's got in droves; what the guy needs is a band. The best of the records Pollard helmed under the Guided by Voices name in the mid-1990s were laid down wherever an outlet could be found by Pollard and a fairly tight crew of four-tracking cronies. Although they'd have plenty of successes after the post-Under the Bushes dissolution of the band's ""classic"" lineup, that core of Pollard, Tobin Sprout, Mitch Mitchell, and Kevin Fennell is still Bob's band to beat. Sure, these days Pollard's got as many musical pseudonyms as he's got auxiliary recycling bins-- the Circus Devils, the Takeovers, this new Cosmos thing with Richard Davies, to name but a few-- and his frequent collaborations with producer and multi-instrumentalist Todd Tobias is as close to a working relationship as any Pollard's had over the years. But fans knew something was up when Pollard took the Spaceships out for their maiden voyage last fall, following the release of their stellar debut, Brown Submarine, announcing all the while to anyone sober enough to remember that its follow-up was already in the can. It's clear the Boston Spaceships is Pollard's new band, not just another project. It's clearer still, after a couple records in less than six months' time, that the man's pretty okay with that. As he should be. Brown Submarine was, until recently, the single finest LP Pollard's been associated with since the dissolution of Guided by Voices in the middle of this decade. Now-- but only by a nose-- The Planets Are Blasted has staked its claim on that increasingly less dubious title. The breezy Brown Submarine brimmed with hooks and neat little instrumental flourishes and, most important, vitality. Picking up where that record let off, The Planets Are Blasted most often than not just rips, opting for a slurry Zeppelin-y stomp even at the expense of some of its predecessor's catchiness. To my ears, Pollard hasn't put out a good ol' drinking record like this one in forever: heady, quick to inspire the raising of glasses, with complexities that linger far after the initial buzz wears off. It certainly doesn't hurt that Pollard's once again brought nothing but good stuff to the party. There was hardly a song worth saving on January's miserable solo LP The Crawling Distance, but Pollard's just piling 'em on here, matching bouncy verse with tension-building pre-chorus to fist-pumping tagline in nearly every song. What could've been a trio of memorable little one-minute ditties at the back end of Alien Lanes become knotty, breathless three-minute barnstormers on The Planets Are Blasted; take, for example, the fantastic ""Tattoo Mission"", which matches a beery groove of a verse or two into a swirling Slusarenko-arranged string hook that positively explodes into sweetly symphonic pop through its last minute. Too often, Pollard's recent tunes are lucky to get two out of the three right, but here, even the weak spots seem to carry their weight, propelled by some of the most engaged-sounding Pollard vocal performances in memory. More credit must be given to drummer John Moen and particularly guitarist/bassist Chris Slusarenko, who helped buoy Brown Submarine and keep Planets Are Blasted moving ever-skyward. Moen's just got more to play with here than he did on the fairly straightforward Submarine songs, and his burly tromping keep the big moments pumping through your chest long after they're over. But it's Slusarenko who's really got Pollard's number, filling in the blanks in the tunes with punchy bass work and note-perfect guitar stabs. Instrumentally, Pollard's solo work all too often zigs when it seems stupid not to zag. But Slursarenko seems to have a clear sense of how best to serve the songs, and when to get the hell out of the way. Even a relative lowlight like ""Catherine From Mid-October"", which suffers from the same dowdy structural bloat as a lot of Pollard's 00s cuts, manages just finen thanks in no small part to Slusarenko's steady hand. There's a passage in ""Sight on Sight"" where the slightly distended thump the song eases into after minute one slides into a sprightly acoustic guitar line that eventually settles into another, better tune. That moment right there is in many ways the perfect distillation of what makes these Spaceships work; Pollard's operating in the mode he's always been best in (Bee Thousand is made up of transitions, after all) and sounding better than he has in years, with a couple of guys behind him who seem to understand what fits and what doesn't. In many ways, Pollard's still Pollard-- lyrically inscrutable, as generous with hooks as he is with bewildering sonic left-turns, and probably slightly mad-- but the Pollard who made the Planets Are Blasted sounds a lot more like the guy still blowing Dayton School District paychecks on beer and Maxells some 15 years back than whoever it was who laid The Crawling Distance on us. And, if the guys making the racket behind him might not be Mitch and Kevin and Toby, they're doing a better job of it than anybody who's come along since. Robert Pollard needs a band, and we oughta be awfully glad he's settled on this one.","Two albums in, Robert Pollard's new band is proving to be the vehicle for some of his best music since the dissolution of Guided by Voices.

Art Brut vs. Satan,Art Brut,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3825e6ef95969320673/1:1/w_160/99b16b29.jpg,2009-04-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12902-art-brut-vs-satan/,Cooking VinylDowntown,"Spoiler alert: Art Brut lose. Of course they do. Tramps like former Art Brut tourmates Hold Steady were born to run around wearing baseball jerseys in front of Counting Crows fans (and good for them!). Art Brut were born to lose: How could they ever improve on the clumsy meta-punk rush of their first single, ""Formed a Band""? They arrived almost fully formed. They never got to play ""Top of the Pops"". When they miraculously came up with another 11 songs just about as good-- or, in the case of ""Emily Kane"", arguably better-- on their brilliant 2005 debut album, Bang Bang Rock & Roll, it only added sting to their inevitable defeat. They were even losers at being losers. I loved them for it. That's partly why it's so strange now to read reviews that lump Art Brut in with more commercially successful UK bands such as Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand. At live shows, lead not-quite-singer Eddie Argos used to change ""I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground"" to ""I can't stand the sound of Gang of Four,"" and I always assumed his targets were obvious (hint: neither the Velvet Underground nor Gang of Four). Full of fist-pumping but self-mocking bar-punk about obsessive fandom and romantic awkwardness, Bang Bang Rock & Roll was the closest our decade has come to The Modern Lovers. Art Brut's true peers are lyrical music geeks like John Darnielle, Jeffrey Lewis, Jens Lekman, Los Campesinos!, the Tough Alliance, and, most recently, Nodzzz. It's not irony; it's self-aware sincerity. Good news for people who love losers: Art Brut's third album is on what Kanye might call ""some Benjamin Buttons shit."" Gone is the slight maturation of their good-- but, sadly, not great-- sophomore album, 2007's It's a Bit Complicated, which tried to win by the attractive-people rules of polished production; the songs were still warm, witty, and alive, but they just didn't have the original's ""I've seen her naked-- TWICE!"" brashness. Recorded on the fly with fellow Jonathan Richman acolyte Frank Black, Art Brut vs. Satan is a scrappy, romantic, and painfully hilarious return to loserdom. Coldplay will always be more popular. So what? I hate those guys! Art Brut probably do, too. If they can't topple vague, pasty, barely breathing background rock from the charts, at least they can sing gloriously doomed songs about it. ""Cool your warm jets, Brian Eno,"" Argos jibes on ""Slap Dash for No Cash"", teasing shiny U2 clones the way he previously skewered vapid post-punk revivalists. Argos champions instead the records where you can hear not only the crack of the singer's voice, or the squeak of the guitarist's fingers, but also (as on a Gorky's Zygotic Mynci B-side, apparently) their parents complaining about the volume-- not because those records are more artistically valid, or more authentic or whatever, but for a more important reason: ""Those are the records I like."" Black gets the Art Brut spirit down on record better than anyone has before, with the blazing pop-metal vainglory of Weezer, the scruffy cheekiness of early Rough Trade bands, and lots of enthusiastic backing vocals. Fun for them, fun for us. ""Demons Out!"" shifts the Smiths' ""Panic!"" from hanging DJs to denying record buyers suffrage, but don't mistake it for a Death Cab for Cutie-like manifesto against U.S. Auto-Tune pop; more accurately, it's an ideal rebuke against the endless Travis Kooks Kaiser Chiefs Razorlight blandness of UK ""science museum"" rock. So too ""The Replacements"", which melds the Mats' ""Alex Chilton"" and the Brut's ""My Little Brother"" into a clamorous endorsement of used CDs and deluxe reissues. Extending the prior album's trend toward sacrilegious song titles, ""Twist and Shout"" may not have you accidentally repeating its off-key la-la-las in public, like the song's narrator, but you'll probably know exactly how he feels. Not that Satan gives a damn about songs that communicate aspects of everyday life with clarity and human charm. Art Brut remain ever the underdog when they're singing about arrested development and girls, too. ""DC Comics and Chocolate Milkshake"" is a cereal-eaters' song as universal as Jerry Seinfeld, with a nicely echoing bridge, while perfectly sloppy public-transportation anthem ""The Passenger"" rewrites Iggy Pop from the perspective of a guy who can't drive. ""Summer Job"", with its Vampire Weekend-whooping intro vocal, is the album's only concession to conventional melody, and its summertime-blues-curing slackerdom could hardly be more enjoyably juvenile. Like a bizarro ""Rusted Guns of Milan"", ""What a Rush"" fumbles for morning-after Beatles vs. Stones meaning-- and socks. Add to vocab: ""Sober...ish?"". Slowing down but not going ballad, ""Am I Normal?"" is a preview of the kind of shy neurotic who might go on to write ""Emily Kane"". Art Brut Vs. Satan begins and ends with a hungover Argos trying to remember what he did the night before. Frantically buzzing opener ""Alcoholics Unanimous"" finds Argos sending apologetic mass texts; he's been concerned about what he's been up to, and with good reason. On epic finale ""Mysterious Bruises"", which I didn't even notice was seven minutes until I looked it up later, Argos proclaims: ""I fought the floor and the floor won."" Satan always wins. The beautiful people and their sycophants will always outnumber lovable losers. But this is a record I like.","Recorded on the fly with ex-Pixie Frank Black, Art Brut vs. Satan is Eddie Argos' scrappy, romantic, and painfully hilarious return to loserdom.

My Maudlin Career,Camera Obscura,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3bc13d1975652138b5c/1:1/w_160/f0616c8e.jpg,2009-04-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12942-my-maudlin-career/,4AD,"On the title track of Camera Obscura's fourth album, My Maudlin Career, Tracyanne Campbell sings, ""This maudlin career has come to an end/ I don't want to be sad again."" As usual, she's being sincerely ironic. Camera Obscura fans will be pleased to know that she's still turning out maudlin torch songs with apparent ease. It is a record of the most immoderate sentiment: Thirty seconds in, on ""French Navy"", you've already got a dusty library, a French sailor, and the moon on the silvery lake. By the second track, ""The Sweetest Thing"", Campbell's ready to trade her mother for a compliment from a certain someone. She might not want to be sad again, but judging from the kind of tangled romantic assignations she confesses to here? Album number five already lurks in the inevitable fallout. The sonic similarities and early connections between Camera Obscura and fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian have already been flogged to death; what's less often mentioned is that they're also growing up parallel. Both began as lo-fi indie-pop bands with heads full of classic pop radio. Over time, both shifted their emphasis toward crafting classic-sounding songs in various Western pop idioms while retaining traces of their button-badge origins. More timid incarnations of Camera Obscura dissolved their genre exercises into a sort of equalizing cuddliness; on My Maudlin Career, the band's confidence draws them into sharper relief. You'll hear traces of 1950s beach music on ""The Sweetest Thing"", country on ""Forest and Sands"", and bubbly orch-pop all over the place. The album feels as if it could have been released any time in the last 50-odd years, but the inspired arrangements-- and, of course, Campbell's indelible voice-- make it sound fresh, too. ""Refinement"" is the watchword on My Maudlin Career, and there are two particular developments of note. One is the string arrangements, which are kinda out of control. They buffet the verses relentlessly, taking over entirely whenever the jubilation reaches such a feverish pitch that words can no longer express it-- check out the deliriously up-swirling end of ""Careless Love"". It's as if George Gershwin stormed the studio. A weaker band might have floundered under the weight, which brings us to the second notable development: Campbell's singing retains its vulnerable-but-tough naiveté, but it sounds more assertive and agile, with increased swing and soul, than ever before. There are still melodies of heart-wrenching simplicity that stick in your head to an almost irritating degree (beware of the dangerously catchy ""James""), balanced by songs with longer, more complex and limber melodic phrases. It's a singing style one wants to call ""mature."" And maturity is a central concept to Camera Obscura-- Campbell's found it in her singing, but in her lyrics, the search continues. The asymmetries in her personality give her songs their distinct character. She still has that bitingly sarcastic, even cynical side, which lends a flinty edge to the sentimentality. Even in an adoring ode to a sailor boyfriend, she takes a moment to derisively mention his ""dietary restrictions."" And on the rollicking ""Swans"", you can practically hear her rolling her eyes when she sings, ""So you want to be a writer? Fantastic idea!"" Sarcasm seems to be a defense mechanism for Campbell, one that's necessary because of two very pronounced and conflicting personality traits. On one hand, she's a hopeless romantic. On the other, she's very cautious, and somewhat pessimistic. These contrary impulses create the tragically beautiful situations in her songs. The fear of getting lost crops up frequently-- at least twice on this album. So does the fear of public opinion, which rears its head on ""French Navy"": ""I'll be criticized for lending out my art/ I was criticized for letting you break my heart."" Campbell is striving for equilibrium in adult relationships but keeps falling back into teenage predicaments. Her meditations on maturity, responsibility, and healthy love give the record its darker, more serious overtones. On ""Away with Murder"", over sullen minor-key organs, she contemplates the point where support shades into enabling: ""How many times have you told me you want to die?"" The question of what we owe the people we love, and what we can reasonably expect from them in return, is the backdrop for all the romance and depression. People are always showing up at Campbell's door when she doesn't want them to, or not showing up when she does. Being beholden in this way seems to frustrate and attract her in equal measure. Luckily for us, until this schism is resolved, her maudlin career should continue to play out apace.","Latest from these Glaswegian indie-poppers blends 1950s beach music, country, and bubbly orch-pop to complement their alternately romantic and cynical lyrics.

Mother of Curses,D.

At its best, the group worked like AC/DC remixed by Pablo Picasso, thrillingly off-kilter cubist-rock that rearranged itself in real time. At its worst, well, at least the band never stopped trying to keep people on their toes. Regardless, the past is the past, and U.S. Maple guitarist Todd Rittman has moved on, and on again, first with Singer, a sort-of supergroup (for those with low supergroup standards) featuring members of 90 Day Men and Town and Country, and now with D. Rider, a no less (but no more) supergroup teaming Rittman with Cheer-Accident's keyboardist/cornet player Andrea Faught and Mucca Pazza reedist Noah Tabakin. ""Make no mistake,"" warns the press notes. ""This is not art-house studio meanderings. This is a rock record."" Actually, it's a little of both. Any disc that enlists scribbling magic marker as an instrument definitely passes the ""art-house studio meanderings"" test, but at the same time, that track, ""Arranged Marriage to No Toms"", does indeed rock, sort of. It's the best of both worlds for eggheads and bobbing heads alike. The dirgy ""Dew Claw Don't Claw"" rocks, too (sort of), its weird menace leading up to a guitar anti-solo that sounds a little like a modem locked in mortal battle with a dentist's drill (we'll call it a draw). ""Body to Body (to Body)"" is no less abrasive in its deconstructionist instincts, constantly turning in on itself while stuttered along a fitfully funky groove. While ""Welcome Out"" at first seems to be offering an acoustic guitar respite, finding some shared vision between jazz and folk. But then the deceptively stirring song leads to what could be its electric companion piece ""Dear Blocks"", this one introduced by the sound of a spray paint can being shaken and discharged before sinewy guitars and oddly-accented drums lock in with one another, synths begin to squelch, horns bleat, and the track peters out anti-climatically. The same thing happens with ""Misery Whip"", which does a disservice to its awesome title and primordial riff, and really that's the problem with a lot of Mother of Curses. Too often, D. Rider sound (sometimes literally) like a scratch pad, like they're still working out where they wants to go even as the tape rolls. The music here is intriguing, sometimes mysterious, and does often rock. Or, at least, sort of rock, a little like U.S. Maple did, by trying to redefine what rocking even means. Yet even the most promising grooves, like ""Touchy"" or the jarring ""Marksman"", go nowhere in the end. Crafting art-house meanderings that rock turns out to be the easy part. It's sticking the landing that's hard, and no matter how much D. Rider twists, turns and tumbles in midair, they're just not there yet.","Todd Rittman of 90s cult act U.S. Maple has a new band, and he's still interested in finding new ways to deconstruct rock.

It's like the guy's singing through the wall."" On one level, my friend's right. Jason Quever's one-man (plus guests) band makes blurred-edge music with damp organs, milky guitars, reverbed vocals, and sticky, half-familiar melodies seemingly snatched from some collective unconscious. And the album's opening couplet, ""Once we walked in the sunlight/ Three years ago this July 4th"", sums up Papercuts' temperamental pitch with tweet-like brevity. Their 2007 LP was titled Can't Go Back, but as a songwriter Quever can't help but indulge nostalgia, including its bitter constituents, regret and remorse. Papercuts, however, aren't agoraphobic shut-ins exorcising romantic demons and venting life's inequities. A backward-- and inward—looking predilection actually serves the band artistically. Quever crafts his aesthetic from the raw materials of Zombies, Velvet Underground, and Galaxie 500 appreciation, Phil Spector worship, and an indie rock gospel that equates modest ambitions with really, really meaning it. And the Bay Area singer-songwriter has buffed this sound to a rose-colored finish playing in and touring with 60s-rock fetishists Vetiver and pop deconstructionists Beach House and Grizzly Bear-- folks who consider musicological context. So a shivering dirge like ""Jet Plane"" or the spacey ether-float of ""A Peculiar Hallelujah"" don't seem unduly muted. They're simply well-crafted examples of a certain introspective, highly melodic pop tradition. Although YCHWYW doesn't offer a song as memorable as Can't Go Back's superb ""John Brown"", the tracklist's reasonably solid. First single ""Future Primitive"" is cool and minimal, pitting pulsed bass, throbbing toms, and biscuit-crisp snare hits and tambourines against Quaver's high, hazy croon. In the few moments before his voice enters the analog mix, you could almost imagine a smart-suited Smokey Robinson stepping up to the mic. Hypotensive organ droning opener ""Once We Walked in the Sunlight"" and a few other stretches drag, but punchier tracks like ""A Dictator's Lament"", with its infectious Paisley Underground chorus, and ""The Void"", which flips its slow-creeping intro for a psychedelic, honey-harmonied outro, redeem the record's narcoleptic drifts. But then, warm bath and afternoon nap pop (or, as the ""Future Primitive"" video intimates, tunes for lone, swaddled journeys across post-apocalyptic landscapes), is what fans have come to expect from-- and love about-- Papercuts. If these songs are low-voltage wires that hum, buzz, whir, purr but rarely jolt, they yield just enough electricity to light the way forward.","Papercuts leader Jason Quever again crafts his aesthetic from the raw materials of Zombies, Velvet Underground, and Galaxie 500.

Black Monk Time / The Early Years (1964-1965),The Monks,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38613d1975652138ae3/1:1/w_160/c3208444.JPG,2009-04-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12905-black-monk-time-the-early-years-1964-1965/,PolydorLight in the AtticPolydorLight in the Attic,"Alright, my name's Gary
Let's go, it's beat time, it's hop time, it's monk time! On paper, it's hard to imagine a couplet that looks less like an opener for one of the best albums of the 1960s. When you hear it barked out by Monks lead vocalist Gary Burger over an otherworldly groove, though, it's an unlikely call to arms, and an immediate auditory stamp for one of the most strikingly original bands of the mid-60s. The band's sole studio album, released only in Germany in March 1966, has since become something of a legend, hailed as a precursor to punk and krautrock, and exerting influence far beyond its modest initial sales. Obscurities that routinely bathe in glowing praise naturally engender skepticism among people who haven't yet heard them, and often that skepticism is healthy. In the case of the Monks, though, all the praise is true: in 1966, Black Monk Time was beyond the cutting edge, and today it's easy to hear what made it so innovative and challenging. The Monks were five Americans living in West Germany. They came there as G.I.s, stationed near Heidelberg in the southwestern Baden-Württemberg region, and the Monks began life inauspiciously as the 5 Torquays, a run-of-the-mill beat group that covered Chuck Berry and the latest English groups, drawing good local crowds. When their time in the Army was up, they stayed, but beneath the conventional exterior of the Torquays lay a group hungry to experiment and break the mold of beat music. They accidentally discovered guitar feedback during a rehearsal, and made it a part of their sound, to the dismay of club owners and some patrons. Their apparent willingness to experiment brought them to the attention of two German ad executives, Walther Niemann and Karl Remy, who the band took on as managers, and who would fundamentally reshape the band's image and sound. You know we don't like the Army
What army?
Who cares what army?
Why do you kill all those kids over there in Vietnam?
Mad Viet Cong!
My brother died in Vietnam
James Bond, who was he?
Stop it, stop it, I don't like it!
It's too loud for my ears! It's this sequence of lines from ""Monk Time"" that drives home just what a different game Black Monk Time is. After his call to arms, Burger's demented vocal runs through a whithering critique of war, sealing it with a curt dismissal of James Bond, who at the time was the biggest movie hero in the world. It not only decries violence, but the glorification and fetishization of violence, and Larry Clark's brutal organ interjection is waved off with a couplet that swiftly co-opts critics of the band's new, chaotic sound. One of the things that makes ""Monk Time"" one of the all-time great album openers is how completely it distills the band and its music. The stomping, repetitive bass and drum groove, the splatter of fuzz guitar, the six-string electric banjo hammering out percussive chords, the flailing vocals and loud organ outbursts exemplify the band's confrontational, rhythm-based sound. This is not flower power-- it's rage inspired by senselessness and tempered with humor. Perhaps paradoxically, what makes the Monks' attack on war and the military so effective is the military discipline they applied to the band. On stage and off, they wore monks' robes with noose neck ties and cut their hair in the traditional monks' tonsure, and their music has a rare precision for something so wild. The group shouts of ""Shut up! Don't cry!"" on ""Shut Up"" are in lock-step, and they nail the complex, interlocking rhythm of ""Complication."" All the members sang, and the backing vocals alternately back Burger with drawn-out chants and sudden, shouted responses. ""Higgle-Dy Piggle-Dy"" combines a children's rhyme with a savage rhythmic attack. As doggedly out-there as they could be, the Monks did possess some pop sense-- this music, unique and strange as it is, is entirely approachable, and the band's final recordings, made after Polygram panicked and told them to produce more commercial material, are deranged pop songs that the band genuinely seems to have fun with. ""I Can't Get Over You"" is like a cartoon version of pop music, with weird falsetto harmonies and a big, rubbery bassline, while ""He Went Down to the Sea"" has a tribal Beach Boys quality, with its hard drumming, harmonies and glockenspiel. These and a few others are added to Light in the Attic's reissue of the album, as they were to Infinite Zero's long out-of-print 1994 reissue. On the other side of the band's brief career, The Early Years is a collection of the band's early demos, made as they felt their way toward the sound of Black Monk Time, along with a 45 made in 1964 when they were still the Torquays. It has a different running order, but contains the same tracks as Omplatten's out-of-print Five Upstart Americans compilation from 1999. LiTA's two reissues are meant to function as a combined package, and Kevin ""Sipreano"" Howes' detailed liner notes are written as one piece, split across both discs. The material heard here is good, though anyone new to the Monks should probably make sure they love Black Monk Time before picking it up, the same way you would with any band's demos. One of the interesting things about the demos is how clearly the band's vision had already crystalized-- the recording is structured something like a musical mass, with little churchy organ interludes from Larry Clark and a bit of banter from Burger. For a fan, to hear them honing their rhythmic attack is gratifying-- their sound was no accident. The Monks' music sounds so inevitable on Black Monk Time that it's easy to forget how unlikely the band's story is. For these five guys to find each other in the Army and subsequently devote themselves so fully to such a unique sound, and for two advertising executives to find them and push them to get weirder-- well, there's a reason that even with every incredible change in popular music during the 60s, there's only one Monks. Their one album was revolutionary, but sparked no revolution, due to circumstances beyond the band's control. They wandered back home and got real jobs, played in other bands, and Burger even became mayor of Turtle River, Minnesota. All these years later, you have a chance to hear what they did together again. Don't miss out.","Light in the Attic keeps up its winning streak, reissuing one of the most underrated albums of the 1960s, as well as rate work from the uncompromising Monks.

Infinity +1,A-Trak,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a0b1335d7bf1698786/1:1/w_160/864b4ba9.jpg,2009-04-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12924-infinity-1/,Thrive,"How much does a good mix need to do? If you stop and think about it, there doesn't seem to be a very complicated agenda behind the best ones: keep the rhythmic momentum consistent, shift the tone or mood at the right moment for emphasis, transition between tracks in a non-disruptive way, and cover enough stylistic ground to avoid tedium without going too far and coming across as a disjointed, genre-hopping traffic jam. It's music designed for moving, and if the people are moving, then technically it works. But there's a difference between going to hear someone DJ at a club and actually investing in a mix CD: in the latter case, there's that extra burden of permanence, of knowing that someone will pull this off their shelf or their hard drive years from now as a snapshot of a moment in sound. Infinity +1 says something in that respect: if you want an hour's worth of what constitutes the midpoint between popular and underground dance music at the end of this decade, call A-Trak. Between his Kanye West cred, his facility with a wide spectrum of club music subgenres, his recent history of quality releases like Dirty South Dance, and his just-out entry into the FabricLive series, he's established himself as a favorite among the shutter-shades generation, and for good reason. He's great at putting familiar styles into interesting contexts, blurring lines between eras, and just plain knowing what tracks sound good next to each other. Infinity +1 is an enjoyable exhibition of those skills, even if it's not particularly outlandish in its celebration of modern (and a little classic) electro and house. The mix isn't without its personality, of course: It opens with Shel Silverstein reading his poem ""Invitation"" (""If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar/ A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer/ If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire""), then segues into John Dahlbäck's chirpy, upbeat ""Sidewalk"" with accompaniment by an astronomy-documentary voiceover relaying the life cycle of a maturing star. Not like this is A-Trak's big grown-up artistic statement, though, even if he does pay respect to his elders via Lifelike's electro-fied remix of Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk's 1986 house classic ""Love Can't Turn Around"" and Alexander Robotnick's 83 Italo cult smash ""Problemes d'Amour"". For the most part, it's a succession of names you might've seen if you keep up with the right labels, or at least the MP3 blog discodust: Holy Ghost! (""Hold On""), DJ Mehdi (""Pocket Piano""), Little Boots (""Stuck on Repeat"", remixed by Fake Blood)-- and, a few times, A-Trak himself, both as remixer (Sébastien Tellier's ""Kilometer""; MSTRKRFT's N.O.R.E.-featuring ""Bounce"") and remixee (DJ Spinna reworking his deathless ""Say Whoa""). Yet as familiar as these tracks might be to scenesters, they're even more familiar to A-Trak-- he knows their ins and outs so deeply he has the exact knowledge of where they most effectively overlap. The beatmatching on Infinity +1 is immaculate, hiding the seams so well that he creates brief pockets of mash-up serendipity: The new-wave dance rock bassline of Midnight Juggernauts' ""Shadows"" dovetails neatly into the stuttering vocal intro to the Boys Noize remix of Gonzales' ""Working Together"", and K.I.M.'s burbling synthpop-meets-Detroit techno throwback ""Party Machini"" gets snuck up on by Laurent Wolf's ""The Crow"" to create a monster tandem bassline. And even though the overall tenor of the mix might be familiar, club-friendly electrohouse, A-Trak shows his range by flavoring it with modern hip-house crossover (""Bounce""; Donnis'B-more-meets-ATL ""Party Works""; new Kid Sister track ""Life on TV"") and concluding it with the pastoral, acoustic guitar-driven Prins Thomas remix of James Yuill's ""This Sweet Love"". There's been better mixes this year-- A-Trak's own Fabriclive.45 amongst them-- but if you want to stick evidence of life in early 2009 into a time capsule for exhuming a decade later, Infinity +1 will put this era in a positive light.","If you want to hear what constitutes the midpoint between popular and underground dance music right now, this immaculately beatmatched mix could tell you.

Dark Days/Light Years,Super Furry Animals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b0c0084474cd0c030b/1:1/w_160/23675de0.jpg,2009-04-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12935-dark-dayslight-years/,Rough Trade,"Once you've communicated what you want to say so many ways, there's always the groove. Not that Super Furry Animals were the ones who needed to get theirs back, exactly. I mean, sure, 2007's Hey Venus! wasn't so much ""speaker blowing""-- lead singer Gruff Rhys' advertisement-- as ""hey, SFA still don't suck yet."" But before that, 2005's Love Kraft was a multi-layered psych-funk-folk-samba epic about love, war, and ""no more romantic comedies."" Since then, the Welsh quintet's offbeat side projects-- such as Rhys's Delorean-themed Neon Neon partnership with Boom Bip, or keyboardist Cian Ciárán's electronic-leaning Acid Casuals-- have kept the Super Furry faithful well-supplied. Dark days? Uhh, have you picked up a newspaper lately? Me neither, which I assume is part of the problem. ""People that go out and murder people don't read The Wall Street Journal,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the other day, on whether the shitty economy added to gun violence. And yet all of a sudden a lot of liberal-arts-damaged hipsters seem to know a hell of a lot about the financial sector. Call it a capital infusion: SFA's ninth album in almost two decades as a band, Dark Days/Light Years, is also their most playful since 2001's Rings Around the World. Full of paradoxes and loving parodies, honeyed psych-pop harmonies and shaggy vamps, it's just the sci-fi groove-rock mindfuck to shake us out of our no-fun times. First, the grooves: SFA assembled Dark Days/Light Years-- nine years in the making, 40 days in the recording-- largely out of riffs and ideas that for one reason or another had gone unused. The results are as free-wheeling and inspired as the group has sounded in years-- Super-er and Furrier. Heavy blooz schoolgirl-ballers from Grand Funk Railroad to Eric Burdon can keep their puds and their guts squeezed tight into their bellbottoms after opener ""Crazy Naked Girls"", a three-part song that reclaims wah wah and a whole lotta lovin'. Groove turns to stomp on Ciárán-fronted ""Mt."", which places Donovan folk mysticism over glam-rock schaffel. Then, when the machines groove, it's motorik. The Super Furries meet the ensuing depression with... more wryness. ""Let us make the best of a difficult situation,"" Rhys intones on first single ""Inaugural Trams"", the album's top stand-alone track. In a utopian universe where it would've been politically feasible for President Obama to announce, upon his inauguration, a plan to reduce emissions (""by 75!"") and restore the economy through a public-transportation moon race, ""Inaugural Trams""-- with Franz Ferdinand's Nick McCarthy rapping some of the only German words I know that aren't ""Kraftwerk"" or ""hefeweizen""-- would be the summer jam. If ""Inaugural Trams"" is ""the definitive krautrock song about railcars,"" as New York magazine's Vulture blog wondered recently, it's only in the way Rings Around the World's ""Juxtaposed With U"" was the definitive Philly soul sexx jam. In other words, it's something else. And it's not alone. Lester Bangs once recommended a young punk band call their album The Monkees' Greatest Hits; the biggest disappointment here is that the Super Furries didn't make ""The Very Best of Neil Diamond"" the title track. The song's ancient licks and sweaty percussion might suggest early 00s R&B, or some kind of Eastern thing, but far from it: The chorus of ""trust but verify"" swipes a favorite Cold War catchphrase of Ronald Reagan. Somewhere before the guitar-gnashing bridge, I guess there's also this narrative about a Neil Diamond tape playing in the aftermath of an apocalypse. (And I'm told you can hear quotes from Vivaldi and Beethoven in Metal Machine Music, too...) Right after ""The Very Best of Neil Diamond"" takes us to ""Sweet Caroline"" and back, ""Helium Hearts"" drops us off in Eden. With perfect hippie-dippie non sequiturs about wedding rings, togetherness, and vegemite, it's probably the closest SFA's latest comes to the swooning, ELO-lite psych-pop of past highlights like 1996's ""Something 4 the Weekend"". Just because a band sticks to the old-fashioned idea of an album as a cohesive piece of work doesn't mean it has to get all stuffy about it: Dark Days/Light Years begins with casual chatter and ends, after the ""Beat It"" meets ""Livin' on a Prayer"" bass lines and burbling vocal nonsense of Ciárán-penned quasi-instrumental ""Pric"", with three minutes of droning electronic tones. (SFA have played this kind of prank before, burying career highlights on hidden tracks or non-album singles.) Guitarist Huw Bunford's ""White Socks/Flip Flops"" makes up in wet synths, blistering guitars, and taut rhythms what it lacks in fashion sense; fuzzed bass-guitar duel ""Inconvenience""-- not an Au Pairs cover-- goes from ""what the fuck?"" to jihad and pirate ships (timely!). Even the least exceptional tracks here, twinned songs ""Where Do You Wanna Go?"" and ""Lliwiau Llachar"", still offer raucous drumming and catchy Welsh-language vocals. Remember when columnists predicted the death of irony after 9/11? Didn't happen, but between the whole everybody-losing-their-jobs thing and having an actual well-meaning grown-up in the White House, deadly seriousness is more of a threat now than ever. At least there's Glenn Beck. In the meantime, Dark Days/Light Years brings some good vibes for everyone ""from middle-aged sophisticates to stone-aged reprobates,"" to borrow a line from the rhythmically restrained, Spoon-like ""Moped Eyes"". It used to be called ""Hot Nuts"".","The restlessly creative Welsh band returns with its finest album since 2001's Rings Around the World.

Old Stories,Nancy Wallace,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2cac0084474cd0c010f/1:1/w_160/e9ba5c4b.jpg,2009-04-17 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12757-old-stories/,Midwich,"A longtime fixture in the British contemporary folk scene, east-Londoner Nancy Wallace originally cut her teeth as a vocalist with the shambolic, fiddle-driven folk collective the Memory Band before turning the musical spotlight on her solo material. Her debut album, Old Stories, follows 2005's Young Hearts EP, which featured elegantly pastoral covers of disco anthems by the likes of Candi Staton, Elton John, and Barry White, and indicated a promising beginning for Wallace's simple acoustic compositions. Combining something borrowed with something new, Old Stories features a handful of traditional songs tucked in between Wallace's original arrangements. Her interpretation of ""The True Lovers Farewell"", a Southern Appalachian folk ballad detailing the distress of a lover separated from the object of her devotion, is sung with a heart-wrenching sorrow that is eventually swept away by a cascade of accordions and the mournful sighs of a Busilacchio chord organ. The Celtic love song ""I Live Not Where I Love"" extends Wallace's reflections on distance and broken dreams over the clear pluck of strings, telling the story with her honeyed yet restrained vocal melodies, which naturally lilt with a slight Cockney warble. It's not all trouble and strife for Wallace, however. ""Many Years"" sparkles with the adventurous glow of a new beginning when she sings, ""I'm going where the wind won't find me, I'm going where the seas lie calm."" And ""The Way You Lie"" is an affectionate ode to a sweetheart that blossoms with the integral modesty that lies at the heart of the whole recording-- from the careful arrangements to her contemplative lyrical content. This deft mesh of old and new songs flows together so that Old Stories manages the impressive feat of sounding simultaneously timeless and modern. Wallace's skilful compositions flourish under her spare treatment, so that when she does choose to embellish particular patches, such as the addition of a violin solo in the middle of the traditional English folk song ""The Drowned Lover"" or the chromatic meandering of a concertina on ""Sleeping Sickness"", the result is suitably effective. It's proof that subtlety can be more dramatic than bravado, and testament to Wallace's knack for applying just the right amount of instrumentation to accompany her vivid tales of lovers walking to work through snowy woods or kicking stones around on a beach. That said, the songs on Old Stories have a tendency to sound a bit repetitive, despite being undeniably charming when listened to individually. Wallace's voice never really veers from the path she has set for it, her lyrics are unfailingly grounded in the theme of love and loss, and although instruments fashioned from bellows and buttons match her music well, on a nine-track album with few other dominant sounds, it can get a little irksome at times. However, these are minor issues compared to Wallace's substantial songwriting talent, which takes British folk traditions and reworks them into something just as authentic and beautiful.","Member of English folk collective the Memory Band makes her full-length solo debut, a mix of original and traditional songs set to spare arrangements.

Agorapocalypse,Agoraphobic Nosebleed,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3af5e6ef959693206d0/1:1/w_160/d65b3615.jpg,2009-04-17 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12933-agorapocalypse/,Relapse,"Agoraphobic Nosebleed were one of the few metal bands that actually were extreme. Their 1998 debut, Honky Reduction, helped inspire the ""drum machine grind"" subgenre. With minute-long bouts of smashing everything into nothing, grindcore was already absurd. Replacing human drummers with machines added an extra layer of absurdity. Now bands could crank speeds up to inhuman levels. As plastic percussion flailed away below thrash and death metal riffs, the various vocalists of Agoraphobic Nosebleed extolled drugs, guns, and fucking. It was the sound of civilization's decline, sold at Toys ""R"" Us with hazardous metal parts. This aesthetic culminated in 2003's Altered States of America, which crammed 100 songs into 20 minutes. It was not an album so much as a temper tantrum. Songs ended just as they started. Drum machines came to life, administered brutal tattooings, and went to sleep, all in the space of seconds. The multiplicity of tracks challenged notions of what constituted a song. In its own cheap way, Agoraphobic Nosebleed shredded time into shards. Artists as diverse as Merzbow, Justin Broadrick, and Delta 9 picked up these pieces and reconfigured them on two remix efforts, ANbRX and ANbRX II. Agoraphobic Nosebleed the idea had become as important as Agoraphobic Nosebleed the band. Agorapocalypse is disappointingly listenable. Song lengths are up, exceeding two and three minutes, and the songwriting has diversified. Instead of simply beating listeners into a pulp, songs now speed up, slow down, and breathe. Katherine Katz, of doom metallers Salome, adds refreshingly aggressive female vocals. Male yellers Jay Randall and Richard Johnson still laud the usual taboos, with lurid artwork to match, but the setting feels much more mature. Scott Hull's drum programming now resembles human playing. The album opens with a faux live show lead-in; digital wooden drumsticks count in passages; ""Question of Integrity"" features an impressively realistic drum solo. Hull's guitar playing has also become more conventional, with extended (for grindcore, anyway) leads that don't get much airtime in his other gig, Pig Destroyer. Maturity and humanity don't befit grindcore. The genre is about pushing limits and pursuing the perverse. Now, instead of an overheated drum machine, the beats could be played by a human (albeit an insanely athletic one). Even with fairly developed songwriting, as is the case here, one truth remains immutable: grindcore drags after about a minute. This record should be a jackhammer beatdown, but it merely feels like a very competent metal demo. Ten years ago, this record might have blown minds. But Agoraphobic Nosebleed has become a victim of its own innovation. Having pushed the envelope so far, it now sounds normal. In grindcore, that's a failure.","Agoraphobic Nosebleed are one of the few metal bands that actually were extreme; here, however, they deliver listenable songs at rather normal lengths.

Dusk,Ladyfinger (ne),by: Adrienne Day,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f4c0084474cd0c0177/1:1/w_160/10acc633.jpeg,2009-04-17 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12790-dusk/,Saddle Creek,"Whether it be a quirk of fate or a case of wrong thrice over (wrong place/ wrong time/ wrong sound), Ladyfinger (ne), a post-hardcore four-piece from Emoha, and the hardest rockin' gents on Conor Oberst's Saddle Creek label, have been largely passed over by rock critics and fans alike. Maybe it's that Saddle Creek devotees expect a band called Ladyfinger (ne)-- the (ne) not (thank god) a coy reference to Barthes but to Nebraska-- to have more in common with their navelgazing labelmates. That's not to say that Ladyfinger (ne)-- comprised of singer/guitarist Chris Machmuller (formerly of Bleeders for Treats), ex-Faint bassist Ethan Jones, guitarist Jamie Massey, and drummer Pat Oakes -- aren't searching deep within their hearts and souls for inspiration, but all that rock'n'roll bluster obscures much of the whining. But it is this place, where the power chords meet the emotions bubbling up within, that the marriage of lust and anger starts to break down. It may've worked a charm for Rites of Spring, but in 2009, an over-therapized, coddled youth have a myriad other outlets (hellooooo, internets!) to channel their emotions. Dusk, the quartet's sophomore release, was produced by Minus the Bear's Matt Bayles, the force behind Mastodon's bruising, excellent 2006 album, Blood Mountain. It's a stronger, take-chancier album than Heavy Hands, Ladyfinger (ne)'s somewhat muddy and monotonous debut. Bayles' influence is striking, especially as Dusk kicks off with the promising ""Over & Over"", which shuffles crisp rhythm guitars and a subtle, melodic bassline, before shifting to a somewhat more metal-typical jagged three-chord riff structure and Machmuller's prepossessing howl. Machmuller's got pipes like Cursive's Tim Kasher, and there are enough musical similarities between the two bands to make a tour-pairing work (Ladyfinger (ne) have opened for Cursive on multiple dates), though Ladyfinger's dogged four-square beat structures are snoozy compared with Cursive's elegant math-y parabolas. Now if only Ladyfinger (ne) would take some chances (add some strings! Or a flute! Write a concept album!). As it is, you can easily trace their antecedents: a healthy dose of Fugazi, a dollop of Foo Fighters, stubbly dischordance swiped from early 1990s Chicago bands like Wreck and the Jesus Lizard -- but without their snarl or wackadoodle fury. (Or, we can only imagine, glimpses of forbidden fruit, AKA Lizard frontman David Yow's legendary performance-art set piece, ""The Hairy Tangerine"".) Ladyfinger (ne) really want to rock with their balls out, but sentiment keeps blocking their baser instincts. ""Little Things"" is the standout track here, precisely because it stands out. Move over Motörhead, hello...Hawkwind? Replete with falsetto call-and-response woo-woos, ""Little Things"" is all power and momentum and baldface 70s classic-rock glory, and when the chorus breaks -- ""If you don't intend to really let me go, honey, then pull the trigger baby free my soul..."" you really want ""honey"" to get a grip. As opposed to ""Plums"", where some other Jane has taken her hopes and dreams and ""...cooked them up with the cocaine, and put them into [her] veins there, and now they lie with [her] remains. And that's where they'll stay..."" Which might be a lot more riveting if it didn't clash with an annoying, jangle-y backbeat. Ladyfinger (ne) are obviously a talented bunch, but they're trying to crack open the rock'n'roll firmament with ball-peen hammers, chiseling grooves without making any real breakthroughs. Which is fine in therapy, but not if you're rocking with your cock out. So to speak.","Post-hardcore four-piece from Omaha works with Mastodon producer Matt Bayles to construct a sonically punishing version of the soul-baring Saddle Creek sound.

Let's Stay Together / I'm Still In Love With You / Greatest Hits,Al Green,by: Douglas Wolk,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a45e6ef959693206bb/1:1/w_160/07e95a45.jpg,2009-04-17 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12927-lets-stay-together-im-still-in-love-with-you-greatest-hits/,Fat PossumHiFat PossumHi,"The catalogue of Hi Records-- the magnificent Memphis label that cranked out hits from the 1950s to the 70s-- has been in and out of print for the last few decades, and now it's been licensed by Fat Possum. The first fruits of the unlikely deal are reissues of three of Hi's crown jewels: Al Green's fourth and fifth albums, and the magnificent greatest-hits collection that followed them a few years later. Other soul singers may have had more raw power or a wider stylistic range (although not many of them), but nobody else had Green's virtuosity or interpretive gifts. He could articulate unbelievably delicate shades of feeling with his voice alone; he had an astonishing sense of timing, of pitch, of emphasis, of drama. And, while virtually every other soul marquee name of the era was recording with session dudes, he had a real band worthy of his gifts: guitarist Teenie Hodges, organist Charles Hodges, bassist Leroy Hodges, drummers Howard Grimes and Al Jackson, backup singers Rhodes, Chalmers and Rhodes, and producer Willie Mitchell, who'd had a string of instrumental hits of his own in the 60s and knew how to shape Green's expansive gifts into compact 210-second packages. (Callow youth may know the Hodges brothers as those dudes who backed up Cat Power circa The Greatest.) The title track of Let's Stay Together is a karaoke standard and an ""American Idol"" joke. Surprise: it got there by being one of the best-sung hits of the 70s. Virtually everyone who's covered it has surrendered to the temptation to oversing it; the genius of Green's performance is that he's murmuring it to the person on the next pillow, not declaiming it for the neighbors to bear witness. Green wasn't yet firing on all cylinders as a songwriter, but even the album's lesser songs get spectacular performances. (As with his entire pre-gospel career, Jesus turns up unexpectedly-- this time in the middle of the otherwise secular groove ""So You're Leaving"".) The album's centerpiece is a six-minute-plus cover of the Bee Gees' ballad ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"", on which his vocal is so light and flexible it seems to be fluttering in the breeze coming off the drums. I'm Still In Love With You recapitulates the successful Let's Stay Together formula, right down to the unlikely six-and-a-half-minute cover-- this time it's Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"". But that album had mostly been ""I don't want to break up"" songs; this one is solidly ""I love you, sweetie"" material, and it's even better. In part, that's because Green had learned to write to his voice's strengths, especially his superhuman falsetto. (""Simply Beautiful"", close-miked and nearly whispered, is a shudder of ecstasy at the mere image of a lover's body.) The band's arrangements are a master class in getting out of the way of the groove-- ""Love and Happiness"" is all headroom and negative space, and the drum break at the top of ""I'm Glad You're Mine"" is as understated as funk gets. The present incarnation of the double-platinum Greatest Hits is not quite the original version-- the track listing shifted a little in '77-- but it's the 10-song sequence a lot of babies got made to: three songs from Still In Love, the title track from Let's Stay Together, and six more impeccable classics from the 1970-73 period. The smartly sequenced track listing proceeds from ""Tired of Being Alone"" to ""Let's Get Married"", and the lyrical range encompasses I-want-you, I-want-you-back, and I've-got-you-and-I'm-happy-about-it songs. If there's such a thing as an underplayed song from it, it's probably ""I Can't Get Next to You"", the 1970 single that saved him from one-hit-wonder-dom. The Temptations had had a #1 hit with it the year before, and Green swoops in and steals the song anyway. He transforms the arrangement to a slow, fretful Southern 6/8 bump-and-grind, and sings every line as a message of total sexual desperation, fading out on a perfect high note at precisely the pitch that disintegrates panty elastic. As with the other reissues, the new Greatest Hits trims off the additional material that's turned up on the last few editions: no bonus tracks, no liner notes or historical context, just the album. Doesn't matter, as long as Fat Possum can get this stuff in print and keep it there.","Fat Possum reissues three records from Al Green's legendary Hi catalogue, two of which now stand as stone classics of 1970s soul.

Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle,Bill Callahan,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3aa13d1975652138b2a/1:1/w_160/4422e0f4.jpg,2009-04-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12929-sometimes-i-wish-we-were-an-eagle/,Drag City,"""I used to be darker/ Then I got lighter/ Then I got dark again."" With these three simple lines from ""Jim Cain"", the opening track of his lovelorn new album, the always-succinct Bill Callahan sums up his tempestuous musical trajectory. For those of you keeping score at home, ""darker"" seems to refer to most of his output as Smog, when his songwriting often succumbed to the weary dread his dead-planet of a voice exudes like gravity. The lightening occurred over the course of A River Ain't Too Much to Love, his final record as Smog, and Woke on a Whaleheart, his first post-Smog effort. On these records, romantic gratitude gradually replaced romantic pessimism. Bill Callahan was happy; at peace. But it wasn't to last. The slumbering beast of love, ""the lion walking down city streets,"" awoke, and it was pissed. He got dark again. ""I started telling the story/ Without knowing the end."" And he's still doing so. Over the past two decades, Callahan's music has chronicled his unique, troubling insights about responsibility, faith, and love. The darkness that falls over Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle does not make it a Smog record-- it is an uncommonly gentle darkness that sounds light at first blush. Smog's malevolence seemed like a sweeping indictment of human nature, but here, Callahan's lyrics feel intensely personal. The record, an evident break-up affair, has such a strong air of private conversation that listening to it feels like eavesdropping; the second-person pronouns sail right past us to strike the target of the absent beloved. The reverent intimacy can become almost uncomfortable, as Callahan proffers up his words in the same way the devout handle rosaries. Like Whaleheart, Eagle is kitted out with the instrumentation-- cellos and violins, French horns, pump organs, electric pianos-- that he embraced post-Smog. On Whaleheart, such embellishments were rangy and shambling; here they're loosely clenched, as if Callahan built the music to hold him together. Eagle addresses a specific-sounding lost love, but more broadly, it does what every Callahan record does: It takes a long hard look at who he is and what he believes at this moment. As a result, it finds him questioning the truths he discovered on Whaleheart, as when, on ""Eid Ma Clack Shaw"", he dreams the perfect song and scribbles it down in the middle of the night, discovering in his notebook the next morning the nonsense words of the song's title. This self-portrait is so complex and subtle that it's tempting to skip discussing the actual music, which speaks so eloquently for itself. Some of the finest, most varied arrangements of Callahan's career are here. Wafting strings and contrapuntal soprano vocals render ""Rococo Zephyr"" as buoyant and lilting as its namesake. On ""Eid Ma Clack Shaw"", silvery electric guitar moves up and down staccato piano. ""My Friend"" and ""All Thoughts are Prey to Some Beast"" are almost like folk-Krautrock, with interlocked motifs billowing out over rigid pulses. Best of all is how the clenched arrangements open out into flowing, tender catharsis, and these are the moments you'll come to anticipate-- wait for the beatific chorus that bears Callahan's dense voice improbably high above the sinuous strains of ""The Wind and the Dove"", or the effervescent strings casting periodic surges of light through ""Jim Cain"". Like the birds he loves so well, Callahan's albums find him alighting momentarily on precarious perches and naming what he sees. By the time we hear the music, he seems to have flown on again. His vantage from Eagle is one of textured ambivalence; his images split and shimmer like double-exposures, immediately releasing an obvious meaning quickly followed by a subtler one that equivocates the first. He's ""still as a river could be,"" and a ""child of linger on."" He used to be ""sort of blind,"" but now he can ""sort of see."" On ""Faith/Void"", he decides that it's time to ""put God away,"" to no longer strive for his ""peace in the light."" Twenty years in, and Bill Callahan appears to be tearing up everything he's believed and starting from scratch, armed with the terrifying wisdom of knowing that one knows nothing, and searching for meaning regardless. He's resigned but heroically presses on. The void looms, but the music keeps it barely at bay.","Bill Callahan's second post-Smog album feels unusually intimate and contains some of the most varied arrangements of his career.

Dance Mother,Telepathe,by: Joe Colly,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a9c0084474cd0c02fc/1:1/w_160/c96f15cc.jpg,2009-04-16 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12928-dance-mother/,IAMSOUND,"Melissa Livaudais and Busy Ganges' stock has been rising for a year or so now. On the strength of singles ""I Can't Stand It"" and ""Chrome's on It"", which display the two distinct sides of their increasingly synth-heavy avant-pop approach, the Brooklyn duo comprising Telepathe has generated a good amount of buzz. Pick up a copy of any self-respecting culture rag and there's likely to be a front-of-book profile featuring the girls looking ultra cool in chunky sunglasses and designer hoodies. It stands to reason that their first proper LP, the David Sitek-produced Dance Mother, could certainly capitalize on such attention. But not everyone's convinced. Ask a friend who's caught Telepathe live and he'll tell you what an aggravating experience it is, that the band's lackadaisical stage performance borders on disinterest not only for their audience but also their own material. And there are questions of musicianship: Ganges and Livaudais share an unschooled, tinny vocal presence and don't appear to be masters of, y'know, instruments and stuff. While those aren't clear reasons to discount a group (good ideas should certainly trump chops), they do raise issues about whether or not Telepathe are skating by on style, geographical allure (Brooklyn, Bushwick, whatever), or musical associations. Bobbling an opportunity to prove the band's merit once and for all, Dance Mother leaves many of these questions unanswered. The album's most obvious problem is that its two best cuts-- the above-mentioned singles-- are those fans are already familiar with. All rapid-fire bass and squiggly synths, ""Chrome's On It"" is an accomplished indie-electro reimagining of the standard hip-hop radio banger, but if you picked up the 2008 EP of the same name chances are you've worn it out already. ""Can't Stand It"", meanwhile, gets a spit-shine courtesy of Sitek here, adding depth and polish to the scratchier version that appeared on Rare Book Room's Living Bridge compilation. No less gorgeous than before, it doesn't quite take the place of a brand-new track of equal quality. Take the repeats out of the equation and you're left with a decidedly mixed bag; just a few of Dance Mother's newbies manage to rival their older siblings' success. The futuristic love-lost ballad ""In Your Line"" is one such standout. Over TV on the Radio member Sitek's arrangement (which brings to mind the lovely, underappreciated ""Family Tree"" from his fulltime band's most recent LP) of tribal hand-drums, swirling guitars, and crashing cymbals, Livaudais and Ganges examine past relationships, realizing they miss their exes (perhaps each other-- the band was once a couple) more than they'd care to admit. ""It never meant that much to me... So where did it go? I think I lost it in my heart,"" they sing in tandem. With its skittering beats and lunar synths, ""Michael"" is another track that sounds great pouring out of your headphones. One can't help but wonder, though, if the credit for a song like this, where the appeal lies mostly in the production, should go to Sitek instead of Telepathe. Since the record was a collaborative affair, it's hard to say for sure. But part of what makes me dubious is the lyrical missteps that appear elsewhere on the album. Head-scratchingly opaque and sometimes just plain bad, the girls' lyrics often do serious damage to a few otherwise decent songs. Sometimes they sound like stoners swapping Lost theories: ""Hand-painted the orchid, because we have a second-rate sun,"" they chant out of nowhere in ""Devil's Trident"". Other times it's like Def Poetry Jam: Bushwick up in here: ""Only givers give a hint of the hunt! Fill it up with a pound of gold!"" they exclaim, spoken-word style in ""Lights Go Down"". Moments like these make Dance Mother an uneven, sometimes puzzling listen. In many ways the record contradicts itself: It features a song I could enjoy for years to come (""Can't Stand It"") and others I'd be fine with never hearing again. Flashes of real beauty and sonic adventurousness split time with stuff that seems outright dumb. So it's hard to say what happens to Telepathe from here besides, surely, a few more glossy photo spreads. Are they a flash-in-the-pan case of style over substance or electro-indie savants working towards finding their footing on a mind-blowing sophomore LP? I certainly hope it's the latter, but this album offers no real clues in either direction, so I honestly couldn't tell you.","After two well-received singles and a year of constant buzz, this Brooklyn duo finally issues its Dave Sitek-produced debut.

Dos,Wooden Shjips,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39613d1975652138b04/1:1/w_160/8280c92f.jpg,2009-04-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12914-dos/,Holy Mountain,"If potential were a physical substance, it would've dripped like melted wax from Wooden Shjips' 2006 debut 10"". The three-song slab of raw, noisy grooves was so bursting with ideas, it suggested a lifetime of musical possibilities. Follow-up singles took steps toward that promise, but the San Francisco quartet's first, self-titled full-length was a bit of a retreat. Vital elements-- repetitive bass, wiry guitars, droning keyboards, and ghostly vocals-- remained intact, but there was a weariness to it all, the primitive thrill of previous releases replaced by workman-like resignation. Dos goes a long way towards re-igniting Wooden Shjips' fire. Sonically, its five songs aren't as exploding or abrasive as earlier work-- in fact, this is the smoothest-sounding Shjips record so far. But taut energy courses through most of the album's 38 minutes. Bassist Dusty Jermier sticks to variations on the bouncing line he used to fuel the band's first insta-classic, ""Shrinking Moon For You"". His chugging loops are like a whip-crack, revving the band through their 1960s-licking garage tunes with the momentum of a hurtling 18-wheeler. The twin engines powering that velocity are the Stooges and Suicide. Imagine the machine-like grooves of Fun House simplified even further, with Iggy's yawp replaced by the chilly moan of Alan Vega. (For a more recent reference point, try Yo La Tengo's ""Pass the Hatchet, I Think I'm Goodkind"" recorded in a pool of ice water.) Sure, there are other touchstones here: krautrock, the Doors, Spacemen 3, and pretty much any music reliant on repetition, from Terry Riley to the Fall to Fuck Buttons. But just try listening to Dos' first two tracks-- the mesmerizing ""Motorbike"" and the shimmering ""For So Long"", featuring fuzz spirals from guitarist Ripley Johnson-- without visions of Detroit garage and New York punk coating your eyelids. The rest of Dos can't quite keep the pulse of those initial salvos. Staying inventive within the confines of repetition is sometimes too much for the band to muster. But Johnson's fiery playing is impressive throughout-- on ""Down By the Sea"", his guitar catches so many flames, it's a wonder there's any music left when he's done torching. And Wooden Shjips make up for mid-album sags on the closer, ""Fallin'"". Like Devo's ""Gates of Steel"" filtered through the 1969 live version of the Velvet Underground's ""What Goes On"" (recorded, coincidentally, in San Francisco), it's a 12-minute rock mantra, full of the kind of possibility with which this band began. Dos may not be the Wooden Shjips' masterwork, but by the end of ""Fallin'"", you can once again imagine one in their future.","Drawing on krautrock, Spacemen 3, and pretty much any music reliant on repetition, Wooden Shjips deliver on the promise of their debut EP.

Early Works for Me If It Works For You II,Dntel,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a1ea9e61561daa4d16/1:1/w_160/8eeb9097.jpg,2009-04-16 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12925-early-works-for-me-if-it-works-for-you-ii/,Phthalo,"Before the Postal Service grew from a charming side project into an omnipresent harbinger of indie-rock's growing commercial profile, there was a kid playing bass for a band called Strictly Ballroom while recording techno in his dorm room under the name Dntel. Jimmy Tamborello's solo electronic project wouldn't make much noise until his third record, Life Is Full of Possibilities, released in 2001 when hiring indie singers to vocalize over electronic compositions was a novel idea. Still, it wasn't just the vocal tracks that held Tamborello's breakthrough album together. Early Works For Me If It Works For You II compiles his first two albums on the Phthalo label with some heretofore unreleased material from around the time of his third. Much of the setstands in the long shadow cast by Warp Records' 90s roster, and Tamborello isn't shy about admitting that. But it also contains early experiments with the chilly but affecting instrumentals that filled in the cracks between Tamborello's more infamous collaborations, and it holds up better than you might think. The material goes all the way back to 1994 and up through the early 00s, covering a fertile time for amateur electronic composers. Recorded in 1994, but released by Phthalo in 2001, Something Always Goes Wrong finds Tamborello just beginnging to flex his limbs. The distorted, non-repeating drum work throughout showed a love for Aphex Twin and u-ziq, but is never quite as intricate or sophisticated as either of those producer's work. ""In Which Our Hero Finds a Faithful Sidekick"" rides its breakbeats and yawning bass towards a vague and familiar spy-movie feeling, and while the 8-bit-sounding effects are a lot more conspicuous here than on Dntel's later records, the stretch from ""In Which Our Hero Is Put Under a Spell"" to ""...Frees the Damsel in Distress"" develops the slow and swooning vibe Tamborello explored much more fully in the near future. In contrast to his heroes, Tamborello's style was more cautious and uncluttered, making the most from his nascent ability. While Something was Dntel's earliest material, Early Works For Me If It Works For You was his first release. From the first track on, Early Works... displayed bolder, faster, and more intricate drum patterns. Tamborello was getting better at emulating his influences, but something else was happening, too-- he often dips his toes into textures he'd later grow more comfortable with, like a hurdy-gurdy-like tone that sounds more like live instrumentation and a brief vocal sample on ""Fort Instructions"". You can also hear much of the melancholy keys and surging, almost soothing white noise that made his breakthrough, Life Is Full of Possibilities, so distinct. ""Casuals"" blends all these elements together equally: A vocal sample is even almost audible over an insistent, repetitious drum pattern and a melancholy melody, but all of it is washed-out and obscured by crackling distortion. It felt a little more slippery in terms of genre, but it also tapped a desolate, yet romantic emotional core. The third disc is the one being touted as Early Works For Me If It Works For You II, even though much of it supplements Life Is Full of Possibilities, and would make more sense alongside that record.With titles like ""New Name"" and ""Incomplete 1"" (or its three counterparts), you can tell some of these are sketches, but they already feel like there's a more developed artist is behind them as they quickly establish a mood and tone. There's more R&B influence between the coughs and hiccups of percussion in ""Incomplete 4"" or ""Mini"", and there's more live instrumentation, like the acoustic guitar that takes the foreground on ""Paul Guitar"". Were Dntel's third album ever to receive the typically lavish and usually necessary reissue treatment so many albums do these days, this material would have made for a worthy bonus disc, showing peeks at his process, featuring castaways worth revisiting, and offering hints towards his future. It's worth noting that Early Works for Me II is a pretty lavish physical package in its own right, and remains plenty memorable for having little to no vocal guests.Tamborello's pretty clearly indebted to the standard bearers of IDM, but along the way he made sense of his past and his current passions to come up with something that is, if not totally unique, distinctly his own. This compilation can be uneven, and the journey is maybe more interesting than it is enjoyable at times. But Early Works for Me II is assembled to be a journey, from end to end, and it plays like one.","Jimmy Tamborello compiles his pre-Postal Service work as Dntel, adding previously unreleased material recorded circa Life Is Full of Possibilities.

I Heard It Today,Mr. Lif,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3abea9e61561daa4d2c/1:1/w_160/9547d759.jpg,2009-04-16 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12930-i-heard-it-today/,Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises,"If Kanye West came into the game as ""the first with a Benz and a backpack,"" then Mr. Lif was surely ""the first with dreadlocks and Harry Potter glasses."" The thoughtful, earnest, and unapologetically cerebral Bostonian might be a prototypical ""rapper that liberal arts kids like,"" but he's also ferociously on-point and prodigiously skilled. His last full-length, Mo'Mega, winningly mixed warnings about government conspiracies and mind control with disarming odes to his unborn children and truly unexpected feminine-hygiene advice. On new album I Heard It Today, he takes this autobiographical tack a step further, fashioning each song as a sort of unfiltered blog-entry reaction to the news as it happens. He wrote, recorded, and released to blogs the songs on the record over the course of fall 2008, as the economy plummeted, election fever set in, and Barack Obama won the Presidency. Lif's intentions-- to heat up his politics with personal immediacy-- are admirable, but the result, unfortunately, recreates a bit too successfully how it might feel to read a Mr. Lif Huffington Post column. The successes and failures divide pretty evenly into songs that benefit from the sense they were spilled out in one long breath and ones that feel like they were written on a napkin minutes before recording. ""Welcome to the World"" and ""What About Us?"" were penned, as Lif tells us in the liner notes, as responses to the collapse of the world economy and the bailout plan, respectively, and they are sincerely aggrieved, gut-level blasts that benefit from the surging beats (by some dude named, no joke, Batsauce) that nicely recreate the sort of muscular apocalypse-rap Lif was rhyming over on the Emergency Rations EP. Other songs fall prey to the Cornel West rap-album-as-seminar problem, where Lif get so worked up he sort of forgets he's supposed to be rapping: ""It hurts that even our most prestigious leaders cannot shun what these centuries of hatred have done"" or ""They were willing to give people with bad credit loans because they knew within a few years, we're out of our homes and they can buy up all the same properties"" might be salient points, but they don't exactly make for natural-sounding lines. Which brings us to the other problem: Lif's always had passion and verbal dexterity to burn, but his lyrics typically don't offer much that you can't gather from your first Propagandhi album or an Alan Moore graphic novel. It doesn't help that he still insists on saying things like ""We should use our mind power to collapse the walls."" He also remains touchingly convinced that his decision to wear dreadlocks is controversial in any way, shape, or form: ""While I'm walking down the street, I see it all the time/ People looking at me like my dreads are a crime/ They signify the fact that I refuse to conform/ And I rock 'em real thick, cuz I'm allergic to the norm."" His most thoughtful moment on I Heard It Today comes on ""Head High"", where his indignation cools a bit and and he gets reflective: ""It hurts me to the marrow when I drive through the ghetto/ And see my peoples caught up in a life that won't let go/ And what's weird is/Few of them will hear this/ Melody I'm pouring from my heart so fearless."" It's moments like these that make Lif so appealing: he might be touring the Seven Sisters college circuit for the rest of his career, but he embraces his turf wholeheartedly and raps with palpable zeal and conviction. Unfortunately, the ratio of thoughtful zeal to clunky screed this time around is decidedly not in his favor.","This thoughtful, earnest, cerebral MC might be a prototypical ""rapper liberal arts kids like,"" but he's also ferociously on-point and prodigiously skilled.

Pablo Honey: Collector's Edition / The Bends: Collector's Edition / OK Computer: Collector's Edition,Radiohead,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b313d1975652138b45/1:1/w_160/060b305f.jpg,2009-04-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/,Capitol,"When Capitol released a few different shortcuts through Radiohead's career late last year, we were indifferent to its cause, citing a lack of need and poor selection. Most fervent Radiohead fans would have wasted their money buying these packages, and most people interested in the band would be best served by their actual albums. Well, Capitol has now begun to roll out those parent albums-- starting with the group's three 1990s releases (Pablo Honey, The Bends, OK Computer)-- again, without the band's participation. This time, however, the label is doing it right, dressing the releases up with the right accoutrements: B-sides from the era (and since the era overlapped with two-part CD singles, there are plenty), radio sessions, and music videos. For an epochal, era-defining band, Radiohead had an unusual beginning, looking like they'd wind up one-hit wonders, chancers callously attaching themselves to a sound and moment yet with few ideas of their own. That first hit, ""Creep"", with its loud/soft dynamic and self-loathing lyric, fit snugly into the post-Nirvana alt-rock landscape-- no surprise: Radiohead copped as much from 80s indie rock as their Pac NW brethren did. Yet instead of being hamstrung by platinum success, Radiohead abandoned careerist moves for artistic ambitions, moving quickly to incorporate the record-collector's music of post-rock and Mo Wax, the post-dance, spiritually nurturing end of UK rock, and the pre-millennial tension of IDM and trip-hop. By the end of the 90s, Radiohead hadn't supplanted U2, R.E.M., Oasis, and Metallica as the world's biggest rock band. But it was largely agreed upon that they were the world's best-- and with hindsight, arguably, along with the White Stripes, the last indie-friendly group to conquer the world and punch in the same weight class as early 90s alt-rock giants like Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam, Green Day, or Red Hot Chili Peppers. That they used this critical and commercial currency to such dazzling effect on Kid A and Amnesiac is still one of the highlights of this decade; that the press, especially in the UK, chose the more familiar and necrophiliac ""new rock revolution"" over the relatively pioneering Radiohead is one of the decade's lows. UK rock, for all its heady artistry and visionaries throughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s, had been slumming it a bit when Radiohead first emerged. Size and grandeur, which would become the goals for too many UK guitar bands by the end of the Britpop era, were largely missing from that country's indie scene when Radiohead started recording in 1992. Sure, the Stone Roses had trumpeted their own greatness a few years earlier, but most of the era's indie music was introspective, bands content to gaze at their shoes rather than aim for the back of the venue. Radiohead's early, full-bodied music was, in most circles then, dismissed as empty Americanisms-- and not without reason. The expansive Pablo Honey set-- the 12-song album accompanied by 22 extras-- mostly highlights a group in hock to U.S. indie heroes Pixes and Dinosaur Jr. (with the occasional R.E.M. homage tossed in-- see: ""Lurgee""). The loose ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" and delicate ""Thinking About You"" thankfully break up the 120-minute mood, but most of the rest of the album is squarely in the post-grunge wheelhouse. That's not always a bad thing: ""Stop Whispering"", opener ""You"", and a re-recorded version of early single ""Prove Yourself"" hold up well-- and ""Creep"" has oddly gotten better with age. Elsewhere, the dreadful ""Pop Is Dead"", and songs like ""How Do You?"", ""I Can't"", ""Ripcord"", and ""Vegetable"" are run of the mill at best. If Pablo Honey didn't betray hints of the band Radiohead would become, neither did its B-sides. Unlike contemporaries such as Blur, who used their non-album material to explore new ideas or moods, Radiohead's Pablo Honey-era work is primarily lesser versions of the album. The extra material kicks off with their debut release, the Drill EP, which features three rudimentary versions of LP tracks, plus ""Stupid Car"", the first of Thom Yorke's odd automobile-themed fixations (still to come: ""Killer Cars"", ""Airbag"", the ""Karma Police"" video...) From there, it's a mishmash of alternate takes and also-rans (highlight: the U.S. single version of ""Stop Whispering""), with only the shoegazey ""Coke Babies"" and an acoustic version of early political commentary ""Banana Co."" (released in much better form on The Bends package) worth exploring more than a few times. I distinctly remember then the first time someone suggested The Bends was a great record. Not being one of the million-plus Pablo Honey owners at the time, I was content to hear ""Creep"" on the radio over and over and expected I'd soon spend about as much about time with Radiohead's catalog as one would with, say, Hum or Ned's Atomic Dustbin or School of Fish. The My Iron Lung EP had beaten The Bends to U.S. record shelves by a few months, and the ""High and Dry"" / ""Planet Telex"" single was out a few weeks prior as well, but few noticed. Anyone who had explored those two earlier singles, however, would have been excited for the LP. A reaction to the success of ""Creep"", ""My Iron Lung"" found Radiohead still exploring the loud/soft dynamic, but guitarist Jonny Greenwood was also locating his own identity and Yorke, inspired by Jeff Buckley, was using a wider vocal range, including some falsetto. Balancing a slightly artier sense of musical self-destruction with a sinewy guitar line, on ""Lung"" Radiohead found new ways to pick apart and re-construct the typical alt-rock template. Elsewhere on the EP, the five B-sides demonstrated a band whose collective heads seemed to crack open and spill out new ideas, moving the group away from the dour dead-end of grunge signifiers: With more loose-limbed and nimble guitar work (""The Trickster""), hints of art-rock (""Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong""), the valuing of texture over riffs (""Permanent Daygliht""), offers of emotional nourishment (""Lozenge of Love"" and ""You Never Wash Up After Yourself"") and tension and apprehension about workaday life (""Lewis [Mistreated]""), and themes of misanthropy (um, most of the five songs), these tracks pointed the way toward what was to come. The band's next release, the ""High and Dry"" / ""Planet Telex"" single, announced that they'd arrived. ""Planet Telex"", an early exploration with loops and studio enhancements for the group, is their first song that could have fit on any of their albums, regardless of how experimental they grew; ""High and Dry"", meanwhile, is the blueprint for the big-hearted balladry that spawned the careers of imitators Travis, Starsailor, Elbow, and Coldplay (who, let's face it, wound up perfecting this sort of huggable, swelling arena rock). The Bends was essentially split between these poles: warmth and tension; riffs and texture; rock and post-rock. The tricks employed by ""Planet Telex"" were rarely bested on it-- only arguably by ""Just""-- while the ""High & Dry"" version of the band was topped at every turn here, especially on ""Street Spirit (Fade Out"") and ""Fake Plastic Trees"". Even B-sides such ""Bishop's Robes"" and ""Talk Show Host"" come close to matching ""High"". To many fans, this more approachable and loveable version of the band is its peak. I can't agree, but the record is still a marvel. It feels, with hindsight, like a welcome retreat from the incessant back-patting and 60s worship of prime-period Britpop and a blueprint for the more feminine, emotionally engaging music that would emerge in the UK a few years later-- led by OK Computer. Alongside late 1996 or 1997 releases by Verve, Spiritualized, Belle and Sebastian, Cornershop, Mogwai, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Primal Scream, Super Furry Animals, the Beta Band, Mansun, and even Britpop stars Blur, Radiohead's OK Computer led the push back against knuckle-dragging Oasis clones who segregated their Boomer rock leanings from the fertile explorations of dance, classic indie, hip-hop, and art-school sensibilities going on throughout the rest of the UK. But once again, the press chose what they knew over the new, and despite the plaudits for 2000's Kid A, by the time of 2001's Amnesiac, people wanted another The Bends. OK Computer was the balance everyone agreed upon though-- real songs and tunes, but ones that didn't shrink from the increasingly unlimited possibilities of modern music-making. In that sense, Radiohead were not only record-collectors but futurists, approaching the 21st century from the perspective of their day rather than from the generation prior, as Stereolab, Broadcast, Tortoise, and others were doing (to wonderful effect, granted). Discounting the breather ""Fitter Happier"", only ""Electrioneering"" seems like a misstep on the album today, with the white-knuckle ""Climbing Up the Walls"" and pre-album teaser ""Lucky"" now standing firmly alongside more entrenched highlights ""Paranoid Android"", ""No Surprises"", ""Karma Police"", and ""Let Down"". The record's B-sides are no less rewarding, especially ""Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2)"" and ""Melatonin"", which would have fit fine on LP itself. ""Palo Alto"" proves they could do light and tongue-in-cheek, while ""Meeting in the Aisle"" makes you wonder why they don't record more instrumentals. The group's eventual fascination with, for a successful 90s guitar band, relatively foreign sounds like IDM and 20th century classical music found root around this time and it's on these extras where they first explored these notions. Maybe you don't need to buy these again, maybe you own the material already. If you do, sure-- pass. If you have the LPs but stopped there, both The Bends and OK Computer are worth getting in these versions. If you're curious or a completist, Pablo Honey is out there, too. That the band had nothing to do with these is beside the point: This is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era. That all of those discs are coming out at the same time, rather than being slowly and ceremoniously rolled out as they were 20-odd years ago, is a tacit acknowledgment by the music industry that they best sell non-vinyl physical products now, immediately, before the prospect of doing so is gone. With that in mind, I find it wise that many bands are wisely re-organizing their pasts, or having it done for them by their label. So long as it's done like this, I'm happy to re-purchase the stuff.","Radiohead's first three albums are given expanded 2xCD reissues.

When Sweet Sleep Returned,The Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3835e6ef95969320676/1:1/w_160/48408052.jpg,2009-04-15 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12903-when-sweet-sleep-returned/,Tee Pee,"A couple of months ago I was schlepping around YouTube looking for clips of bands I liked, and in the process I idly looked up San Francisco psych revivalists Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound. And I noticed something interesting: Whether it was due to the sound setup at the band's venue or some limitations of the video or cell phone camera filming their show, many of them sounded almost violently distorted and loud. Even the ones that weren't still seemed like bracing experiences, body-tossing waves of lead-footed riffs and drumming that could dislodge rivets. Considering the forceful if limber heaviness of their previous two albums, their self-titled 2005 debut and 2007's Ekranoplan, that shouldn't be a big surprise. A noisy space-rock band? You don't say. But When Sweet Sleep Returned might be the album that changes that whole dynamic. Despite their stoner-rock bonafides, Assemble Head have frequently found themselves on the edge of mellow, and this new album-- while still fairly powerful with the volume up-- seems to be reining in their more chaotic tendencies, with fewer blown-out serrated edges and more clean, open space. Tim Green, who engineered Ekranoplan (as well as albums by nu-acid rock vanguards Earthless and Comets on Fire), might have something to do with that, though the differences between the albums from a pure production standpoint are subtle-- the most noticeable effect being a somewhat less prominent bass rumble. Yet for a group that immerses itself in much of the late 1960s/early 70s cusp-of-metal sound, Assemble Head never quite went far enough into the abyss of Sabbathoid doom that other stoner bands planted their flags in. You can imagine them cranking up Blue Cheer or Hawkwind every now and then, but they've also owed a fair amount to Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and even early Grateful Dead, more old-school hippie than proto-hesher burnout with each successive album. The lessened emphasis on early metal on When Sweet Sleep Returned is a mixed blessing-- previous records benefited from the caustic sonics Sweet Sleep lacks, but the cleaner, more bucolic sound reveals a band that, comparatively traditional-minded as they are, at least has a good handle on getting past clichés to burrow to the root of what made California psych and post-psychedelic rock work. And that relies on the guitar tones of Charlie Saufley and Jefferson Marshall. Their strength isn't necessarily in fuzzed-out amplification, but in unpredictable versatility; all at once they can sound menacing and pastoral, leaden and ethereal, even if they seem to be cribbing from a wide array of 40 year-old blueprints. ""By the Rippling Green"" is the most immediate standout-- a two-layered melodic theoretical summit of John Fogerty rhythms and some of Neil Young's more low-key moments-- but it's not the most typical one. You might actually have a hard time pinning anything on this album as especially typical of anything else, actually: The riffs in ""Two Stage Rocket"" smoothly transition from 1966 to 69 Pink Floyd, ""The Slumbering Ones"" crossbreeds sprawling desert blues-rock with hints of a mutant strain of shoegaze, and the gentle hippiefied boogie rock of ""Two Birds"" slowly but surely expands and explodes into a solo-drenched peak that re-envisions Spiritualized as a jam band. The funny thing is, even though the guitars are just as prone to twang as they are to growl, and even though the rhythms are often more floaty than heavy, there's no lack of power here. You just have to find it in unexpected places: While there's not a lot of squall and noise, there's still plenty of velocity, and the album thrives on uptempo tracks like the borderline alt-country ""Kolob Canyon"" and the fuzzed-out ""Clive and the Lyre""; the latter song comes closest to showing some actual snarl, and exhibits Assemble Head's affection for fellow Nor Cal psychmongers Comets on Fire. The only real bummer with When Sweet Sleep Returned-- aside from the subjective fault of being ""uninnovative""-- is the lyrical element; when the vocals aren't getting swept away along with the momentum, they're buried a bit low in an otherwise clean mix or distorted just enough to make every third word unclear. That's a shame, since what one can glean of them hints at a fascinating blend of post-apocalyptic dread and blissed-out reverie. But the music doesn't need to hint at that vibe-- it lays it out in Cinemascope panorama, fuzz or no fuzz.","Despite their stoner-rock bonafides, Assemble Head's new album-- while still fairly powerful-- seems to be reining in their more chaotic tendencies.

The Last Kiss,Jadakiss,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a399ea9e61561daa4cff/1:1/w_160/1bd23f50.jpg,2009-04-15 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12917-the-last-kiss/,Def Jam,"Rapping is easy; releasing records is hard. This is the melancholy truth that emerges from Jadakiss' third tepid and unfocused solo record in eight years. As a rapper, Jada's bona fides are firmly in place-- both Eminem and Q-Tip have named him to their top 10 of all time-- but when it comes to releasing albums, his batting average is only slightly higher than Saigon's. If his long, tortuous, and uneventful solo career is any indication, the ability to spit a hot sixteen-- or even hundreds upon hundreds of them– is nothing compared to the grit and determination it takes to face down a roomful of record execs, because The Last Kiss, even more than his previous two records, is exactly the sort of nothing-for-everyone platter that results from too many greedy, insecure hands in the pot. To be fair, Jada is just as likely complicit the anonymous mess that is The Last Kiss as anyone. He's painfully ill-suited for the spotlight, but he can't seem to shake his confused thirst for superstardom and the big royalty checks it is supposed to bring, which is probably part of the reason why The Last Kiss comes equipped with two versions of ""the Pharrell song,"" (""Stress Ya""and ""Rockin With the Best"") the first sounding like a bleepy retread of ""Can I Have It Like That?"" and the second sporting the kind of lounge-R&B cheese Pharrell was peddling to Snoop in 2006 (think ""Let's Get Blown."") It's why DJ Khaled's screaming neon synthesizers strafe across a song called ""Grind Hard"", which is saddled with perhaps the most limp, unmemorable hook Mary J. Blige has ever been paid to sing. And it's the reason he's droning ""Go baby, you're so wavy/ I ain't never felt this way about no lady"" over Eric Hudson's poor-man's-Rodney-Jerkins back beat on ""By My Side"" alongside Ne-Yo. The problem is, and has always been, that Jadakiss just has no commercial instincts; he has only the vaguest idea of what a ""hit""sounds like, and reliably associates ""slick and expensive-sounding"" with ""a sure thing."" Even worse, his bars on the street cuts, his traditional area of strength, have turned slack and rote. ""Guns gon' clap, packs gon' move/blood get drawn, skin gon'bruise/the real gon' win, the fake gon' lose,"" he raps on ""Who's Real"", over a tinny Swizz Beatz beat. And after 10 years or so of not making it big, his boasts are starting to sound oddly deflated: ""I'm one of the best in the world, ma, that's what they say on the blogs"" is apparently what passes for a Jadakiss pick-up line these days. Jada's too talented to produce a completely worthless album, of course, and there are the usual one or two frustrating glimmers of the promise that keep getting him record deals. ""One More Step"" is a reliably satisfying back-and-forth with Styles P; ""Cartel Gathering"" features Ghostface and Raekwon, which is categorically never a bad thing. On ""Death Wish"", the Lil Wayne collaboration that leaked about a month ago, Jadakiss finally narrows his eyes and focuses, and his verse leaves a smoking crater that not even a relatively on-fire Wayne can fill. ""What If?"", meanwhile, coasts along on a nice 80s-R&B sample, even though it is a bald retread of ""Why?"", his only hit and still the best song of his solo career, and even though guest rapper Nas takes the ""provocative question"" formula straight into tinfoil-hat territory: ""What if Hillary and them was reptilian?/ And 2012 was the end of men and all world civilians?"" Yeah-- think about that. The best song by far, though, is ""Things I Been Through"", a bite of Luther Vandross's ""Promise"" that reflects with startling honesty on Jada's endless struggles to maintain a toehold in the rap industry. With genuine affection in his voice, he reminisces about traveling with Puffy on the No Way Out tour: ""Videotaped it all, I still watch it now/traveled around the world, learned how to rock a crowd."" He sums up his career ups and downs with a judgment as poignant as it is succinct: ""It ain't much, but it beats poor."" Maybe he should take this advice and run with it: KOCH might not be Def Jam, and Jadakiss will probably never be the next big thing, but at least that label would let him put out records, and he probably wouldn't even have to include a Ne-Yo collaboration.","Jada's reputation as a rapper is secure-- Eminem and Q-Tip named him to their top 10 of all time-- but he's never been able to put together a truly solid LP.

Jigsaw,Lady Sovereign,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37f9d034d5c69bf2e33/1:1/w_160/0d11ff21.jpg,2009-04-15 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12899-jigsaw/,EMIMidget,"When you consider there are people paid extremely well to know what the public wants, is it fair to blame the public when a major-label marketing plan bricks? I suppose we found out with Lady Sovereign's Public Warning, which was given every chance to succeed-- cosigned by Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, and Def Jam itself and extensively profiled in laudatory but ultimately patronizing puff pieces, Lady Sovereign eventually got to #1 at TRL with the Feminem video for ""Love Me or Hate Me"". A bunch of hard-working street teamers got a totally sweet pizza party for that one. And yet none of this prevented Sov from becoming a questionable signing-- the Jerome James to Jay-Z's Isiah Thomas-- and the blame game began: Listeners caught in the blog-hype cycle abandoned her quickly after Run the Road once Public Warning was found lacking a new single like ""Ch-Ching"" or ""Random"". More nefariously, it was suggested that listeners still weren't willing to accept a white British girl in a milieu that is still predominantly black, American, and male. But then, something funny happened: Lily Allen got really popular. And Santigold. M.I.A., too-- not just in the sub-urban pop realm that Sov was laser-marketed towards, but also among the rap heads her skills were supposed to knock out (if Bun B ever spits flame over ""Love Me or Hate Me"" you know where to find me). What really happened is something that the abominable Jigsaw could not make more blindingly obvious: Since 2006, Lady Sovereign has been pretty much incapable of making music people might actually want to listen to. It's not that Jigsaw doesn't try hard enough-- despite being free of Def Jam's expectations, the stench of desperation is so strong that these don't feel like songs so much as contingency plans. As you might have heard, ""So Human"" is a straight rip of the Cure's ""Close to Me"", but pales compared to sample-source cousins Ce'Cile's ""Rude Bwoy Thug Life"" or Robyn's ""Konichiwa Bitches"". Whatever sense of mental anguish she's looking to convey here gets cancelled out by the piercingly chipper backing track and her laughable rhymes (""runnin' out the studio like Forrest Gump!""). And yet, even if it's Track 2 on Jigsaw, ""So Human"" is only its second-most annoying song to that point: Remember the Streets' ""War of the Sexes""? Trade blow for herb and you've got opener ""Let's Be Mates"". On that note, past comparisons to the Streets' Mike Skinner were borne from cultural cliché, but on Jigsaw the prophecy becomes true-- like Skinner's recent work, instead of woodshedding on the mixtape circuit like smarter and hungrier rappers, we're treated to lightweight albums that are three years in the making and still feel like a rushed jumble of bad ideas that just get worse as they go along. I'll spare quoting from the quite literal breakfast-in-bed dare ""Food Play"" and just say that Paris Hilton didn't make it a hot Carl's Jr. commercial, and Sov doesn't make it a hot song. We've heard a lot about the dark times Sov went through after Public Warning, but other than vague references to how interview junkets are a pain in the ass, Jigsaw quite literally admits how she's left with nothing but ""bullshit"" to say about it. So sadly Jigsaw isn't a confident grasp of a lived-in image: Realizing in 2009 that it's more beneficial to one's chances to spit like Maya instead of Marshall, more traditional hip-hop tracks like ""Bang Bang"" brazenly lift the shanty-town cheerleader cadences of Arular-- ""I've got that bang bang sound/ So won't you crank it loud,"" goes the chorus, an odd request of a record that has roughly zero low end. Similarly, on the Gwen Stefani-scented ""I Got You Dancing"", Sov promises she'll have you ""do it in time to my metaphors."" Jigsaw is a record with roughly zero metaphors. However, you do get a healthy selection of failed similes, the most blatant coming on the title track-- ""I've got you on my mind/ I've got shit on my mind/ I've got plenty of time to just sit and rewind/ And just sip on my wine."" This is why her heart is like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm not willing to hold out the possibility that nationality is causing Sov's career to stall, not when I heard both ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"" and ""Wearin' My Rolex"" at an LA Fitness that rarely plays stuff more leftfield than, say, Bowling For Soup. And I'm not willing to hold out the possibility that as a male critic, I'm unable to relate to the sort of personality she's looking to embody on Jigsaw-- more than ever, there's a vacuum of strong female personalities in hip-hop, and instead of the piss-taking joker we heard years ago that turned Vertically Challenged into a teaser of potential, there's a depressing and shrill neediness that could get Sovereign a bit part in He's Just Not That Into You. The sad part is that might have been Sov's intention all along.","Free of Def Jam's expectations and Feminem marketing angles, Lady Sovereign gamely tries again.

Jewellery,Micachu and the Shapes,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39f13d1975652138b12/1:1/w_160/69e1b7a4.jpg,2009-04-15 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12922-jewellery/,Rough Trade,"The first sound on Micachu and the Shapes' debut album is an acoustic guitar, so what else is new. But what Mica Levi is playing isn't a chord anyone's heard before-- it's a dry, gnashingly dissonant cluster, and she's hammering away at it very intentionally. A few seconds into ""Vulture"", she's joined by the other two members of the band, drummer Marc Pell and keyboardist Raisa Khan, who act as if Levi's actually just playing some kind of giddy surf riff. By the time the song skids to a halt, less than three minutes later, it's made a few hairpin turns into and back out of grime/carousel-music fusion while Levi's been chanting and whooping lyrics about her inedibility in a proud, largely indecipherable LDN accent. On a first listening, it's maddening noise; by the fourth or so, it's as catchy as a jingle. Jewellery is a chaotic record, and an enormous mess. It's also, pretty much, the freshest thing to come along so far in 2009. Levi belongs to the generation that's grown up with the total availability of every kind of music ever, and she wants to play it all at the same time as she's text-messaging, so it's a good thing that pop plus anything equals pop. She's got highbrow compositional bonafides (""influences"" listed on the band's MySpace page: ""harry partch, and all those other guys""); she's got some U.K. hip-hop cred (her mixtape Filthy Friends is even more of a pileup); she's a little bit rock'n'roll (the fuse that ignites the album's best song, ""Calculator"", is the guitar riff from ""Tequila""). ""Sweetheart"" is a high-tech, neon-butterfly take on the hardcore punk two-step. At least one song prominently features a vacuum cleaner. Nothing stays in place for more than a few seconds, but very often her avant-gardist and party-time impulses snap together, as when the scrape-and-tweak that opens ""Lips"" abruptly congeals into a wiry bhangra groove. It's not clear, though, how much the insanely clever arrangements are the band's and how much they're producer Matthew Herbert's. At the center of this cyclone of jujubes and sandpaper is Levi's tart, snaggy voice, which occasionally recalls Lora Logic's dizzy trill but more often ducks down into the mix and clings to no more than a couple of notes. (It's probably perverse to wonder how awesome it would be if the group collaborated with a really good R&B singer.) Levi is one of the most androgynous-sounding woman vocalists I've heard in years-- pitch her down a percent or two and she could pass for Mike Skinner-- but her persona isn't quite post-sex: while most of her rare intelligible lyrics concern the romantic conundrum, they're generally brushing it off metaphorically (""I could eat your heart"", she yodels) or literally (""I won't have sex 'cause of S.T.D.s""). Mostly, though, Jewellery is a vehicle to show off the band's hoard of shiny new sounds-- although they haven't yet figured out how to sort out the gemstones they've got in abundance from their ice chips and broken glass. It's not a record built for staying power, despite the thrilling moments in almost every song. But its failures mostly have to do with idea-overload and short attention span, which are very promising problems to have on one's first album. Levi and her band sound more like the future than the past, at a moment when we desperately need some more future, and as much as I've come to dig this album's awkward, brash cacophony, I want to hear what they do next even more.","London group's debut, produced by Matthew Herbert, is a chaotic mess that also happens to be one of the freshest things to come along so far in 2009.

Kingdom of Rust,Doves,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a385ea9e61561daa4cc6/1:1/w_160/7f66f0d2.jpg,2009-04-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12904-kingdom-of-rust/,Heavenly,"The story of Doves puts lie to the old adage that ""it's all about the music, man."" Because if it really were all about the music, Jez and Andy Williams would be the most famous brothers to come out of Manchester, Jimi Goodwin would be the go-to Britpop duet partner for Jay-Z and Kanye, and all those ""Viva La Vida"" ringtones you hear going off at Urban Outfitters would be replaced by a digitized symphony of Doves' ""Black and White Town"". But as their back-story includes no tabloid-baiting tales of fraternal fisticuffs or marriages to Hollywood starlets, Doves could be the most unassuming, unsung band to have scored back-to-back UK No. 1 album debuts; on North American shores, their ascent has been somewhat hampered by the fact that their opening bands (the Strokes in 2001, the Rapture in 2002) have blown up bigger than the headliner. And unless one of the Doves starts dating Jennifer Aniston anytime soon, it's unlikely that Kingdom of Rust will radically change their stature. Rather, Doves' fourth album is another sterling example of why the Doves should be household names and why they probably won't ever be: their unwavering flair for producing mountainous, Wembley-worthy pop anthems that are nonetheless invested with a palpable degree of grace and humility. While the past decade has seen the indie kids go dance and the dance kids go indie, Doves' 1998 formation was ironically predicated on an abrupt, 180-degree break from their former house-production guise as Sub Sub, absconding rhythmic propulsion for a space-rock sway. But more than any previous Doves album, Kingdom of Rust is built for motion and acceleration, leading its songs to unexpected and often exhilarating highs: Slow-percolating opener ""Jetstream"" counts down to lift-off with a hi-hat-triggered techno bed track that gradually intensifies into a tremorous, tribal clatter; ""The Outsiders"" blasts potholes into the Autobahn with a brawny Krautrock beat. Even when the band seemingly reverts to its familiar astral balladry on ""10:03"",  the reprieve is short-lived-- Goodwin's sweet, moonlit serenade is eventually upended by a creepy chorus of ghostly voices, launching a psych-rock eruption that suddenly transforms the song from Kingdom of Rust's most elegiac moment into its most unsettling one. Perhaps this restlessness is indicative of certain frustration on Doves' part in seeing their efforts eclipsed by less imaginative, more mawkish Britpop bands, and in turn, a desire to distance themselves from the sad-sack pack; it's hard to imagine the likes of Elbow turning in something quite as fierce and paranoid as ""House of Mirrors"", a fuzz-soaked stomper punctuated by jarring, bump-in-the-night sound effects. For a band whose Allmusic.com descriptor list includes the terms ""earnest,"" ""reflective,"" and ""lush,"" Doves are just as effective at being aggressive, to the point where Kingdom of Rust's serene turns feel more listless than usual: the dark, orchestral manoeuvre ""Birds Flew Backwards"" exposes the limitations of Goodwin's haggard voice, while ""Spellbound"" feels like an echo of previous capsized lullabies like ""Sea Song"".. But then some tricks are worth repeating: Doves' most enduring and admirable quality-- from 2000's ""The Cedar Room"" to 2002's ""There Goes the Fear"" to 2005's ""Black and White Town""-- has been their ability to render everyday urbanity in joyful, fantastical form, and to this canon we can add Kingdom of Rust's ""Winter Hill"", a paean to innocent, hand-held romance sent skyward on a pillow of Spiritualized swirls. It's just the sort of song that should earn Doves a return appearance to the UK top 10, but such an accomplishment is ultimately a moot point for these guys: They don't need high chart placements to make them feel like they're on top of the world.","Doves' fourth album is another sterling example of why Doves should be household names and why they probably won't ever be.

Good Evening,Nite Jewel,by: Ian Cohen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36f13d1975652138ab5/1:1/w_160/c3a5ec4a.jpg,2009-04-14 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12888-good-evening/,Human Ear,"How far from an actual disco can dance music get? Chromatics and Junior Boys make a sort of dance music suitable for transit-- steeped in typical club-friendly sonics, their records are the soundtrack to the drive home from the club rather than the night out itself. Taken to its logical extreme, is it possible to make a sort of dance music as a completely disembodied observer? Los Angeles' Ramona Gonzalez, under the name Nite Jewel, seems set on finding the answer. Like the phrase ""Nite Jewel"" itself, Good Evening is minuscule and precious, both of which are charming descriptors, but its fragility is taken to an almost palpable extent. Once the record gets past a certain volume in headphones (it doesn't take much), you can faintly hear recording buzz splitting it apart at the seams. Take ""Suburbia"": Underneath Gonzalez's incorporeal wail, nothing feels concrete, despite the insistent and simple repetition. The leading synth blurt falls in and out of tune while the four-on-the-floor kick drum threatens to go into slack triplets. Any quantizing feature could ""solve"" this problem, but is seeing the stitching part of the appeal? The whole appeal? On ""What Did He Say"", the most immediately striking track on Good Evening, there's a nifty bassline but the moment it modulates up a couple of steps, the mix turns to mush. If you've ever played a preset song on a Casio and switched up between incompatible major scales, you might get the idea. There are positives, but even they raise questions: Bubbling single ""Artificial Intelligence"", which is probably the first track on Good Evening with a discernible lyric (even if it's just the title), has a clear-eyed purpose. Meanwhile, ""Let's Go (The Two of Us Together)"" and ""Chimera"" follow in the path of ""Weak For Me"", an earlier highlight that cops its sound from the Jets' ""Crush on You"". It's debatable whether this DIY take on lite and funky Reagan-era R&B is refreshing or akin to munching on a piece of bubblegum that's been stuck in a pack of Donruss since the mid-80s-- why dull the hooks when the sort of fidelity that could bring them to a focus is more readily available than ever, even to artists at their most entry-level? But then again, maybe it's not a remix Good Evening needs so much as a fair yardstick to measure it by. Though it's arguable that each has different goals, the same sort of disembodied vocals and languorous textures you hear in acts like Grouper, Beach House, and A Sunny Day In Glasgow are proof there's more to this sort of thing than sounding like a Cocteau Twins record playing two parties over. Alas, Nite Jewel isn't at the level of the aforementioned; with her devotion to a sound at the relative cost of songs, she's more like a shuttle-mate of Salem in the blog-hype space race to find an act that can merge tapes-out-of-the-trunk hip-hop recording methods with 4AD gossamer. Now let's see if they're willing to outsource the engineering.","Like Chromatics and Junior Boys, Nite Jewel makes dance music more suitable for the ride home from the club than the actual disco.

Life and Times,Bob Mould,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3959d034d5c69bf2e6a/1:1/w_160/73af201f.jpg,2009-04-14 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12913-life-and-times/,Anti-,"Bob Mould made his name laying his emotions bare, and it's a trait that's not only stayed with him throughout his 30-year career, but one that perhaps has become even more pronounced. The same holds true for alt-legend Mould's level of self-awareness, which, too, has grown more and more pronounced as his influence continues to seep through every level of the indie strata. ""There's sort of a traditional sound I have,"" he admitted to me a year ago. ""It's singer/songwriter playing mostly electric guitar, writing linear songs that are fairly catchy, and fairly emotionally introspective. Anything that goes too far off of that is a challenge for some fans. Then there are the fans that unconditionally listen to what I do. Having said that, one of the things I've been curious about is that there seems to be this other group of people for whom I'm damned if I do anything, that if I'm not doing free jazz, I'm not progressing."" Needless to say, Life and Times, Mould's ninth solo album, does not mark a free jazz transformation, nor does the disc represent much musical progress at all, per se. Maybe that's for the best, since the closest Mould has come to anything close to ""progress,"" as such, is his divisive foray into dance/rock fusion, Modulate. Yet time marches on, and no matter what the songs themselves may sound like, Mould in 2009 is a much different person from the Mould who helped merge hardcore intensity with pop. That's a different sort of progress, but one worth acknowledging all the same, as never before has Mould seemed this comfortable with his status as one of the progenitors of a sound adopted and adapted by everyone from Pixies and the Foo Fighters to the Hold Steady and No Age. While it would be unfair to saddle Mould with the same ol' ""best album since..."" cross, Life and Times does manage to reflect each facet of Mould's career, from his punk roots through his current electronic leanings. In fact, from its melodies to its sheen, the album represent Mould at his most Sugar-y, the disc's easily digestible power-pop fueled by overdriven guitars and break-up regrets yet tempered by Mould's ruminative vocals. Most importantly, Life and Times offers hook after giant hook. Not that Mould seems particularly settled on the opener and title track-- in the song, the conflict isn't just romantic rejection but the more complex challenge of embracing love at the risk of inviting future hurt. Uncertainty similarly simmers beneath the surface of ""The Breach"" or the illustratively titled ballad ""I'm Sorry, Baby, But You Can't Stand in My Light Any More"", but even with the latter, there's an implied light at the end of the tunnel. ""I always find the broken ones/what does this say about me?"" Mould sings, the realization offering the possibility of rehabilitation and, ultimately, reconciliation in the midst of an album scented with love gone sour. You root for Mould to pull through, too. Earlier in his life, Mould often responded to inner conflict by lashing out, but here he instead reaches out, with the inviting jangle of ""City Lights (Days Go By)"" and even on the bitter ""Bad Blood Better"", pulling us closer than ever into his subconscious. The guy still needs a hug, but more than ever before he sounds like a guy open to giving one back in return. Yet accessibility never overshadows Mould's innate qualities. Indeed, dozens of acts could pull off a pop-punk squall like ""Argos"", ""Spiraling Down"", or ""MM 17"", but only Bob Mould sounds like Bob Mould when he contemplates ""the taste of last night's sex in my mouth."" Later, when he peels off a blitzkrieg solo on ""Wasted World"" it's like hearing decades of punk history come washing out of the speakers like a wave. In the past that racket would have pushed you away. The Mould of Life and Times, on the other hand, has arms outstretched. It's a contemplative work setting the stage for Mould's upcoming memoir, whose hooks will for once have to connect without the almost comforting bark of his vocals or buzz of his guitar behind them.","While it's unfair to saddle Bob Mould with the same ol' ""best album since..."" cross, Life and Times does manage to reflect each facet of his career.

Swoon,Silversun Pickups,by: Ian Cohen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a2ea9e61561daa4d18/1:1/w_160/9ff8726d.jpg,2009-04-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12926-swoon/,Dangerbird,"Silversun Pickups generated more Smashing Pumpkins comparisons than any band this side of Zwan with their 2006 debut Carnavas, and whether or not it was justifiable, it was certainly understandable. But in the manner in which these things usually work out, such hyperbolic comparisons helped the Silver Lake band way more than it hurt them-- if they haven't quite reached the national profile of the Pumpkins, when I suggested that Los Angeles lacked a band that was locally connected, critically respected, and popularly accepted, I got a bunch of e-mails claiming my exclusion of Silversun Pickups had to be unintentional. Despite a handful of expected Second Album Upgrades (cue the strings!), Corgan influences continue to manifest themselves on Swoon-- Brian Aubert's treble-gutted riffs, the tendency to honk boyishly miserable lyrics through his nasal passage, and requirement that a bassist must be a looker that can harmonize. But while the Great Pumpkin would balance ""Siva"" and ""Quiet"" with a ""Disarm"" or ""Window Paine"", the Pickups just polish-to-shine loud modern rock songs that feel like they evolved out of jam sessions based on ""Drown"" and go on at least a minute longer than they should. The shortest track on Swoon clocks in at about 4:30 and the longest at 5:55, but these roomy structures don't house stand-alone riffs, mean displays of chops or interesting dynamic diversions. More often, it's tougher to tell when the Pickups should've cut. Though Swoon never becomes unpleasant, Aubert's lyrics and melodies are so wishy-washy that you'd think they were going out of their way to be ignored. Hardly any melodic turns stick among these slippery and repetitive textures-- the Pickups are so mesmeric at times that if they had more groove, they could pass for a Krautrock band. Most of the blame for Swoon's featureless vista goes towards its identikit modern rock production. You wouldn't think these guys would be better off listening to Siamese Dream more, but, you know-- listen to Siamese Dream, particularly ""Soma"" or ""Today"" or ""Geek U.S.A."" and you recognize the dynamics are actually dynamic. Here, the Edge-wise tapping that of ""Getting Old Is Getting Old"" and ""Draining"" register at pretty much the same volume as the martial intensity of album highlight ""Panic Switch"". When the chorus of ""Secrets"" is supposed to blast off, there's no room in its obnoxiously compressed confines. Upon the announcement of Swoon's impending release, Pitchfork's Tom Breihan's backhanded compliment that Carnavas had two really great songs whereas most other albums had none was pretty much on-point-- no matter how you choose to interpret that. Swoon ultimately delivers the exact same results as its predecessor mostly because it's written in nearly the exact same way. The problem all along for the Silversun Pickups isn't that they sound too much like the Smashing Pumpkins. They just sound way too much like themselves.","Silversun Pickups, who generated more Smashing Pumpkins comparisons than any band this side of Zwan with their 2006 debut Carnavas, return for Album #2.

Great Lengths,Martyn,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a368ea9e61561daa4c82/1:1/w_160/6cdd2a30.jpg,2009-04-14 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12883-great-lengths/,3024,"Nearly a decade old, dubstep is entering into its restless adolescence. I can't remember the last time an established genre felt this dynamic, this much in flux. Fans are spoiled for choice, with every week bringing a panoply of new releases and, just as crucially, new names. Artists with whom we've only recently become familiar are maturing at a prodigious rate, while a new crop of labels and artists from outside the genre's London birthplace-- Bristol, Glasgow, Berlin, the Netherlands-- keep coming out of the woodwork. If the scene's mainstream is defined by its ubiquitous, industrial-strength ""wobble,"" the margins are host to mutation after mutation, as the music absorbs and synthesizes elements of soca, funky, IDM, industrial, hip-hop, downtempo, ambient, classic 2-step garage, and, especially, Detroit techno and dub techno. The eagerly hypothesized techno/dubstep crossover is no longer a critic's fantasy: it's a given. Artists from both sides of the divide-- Shed, Scuba, 2562, Ramadanman, Kode9, Ben Klock, Andy Stott, MLZ-- are increasingly meeting in the middle, crafting tracks that blend the tempos, hallmarks and quirks of both genres. The Dutch producer Martyn is one of that lot's most versatile talents, and his debut album, Great Lengths shows an appropriately varied and evidently personal set of interpretations of dubstep's present possibilities. Like many dubstep artists, Martyn came to the genre from drum'n'bass, but he crossed over only comparatively recently. His first records, released in 2005 and 2006 for Marcus Intalex's Revolve:r label, clearly drew from the same spring that a decade before had fed the lush atmospherics of Alex Reece and LTJ Bukem. (It's not all so tranquil; ""Nxt 2 U"", for Play:musik, sounded like a tech-step rework of Konono No. 1, and hinted at a growing interest in unconventional rhythms and textures.) By 2007's ""Broken"" (Revolve:r), Martyn had slowed to dubstep's tempo, but he left many of his usual elements-- drifting pads, rapidfire percussive patterns-- intact. The effect was like watching as the spokes of a moving car's wheels seem to flicker backwards and forwards, buoyant, weightless and hovering in place. This, clearly, was Martyn's groove. With the foundation of his own label, 3024, in 2007, Martyn confirmed his arrival as one of dubstep's distinctive new voices, a reputation he has reinforced across further singles and remixes of Scuba, TRG, Shut Up and Dance, among others. He has simultaneously resisted settling too comfortably into any one sound or scene; he and gauzy hip-hopper Flying Lotus have traded remixes, and he even delved into unadulterated house music on a remix for Detroit's Ican. Great Lengths is accordingly diverse, but it's also remarkably coherent. Most of its tracks fall within dubstep's stomping ground, clocking somewhere between 130 and 140 BPM and heaving with swing; it's underscored by a powerful bass presence that seems to stretch to infinity. But Martyn also pauses to explore other tempos and cadences: the churning ""Seventy Four"" is a plodding, dub-techno dirge, while ""Elden St."" marries 2-step syncopations to techno's steady 4/4 under cover of misty keys and fragmented soul vocals. The ambient interludes ""Bridge"" and ""Brilliant Orange"", meanwhile, suggest an affinity for moody soundtrack music. Neither is particularly memorable on its own, but they serve a useful purpose as a kind of mood glue, helping give the album its sense of flow. And Detroit techno's plangent chords carry across almost everything here, including the most broken, driving rhythms. This isn't Burial: Martyn is much more obviously a student of the dance floor. His rhythms are more cleanly drawn than Burial's, his sounds more pronounced. But a similar moodiness prevails, making this an album that ought to appeal to a wide swathe of listeners, including plenty who might not care about dubstep in the abstract. Even comparatively sprightly cuts like ""Little Things"" are awash in melancholic strings, and almost every track is driven by fat, stacked chords moving in formation. He's fond of chords voiced like the sampled rave stabs of yore-- blocky, fixed-interval things that lend an odd modal shiver as they go crab-walking up and down the scales. He makes even more out of dub's glancing tone clusters, which mark syncopated time while nervous counterpoints and nimble bass lines fill in the rest of the spectrum. And Martyn's bass is itself a thing to behold: it envelops without ever overpowering, suggesting at once the anchor and the play in the line leading from it. Even at his most uptempo, Martyn tends to sound guarded, even a little sullen. His rhythms hurtle and slice; there's a flailing desperation lurking behind the funk. At his best, as on tracks like ""Vancouver"" and ""Elden St."", his sounds seem to dissolve into themselves, the groove coiled like a hunched shoulder. It's here, I think, that Martyn sounds most like Martyn. He doesn't always hit his mark; the Spaceape-fronted ""Is This Insanity?"" sounds like he's merely stapled his trademark shirred chords to a structure modeled on Shackleton's percussive ethno-dubstep. And ""krdl-t-grv"", to my ears anyway, is too insistent in its two-bar repetitions and strident, detuned harmonies. But every selection on the album points to a particular vision, one expertly carried out in the marriage of force and tenderness, and of passion and craft.","Dutch producer Martyn is one of dubstep's most versatile talents, and his debut album shows a varied interpretation of the sound's possibilities.

Check Your Head: Deluxe Edition,Beastie Boys,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8ec0084474cd0c28ac/1:1/w_160/476b8f7c.jpg,2009-04-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12923-check-your-head-deluxe-edition/,Capitol,"Critical hindsight's declared Licensed to Ill their fun, guilty-pleasure introduction and Paul's Boutique their visionary artistic statement, but as history tells things it was Check Your Head that made sure the Beastie Boys were sticking around. It was their return to the Top 10 of Billboard's album chart, it reinvented them as a new mutation of the West Coast punk rocker via NYC, and it paved the way for their 1990s-hipster Grand Royal empire. Most of all, it reintroduced the Beastie Boys to a demographic that, three years after their previous album, was now said to listen to ""alternative rock""-- and at a time when being deep into hip-hop was still considered a sort of weird trait for a white teenager to have, that proved to be a canny lateral move. Nobody really knew at the time that numerous other, stupider, more aggro bands would take the punk-rap structure of Check Your Head and warp it into the testosterone-poisoned mookery of the Woodstock-torching late 90s. Nobody could predict that its meat-and-potatoes approach to live-band rap would soon be shown up spectacularly by the far tighter Roots. And nobody foresaw that the appeal of its loose, garage-funk instrumentals would begin to fade once Bosco Mann started Daptone rolling and showed people what the pros sounded like. So looking at Check Your Head in hindsight and saying it's aged poorly is largely an issue of unfortunate circumstance; I certainly remember it being fairly invigorating at the time (the time, in this case, being high school). So how's it hold up as its own thing, without the weight of 17 years of inferior imitations and superior refinements upon it? Well, if you look at it in terms of what they lost from their previous two albums, the biggest thing going against Check Your Head is its strange lack of the smart-assed, literate, quick-witted playfulness that had previously informed their lyrics. Never mind its most infamously-quotable lyric, from ""Pass the Mic""-- ""Everybody's rappin' like it's a commercial/ Actin' like life is a big commercial,"" which was supposed to rhyme ""rehearsal"" instead and got left in as a joke at Mike D's expense. Aside from the nimble ""Finger Lickin' Good"", the real issue is that most of the lyrics focus on sledgehammer impact at the expense of the high concepts and slippery wordplay they'd exhibited on Paul's Boutique. ""Jimmy James"" is still the jam, but it's surprising just how sketched-out and simple those otherwise vibrant-seeming lyrics are, and while the Rollins-grunt platitudes in ""Gratitude"" might sound energizing with those heavy-stomping Sabbath-funk riffs underneath, it's missing that spark of trickster glee that first made them great. If you didn't know better, you might think the lyrics on Check Your Head were an afterthought-- and, well, they kind of were. The album originally started out as a jam-heavy instrumental work, where the Beasties refamiliarized themselves with their instruments-- MCA on bass, Ad-Rock on guitar and Mike D on drums, with an odd assortment of session hands including carpenter/keyboardist ""Money Mark"" Nishita and percussionist Juanito Vazquez. Most of the album was built with an then-unconventional self-sampling approach, where live instruments were cut-up and reassembled from numerous takes, arising from ideas that spontaneously transmogrified and shot into different directions. In combining that approach with the overdriven, semi-lo-fi, blown-out production, it proved that the Beasties could find a new tack on their sonic workmanship without needing a Rick Rubin or some Dust Brothers to guide them (though co-producer Mario Caldato, Jr. proved a good partner). Still, it's a bit of a mishmash: sublime moments like the hallucinogenic peace-and-love dub of ""Something's Got to Give"" and the inspired weirdness of Sly & the Family Stone's ""Time for Livin'"" gone near-unrecognizable as hardcore punk have to share room with tracks that either sound a little too sloppily anything-goes (the rattletrap fuzz-rock ""Stand Together"") or come across like half-formed funk jams with great percussion, slinky Hammonds, not much else (""Funky Boss"" and ""Pow""). Lest you think the score's a bit uncharitable towards what many fans think is the Beasties' second-best album, it's factoring in this deluxe edition's bonus disc and warning you off buying this particular package. Yes, you get ""The Skills to Pay the Bills"", a shoulda-made-the-album B-side if there ever was one, but it also includes some of the least essential B-sides ever-- dick-around jokes like Mike D's yowling lounge act ""Netty's Girl"", the RZA-sniffing-paint kung-fu-funk goof ""Drunken Praying Mantis Style"", the unremitting horror of ""Boomin' Granny""-- as well as some completists-only live tracks and more versions of ""So What Cha Want"" than you will likely ever need (feel free to draw the line after the classic Soul Assassin remix). Plus you get ""Drinkin' Wine"", in case you ever wanted evidence that the Beasties had a Side 6 of Sandinista! moment. Maybe Check Your Head doesn't hit the same rap-geek nerves that Licensed to Ill or Paul's Boutique did, but let's look at it this way: It was a worthwhile experiment that resulted in some vital music. The Beastie Boys knew that Paul's was finding appreciation as a cult album, but they couldn't recapture its feeling, not after its commercial failure left them practically forced to take a new tack. Making that approach a smaller-budget, DIY/punk mutation of everything they'd  tried along the way and starting from the ground up as a band rather than a crew of MCs was an inspired idea. Going back to the studio to polish that approach up resulted in their second #1 album, 1994's Ill Communication, which does most of what Check Your Head does just a little better and funnier. But if time has diluted the impact of Check Your Head, clamping on some ear goggles and turning the EQ to its most bass-expanding level is compensation enough.","The landmark album gets a remaster and a reissue, complete with a sadly inessential bonus disc of remixes and B-sides.

Oohs & Aahs,Say Hi,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3509d034d5c69bf2db7/1:1/w_160/e8028ffa.jpg,2009-04-13 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12863-oohs-aahs/,Barsuk,"Some time last year, prior to the release of his fifth album, The Wishes and the Glitch, Eric Elbogen shortened the name of his project from Say Hi to Your Mom to just Say Hi. Call it growing up, refining the message, or whatever you want to, but it's easy to see why a guy might eventually want to leave the playground insult behind for something more all-embracing. Now based in Seattle, Elbogen is still making music for pocket-sized arenas, cramming big gestures into a small sound. Oohs & Aahs fits into his usual semi-hi-fi aesthetic, at least in terms of the way the arrangements are presented, but there's something off about the way the vocals are recorded on almost the whole record. They get almost completely lost when listening on headphones because the echo applied to them makes them so indistinct-- they flutter around and the melody blurs off the beat. On speakers, his voice sounds better, but it's still not pleasing. Elbogen also adopts a most mush-mouthed approach, requiring the listener to crane an awful lot to hear the lyrics that are so central to his music. This isn't another quasi-concept record about vampires like 2006's Impeccable Blahs, but still, comprehensibility is nice. It's too bad, because many of these songs have quite a bit going for them otherwise. Opener ""Elouise"" is as good an example as any, opening with a good fuzz bass part and some tolling piano chords before the big guitar texture kicks in. And then, well, there's some tuneful mumbling from a guy who sounds like he has marbles in his mouth, something about the high 90s FM station or something. As big a hang-up as that is, Elbogen sings more clearly through the echo on much on the rest of the album, and he has some good stuff going on here, like the pointillist horn theme that opens the propulsive ""Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh"", the little piano eruption on ""Hallie and Henry"", and the big, almost majestic keyboard theme that underpins the floaty almost-anthem ""Maurine"". These songs are concise and to the point, sometimes to their own detriment: ""Dramatic Irony"" feels like it's just getting going when it suddenly ends. The album's highlight is ""One, Two... One"", if only for the brilliant chorus that comes tumbling out of nowhere over the vaguely 1980s instrumental bed. Elbogen harmonizes with himself, and the excess reverb hurts the precision a bit, but it still injects an exciting little whiff of jazz into the song. Fans of mid-fi one-man indie bands and anyone who loved Elbogen's when he was still Say Hi To Your Mom will undoubtedly find things to like about it, but Oohs & Ahs is ultimately a decent record that's weighed down a bit by some puzzling sonics.","Singer-songwriter Eric Elbogen, who formerly worked under the name Say Hi to Your Mom, returns for a sixth album of one-man band indie pop.

Space Programs,The USA Is a Monster,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3715e6ef9596932064f/1:1/w_160/c5bbd075.jpg,2009-04-13 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12890-space-programs/,Load,"The USA Is a Monster are, in their poetic way, patriots. Caught between hippie repose and punk venom, the band's political vision lends their music its ""so anti-American, it's American"" attitude. Loyal fans already know, from their records and their shamanic artwork, that their unforgiving posture toward history lines up best with Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, the early chapters of Howard Zinn's People's History, Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, and those ""Original Homeland Security"" T-shirts with the rifle-toting Indians. On Space Programs, their fourth album, they take another glance at our republic's origin myths through a glass darkly. Blown out with antic energy, the record peels forward with ""Cocaine Wedding"". Celebrity mavens may link the title to the chemically enhanced matrimony of Eddie Van Halen and Valerie Bertinelli; certainly the song's sound and structure, abruptly upshifting and downshifting out of its muscle-car rhythms, trace the manic arc of doomed love. But, in the end, the USA is always the subject with the USA Is a Monster, so maybe moral rot and the cult of celebrity are the true issues, and all the song's hints of a circus atmosphere, thanks to Johnny Mateo's fiery trombone, are jabs at the era of Britney. ""Ice Bridge"" immediately flings us back into the usual TUSAIAM territory, telling a searing tale about man's lust for the unknown, beginning calmly, then taking their trademark singsong vocals about Norsemen and Cheyenne medicine men over a rocky landscape of monumental riffs and rhythms. Out of drifting time signatures and drawn-out harmonies, they carve a sense of aimless, star-crossed wandering. Whether Americans, Europeans, or the so-called natives are the wanderers, it isn't always easy to tell. While that virginal past occupies much of their time, ominous signs of the future are everywhere. On the laser-synthed ""Frozen Rainbows"" and the frenzied early bars of ""Above All It's the Songs"", the band sounds like it is siphoning beats from proggy Nintendo soundtracks. (Think ""Contra"".) The clean tones and blistering velocity call to mind the nerdy precision of both the Advantage and their Load Records compatriots Lightning Bolt. Then add to that technocratic flavor a little dash of the Teutonic. Arguably, the loops here (especially on ""Tulsa"", ""Above All It's the Songs"") have that icy Krautrock ease that would fit nicely in a Neu! record: it's the tangled, Magma-style noodling, the childlike and chanting delivery, and the spacebound solos (""Florida"") that set it apart, giving the record not only a mystical texture but astronomical scale. Compared to past releases, the new keeps just the right amount of the pastoral: not much. The record is called Space Programs, after all. Where their last outing, Wohaw, strayed too far into the protest-folk forests of Woodstock, Space Programs finds a better balance of campfire intimacy and the slashing intricacy of Sunset at the End of the Industrial Age. More a lyrical evocation, rather than a merciless deconstruction, of the white man's burden, the Trail of Tears, manifest destiny, empire, and James Kirk's final frontier, the record fits neatly into the USA Is a Monster's furious discography.","Caught between hippie repose and punk venom, TUSAIAM's politics and unforgiving posture toward history is more American than the machines it rages against.

Total Pop! Deluxe Box,Erasure,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a369c0084474cd0c027c/1:1/w_160/d252f889.jpg,2009-04-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12884-total-pop-deluxe-box/,MuteSireRhino,"When Erasure released Pop! The First 20 Hits in 1992, it was a greatest-hits that was practically a boast: 20 consecutive singles, almost every one of them a significant UK hit. After darting from project to project for the first half of the 1980s, songwriter/synth dude Vince Clarke had finally formed a lasting partnership (with Andy Bell, whose voice still sounds uncannily like Clarke's old Yaz partner Alison Moyet). If they didn't have the range and wit of Pet Shop Boys, the other major homophilic synth-pop duo of their era, they had all the hooks anyone could ask for, and they damn sure had a flashier singer-- even minor singles like ""You Surround Me"" let Bell show off his post-Boy George soul chops and stratospheric falsetto. Clarke's treble-range synthesizers sound chintzy and fakey now; that's how they sounded at the time, too, but that was their purpose-- to be the sound of the prefabricated future. Pop!'s final song (not counting a remix of ""Who Needs Love [Like That]"") was a cover of ABBA's ""Take a Chance on Me"" that gave the game away: Clarke's dream was to be Benny and Björn rolled into one, a technician of irresistible, precision-tooled camp. (The earlier Erasure single ""Stop!"" had basically been a diagonal cross-section of ""Take a Chance on Me"", too.) Total Pop! is an expansion of Pop!, beginning with the original album in toto. That collection represented Erasure's first seven years; it's taken another 17 to generate enough material for a second disc's worth of singles. The strict chronology means that disc two leads with its one bona fide jewel: 1994's ""Always"", blessed with an upward-spiraling melody that justifies the ""Like a Prayer"" choir behind Bell. But that year was also when they started following the trends of electronic music (""Run to the Sun"") rather than cheerfully ignoring them, and since then they've trudged through all the requisite career-extenders: the flaccid hope-you-like-our-new-direction experiment (1995's Erasure), the guess-you-preferred-our-old-direction backtrack (1997's Cowboy), the album of obvious covers (2003's Other People's Songs-- seriously, ""Solsbury Hill""?), the acoustic-versions-of-old-stuff album (2006's Union Street). The later singles are superficially very much like the early ones; the difference is that Clarke's electronics have come to mostly just underscore Bell's singing, rather than engage it with countermelodies and cross-rhythms. And then there's the third disc, ""Live 1987-2007"", which adds little besides room tone, slightly different arrangements and the occasional bit of crowd noise to Erasure's studio recordings-- their live performances are long on spectacle (hence the DVD also included with the set) but short on revelation. There's yet another installment in their string of ABBA covers, ""Voulez Vous"" (preceded by an a cappella verse of ""Mamma Mia""); there's yet another version of ""Who Needs Love"", this time from 1996, accompanied by wildly inapposite live drums and chugging guitars. (Oh, the 90s.) Clarke's gift as a songwriter is his sense of melody, which hasn't entirely deserted him-- 2007's ""Sunday Girl"" (not a Blondie cover) delivers the goods almost as much as anything on the original Pop! But Erasure has never quite pulled off the vulnerable universality and radiant ache that gave their Swedish idols depth and staying power. An hour's worth of their hits is about all it's possible to take before sugar-crash sets in. A second best-of-- disc two, in other words-- would've been a useful if lesser companion to the first; confining it to this bloated box makes it considerably less fun.","A sequel to the solid Pop! singles comp, this 3xCD/DVD collection adds a live disc plus 17 years' worth of tracks you may not realize even existed.

In the meantime, Broken Social Scenester Haines, the baby-voiced heart and soul of the band, recorded and released an intimate solo album and its companion EP. Those solemn, torch song-like collections stripped her of Metric's new wave gloss, exposing raw nerves and more seasoned vocals. Guitarist James Shaw toured with BSS, allowing him to stretch his riffs beyond Metric's rudimentary pop chug. (He also expanded his sonic palette by producing the Lovely Feathers' debut.) And Metric's rhythm section became Bang Lime, a dance-y post-punk duo that picked up where Metric left off on Live It Out, leaving behind keyboards to mine rock riffage from candy-coated confections. So when the foursome finally reunited last year, they had grown beyond the charming borders of their pop sound, and their fourth album is all the better for it. Though Shaw's more nuanced guitars have supplanted synthesizers as the focal instrument, the change in aesthetic still seems credited to Haines. The newfound vulnerability and gravitas she explored on her solo work has found its way onto Fantasies, though instead of dark, death-obsessed sentiments, there is a dreamy quality here that eschews the vague, easy rhymes and lyrical polemics of past Metric records in favor of romance and sex. Metric are often compared to fellow BSS satellite Stars, but while that band's Amy Millan and Torquil Campbell get soggy on their slower moments, Haines embraces more personal sentiments on ballads ""Blindness"" and ""Collect Call"", whose stripped-down, twinkly arrangements keep Metric's glam side intact yet cut the inessential sugar and bombast. Further embracing their moody, minimal instincts on ""Twilight Galaxy"" created one of Fantasies' standouts. In the end however, Fantasies' other crowd-pleasers are, unsurprisingly, songs with big hooks, bursting choruses, and slick synths-- ""Help I'm Alive"" and ""Sick Muse"". The story here though is the album's simmering, intimate moments-- and despite the fanbase-building qualities of their new-wave past, the more the group embraces an inky, ambient future, the better it  could get.","After four years, Broken Social scenester Emily Haines' primary band finally releases a set of new material.

Lotusflow3r / MPLSound / Elixer,PrinceBria Valente,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38fc0084474cd0c02c5/1:1/w_160/1af5c7e7.jpg,2009-04-13 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12911-lotusflow3r-mplsound-elixer/,NPG,"For several days, Lotusflow3r/MPLSound sat on my hard drive, daring me to click play. I finally acquiesced, knowing this review was due, and suddenly realized how much my relationship with Prince has changed over the past 20 years. His rise to success, beginning with 1979's Prince, pretty much mirrored my pre-adolescent development as a music fan. By 1987's Sign O' the Times, I was ripping the cellophane off the cassingles when barely out of the store, hoping to soak up a little of that Princely aura even if it would be hours before I'd be near my tape deck. Like many who came of age when each new Prince album expanded our conception of pop, I've already struggled through plenty of self-cannibalized sketches and ever-more-mawkish ballads and unsuccessful experiments to locate the canon-worthy songs lurking in his decade-plus of hubristic over-production. I know a jumble of decent tunes, lackluster jams, and outright dreck invariably awaits on any Tuesday morning bearing a new Prince album. This time around, and in several key ways, we get a partial throwback to the Prince records I greedily inhaled as a tween. (For one thing I bought a physical copy at a chain department store, something I haven't regularly done since I could drive.) That added a little twist to my distress when I realized that, at age 31, I was actually kind of dreading my first play of a new Prince album. It's a future the 12-year-old me would not have wanted to reach. Assessing a new Prince album all but demands forced objectivity and willfully ignoring his first decade as a recording artist. Want to look like an idiot? Write a screed lamenting the fact that an artist has failed to consistently entertain, let alone surprise or enlighten, for over 30 years. But what's left, once you choose the road of sane detachment, other than a review that can be summed up as ""predictably imperfect, your mileage may vary""? Hence my low-level dread. So here's my hardly original thesis, which many could have guessed even before clicking: Don't buy this album unless you're willing to do the work of winnowing it down to the tracks you find enjoyable/passable. Two new Prince albums (plus a third disc we'll get to in a minute) for the price of one might as well come with a giant sparkly sticker that reads ""For Obsessive Amateur Editors Only."" Filler on a 21st century Prince album? Do purple pontiffs leave paisley piles in the Minnesota woods? Lotusflow3r is mostly neutral funk-rock. When I say ""funk-rock,"" I don't mean the taut, digitally enhanced amalgam Prince invented/perfected in the 1980s. I mean the looser variety, amenable to extended onstage takes, that friend and foe alike would describe as ""organic,"" albeit with very different inflections. It's a sound that works best when he observes three important guidelines: 1) He restrains the stock guitar heroics (has anyone's instrumental creativity been more effectively hampered by being repeatedly declared the last great virtuoso?), 2) He keeps the tempos club-friendly (or at least friendly in the context of old-school weekend at the 40-and-over spot), and 3) He remembers his faux rivalry with fellow funkateer Morris Day was more productive than his imagined rivalry with musically ignorant young folks. But when I say ""neutral,"" unfortunately I mean pretty much exactly what you probably think I mean. The only track with an immediately memorable hook is his cover of ""Crimson and Clover"", which would be sadder if he hadn't been obscuring his preternatural catchiness for some time now. On Lotusflow3r, as on all of his albums since he became a classicist by intent and a live workhorse out of necessity, Prince mistakenly assumes instrumental prowess to be of primary importance to anyone other than online guitar-tab traders, while also displaying an unflattering and near-constant need to prove he can hang with the multi-cultural heroes who shaped his worldview. There's no need to genuflect when you've long since been admitted to the pantheon. If Lotusflow3r is generic and too-reverential modern day muso Prince, then MPLSound is either crass or delusional. It's crass if it's a conceptual cash-grab, Prince bald-facedly pastiching his own 80s sound as a profitable parlor game. Times being vice-tight, presumably even for those with the renewable resource of a deep catalog of hall-of-fame hits, dusting off the drum machine makes a certain sad sense, and a by-numbers ballad like ""Here"" sounds undeniably better backed by its twee little keyboard hook than, like, a flute. It's delusional if he's serious, because it means he thinks these flimsy self-homages wouldn't sound anemic next to tunes from Purple Rain or Parade, which you can at least write off as the kind of perception-free baloney we expect from geniuses of his stripe. Either way, MPLSound is (surprise) momentarily enjoyable and completely inessential, happy to provoke Palovian responses since the hard work of honestly juicing your head, heart, or hips is antithetical to the whole idea. Sure, you can still sieve off a few decent tracks for your ""Prince in the Aughts"" playlist; the Camille redux of ""Dance 4 Me"" is my personal choice, if only because he tries to shoehorn in all of the sex/religion/androgyne clichés. But while I'd pick electro-funk Prince over jazz-funk Prince every day of the week, the proximity of Lotusflow3r makes the pleasures of MPLSound feel even more hollow, like it's merely a spoonful of synth-driven sugar designed to sell naysayers on the non-electronic new stuff Prince wants you to cherish as much as the old faves. Elixer, the aforemetioned third disc, is actually by newcomer Bria Valente, who should at least be happy she's been able to piggyback her way to bad reviews in national publications, rather than languishing in the promo bin purgatory to which she'd be consigned if her producer was a cousin with a copy of Pro Tools. Elixer runs the gamut of bland-but-classy R&B, from antiseptic slow jams to rote dance-pop, slick as you'd expect and completely failing to suggest what bunched Prince's panties when he initially discovered Valente. Many of Prince's pet projects have been little more than ventriloquist's dummies-- excepting skilled musicians like Sheila E. or irrepressible lunatics like Morris Day, the master hasn't had much patience for personality-driven showboats-- but any trace of weirdness or wit or actual eroticism has seemingly been purged from Valente's performance at Jehovah's request, which reflects worse on egomaniacal producer than nominal artiste in this case. Like some depressing footnote to the whole Lotusflow3r/MPLSound experience, Elixer sparked my final sad realization about my current relationship with Prince and his product: Who knew I'd one day get wistful for the vacuous but honestly carnal fluff of ""Sex Shooter""?","Three discs' worth of new Prince material-- one credited to his new protégé Bria Valente-- sold only online or through Target.

The label's current overhauled lineup stumps a lot of casual fans, its stylistic (and geographic) makeup undergoing a marked change since Conor Oberst started devoting more time to his Team Love imprint. Singer-songwriter Orenda Fink, with Azure Ray and her left-of-center solo pursuits, has always had one foot in Bright Eyes/Rilo Kiley-style signature Creek folk while the other wades into murkier waters. She's been both part of the label's traditional bedrock and an augury of its (still ongoing) makeover. Teamed with Scalpelist (new random moniker of Cedric LeMoyne, formerly of Remy Zero) as O+S (get it?), Fink once again strives for an artistic obliqueness that staves off obligatory Saddle Creek teen TV drama soundtrack jokes while still sounding undeniably like an Orenda Fink record. While her brooding solo album Invisible Ones introduced us to a more spiritual Orenda Fink, the new wrinkle this time lies more within the instrumental arrangements. Sharing an interest in field recordings, shoegaze, and David Lynch soundtracks, Fink and LeMoyne's mission is to couch her folksy pop in vast, surreal sonic environs. When they keep this goal in mind, they get results. Fink's lethargic melodies lend themselves to the dream-pop of Julee Cruise or even Ladytron, and the café conversations, street clamor, and other field recordings peppered throughout the album provide an ethereal feel that Invisible Ones sorely lacked. On the Lynchian end of the spectrum, heady standouts ""New Life"", ""Survive Love"", and ""Knowing Animals"" make good on the collaboration's phantasmal promise. ""New Life"" opens the album with sluggish drum loops and an eerie Dopplering ambience that casts Fink as a kind of schizophrenic Enya. ""It's not a new life/ It's the same old one,"" she sings, while the track, along with synth-laden 1980s hymn ""Survive Love"" and the Portishead-inspired ""Knowing Animals"", suggests otherwise. Yet vestiges of Fink's more staid material crop up on the album despite the duo's best attempts to hedge them with their new quirks. ""The Fox"" and ""My Friend"" sound like Fink leftovers, bare-boned coffeehouse fixtures that have little use for LeMoyne's contributions. While the songwriting on ""Lonely Ghosts"" stays in cruise control, they spruce up the unspectacular piano ballad with a screeching UFO-like sound effect and off-kilter harmonies, though the track doesn't feel like the most effective appropriation of these new tools. Those blander tracks not only disrupt the album's ethereal tone, they basically contradict O+S's raison d'être. Whether it's the newfound rhythm on ""Permanent Scar"" and ""What Do We Want To"" or the unsettling moodiness of the aforementioned highlights, there are moments here that rank as Fink's most dynamic to date. After all, a few years ago it'd be unfathomable to see the Notwist, Portishead, and M83 mentioned in the same review as either of these artists, but the similarities are here and they're the best product of the collaboration. Always the intrepid mind, Fink has found a promising partner in LeMoyne to bring out her weirder side, and once they do away with a few lingering old habits, the duo could prove an artistic pinnacle for both parties.","Orenda Fink (former Azure Ray) teams with Cedric LeMoyne (former Remy Zero) for a dream-pop project on Saddle Creek.

Play Music,Thieves Like Us,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a352ea9e61561daa4c54/1:1/w_160/e0ba60d6.jpg,2009-04-10 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12865-play-music/,Fantasy MemoryShelflife,"Sensitive clubbers of the world, unite. Thieves Like Us singer Andy Grier, an American, met keyboardist Björn Berglund and drummer Pontus Berghe, both Swedes, when they all lived in Berlin. The Tron-loving filter-house electro-poppers now call Paris home, and French label Kitsuné picked up their big single, the euphoric but also melancholic downtown-metro ride ""Drugs in My Body"". Debut album Play Music was variously conceived and created in Berlin, Vienna, New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, and Stockholm. Finally getting a belated U.S. release, the disc justifies some but not all of its carbon footprint. New Order's 1984 hit ""Thieves Like Us"" exemplified how those UK synth-pop icons could take something ""so uncool""-- like love of tech gadgetry-- and give it a certain expensively wasted glamor. ""Drugs in My Body"" adapts this strategy for our post-Daft Punk ears. It's hyper-urban strobe-pop, with aching vocals and a tightly coiled Durutti Column sample that could appeal not only to don't-call-it-blog-house LastNightsPartyers, but also to Factory-worshiping indie bedwetters like me. The full album should be an okay soundtrack for a hoverbus tour of some retrofuturistic metropolis, but it's somewhere just outside of track 3 when the Dramamine starts to kick in. Play Music slows down more often than your Justice Mobile Digitalisms, and when it does it tends to lose some focus. Unfortunately, the horn-haunted nighttime cityscape of ""An Easy Tonight"" sounds less like the City of Lights than the City That Makes Me Kinda Sleepy; the solid but unremarkable kosmische of ""Lady"" needs something a little more distinctive alongside its tasteful woundedness. Most of the singing was recorded at home, which helps it sound sincere, but also helps it sound like a specific, time-fixed notion of sinceirty (won't anyone just let Ian Curtis rest in peace?). Shoulda-been instrumental ""Program of the Second Part"" suggests, ""Sing along to Suicide."" Of course, smuggling open-hearted vocal frailness into ecstatic electronic dance-pop can still have thrilling results, as New Order showed, and the likes of the Tough Alliance continue to demonstrate. Thieves Like Us are usually best when they're giving us a spoonful of sugar to help the miserabilia go down-- feeling low at a higher tempo on ""Your Heart Feels"", for example, or daydreaming about David and Angela Bowie on the similarly faster-paced ""Miss You"". ""Drugs in My Body"" B-side ""Fass"" also does all right despite meh meta lyrics about crossing ""scene lines."" But the second-best thing here actually has to be finale ""Sugar and Song"", a sure-enough slow breakup ballad that's as depressive as so much good Spiritualized. Although Play Music drags more than I would've hoped, it's still a reasonably lustrous place to be sad now and then-- without drugs in my body, but not without ""Drugs in My Body"".","International electro-pop group got its start via Kitsuné and finally has its debut LP released in the U.S.

The Love Language,The Love Language,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a340b1335d7bf16986ba/1:1/w_160/73536272.jpg,2009-04-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12850-the-love-language/,Bladen County,"A lo-fi approach to recording obscures many things-- instrumental interplay, subtle shifts in vocal tone, lyrics-- but one thing it never masks is enthusiasm. In fact, lo-fi almost always accentuates it, which is why even the most financially solvent of bands have been known to purposefully muddy or smear their sound, sacrificing clarity for intensity and choosing mystery over transparency. If you read much music criticism you'll know (and I'm as guilty as anyone) that some of the gravest pejoratives are ""tasteful,"" ""mannered,"" and ""polite."" And of course, it's damn near impossible to sound tasteful or polite when your songs are coming through layers of hiss, distortion, and fuzz. Embracing a lo-fi aesthetic is certainly an acceptable and useful tool for communicating your music, but ideally the tunes themselves should be strong enough to stand on their own. It would be unfair to say an album like the Love Language's self-titled debut is a failure unless you can imagine the songs would've sounded just as good had they been recorded squeakily clean. Still, it's almost invariably the case that hooks and melodies (which The Love Language luckily has in spades), and not technique, are what keeps a listener returning over and over again. As a touring entity, the Love Language are a seven-piece band currently based in Raleigh, N.C., yet their eponymous first LP was written and recorded solely by frontman Stuart McLamb. Like recent indie breakthroughs Wavves and Times New Viking, McLamb uses lo-fi as a filter for his keen pop sensibilities, though his approach is far friendlier and less abrasive than either of those acts. Over the brief 29-minute course of the album, McLamb cycles through a wide range of indie-rock, country, and early-pop styles, all delivered with shouty charm and in-the-red verve, roughly approximating a sock-hop-era Arcade Fire. Particularly effervescent are ""Lalita"", which rides a bold fuzzed-out guitar line and equally demonstrative drums to somehow convey shambling joy in spite of its embittered lyrics, and ""Sparxxx"", which sounds like a great lost Nugget from a band of forgotten garage moptops, making endearing use of a xylophone. Suffice to say, instruments bleed into each other pretty liberally here, creating a boisterous racket McLamb only emphasizes with his heavy reliance on tambourine, most generously deployed on the punch-drunk, waltzing ""Nocturne"" (which is also outfitted with a neat little surf guitar lick) and the closing ""Graycourt"". Lyrically this is a record undeniably tinged with romantic strife, yet, unlike lovelorn former Raleigh denizen Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, McLamb's songs are largely energetic and sprightly. Even the spare and clearly aggrieved opener, ""Two Rabbits"" exudes McCartney-ish charms, while the country-tinged moper ""Stars"" musically exudes such a bygone innocence that it's hard to evince any real emotional peril. Of course, a cringe-worthy line like ""little girls tell the biggest lies"" certainly doesn't help, but blessedly it's soon subsumed, like everything else, beneath sweetly obfuscating blankets.","Like Wavves and Times New Viking, this band uses lo-fi as a filter for pop sensibilities, though its approach is friendlier and less abrasive than those acts.

Leaves in the Gutter / Like It or Not,SuperchunkWwax,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37b9d034d5c69bf2e26/1:1/w_160/95df05ea.jpeg,2009-04-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12897-leaves-in-the-gutter-like-it-or-not/,Merge,"The last time Superchunk released a new studio album was Here's to Shutting Up, in 2001. They didn't shut up or break up; they just went into near-hibernation, playing the occasional show, releasing some live albums, and not doing much else. In the meantime, Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance's label, Merge Records, has become a significantly bigger deal, and Portastatic has become McCaughan's main musical project, releasing four full-length studio albums (as well as a pile of EPs and demo collections and a soundtrack). And now Superchunk are apparently in the early stages of preparing a new full-length record, so their new five-track, four-song EP basically exists to clear out the material they've worked up for their intermittent live sets over the last eight years. (""Misfits and Mistakes"", written for the Aqua Teen Hunger Force movie, turned up on a single in 2007.) It sounds exactly like what Superchunk were doing 15 years ago: McCaughan yell-singing those strained high notes of his, dual-guitar solos, fast, heavy unambiguous rock. ""Learned to Surf"", which gets reprised in a casual acoustic version at the end, hints at perspective on the band's longevity and its dropping out of the indie-rock rat race--""I can't hold my breath anymore/ I stopped swimming and learned to surf,"" the chorus goes-- but you wouldn't know it by its meat-and-potatoes arrangement. As always, McCaughan's songs are impeccably constructed, with clever bits of craftsmanship everywhere, from the gyroscopic riff that opens the disc to the way ""Knock Knock Knock"" builds up to its jump-shot of a chorus. The band's chemistry is untouched by time: They're still speedy, locked-in, and spring-chickeny. But even Superchunk once moved past what they were doing 15 years ago-- their last couple of albums preserved their instrumental voices but stretched them beyond headlong heaviness. This is a perfectly solid throwback by a band that's smart enough to know better. Before there was Superchunk, there was Wwax, a trio of McCaughan with Brian Walsby and Wayne Taylor, whose complete studio recordings, plus a live Saccharine Trust cover, are collected on the digital-only Like It or Not. 1987 and 1988, when all of these songs were recorded, was a transitional moment in American independent rock, as young bands across the country were trying to figure out how to get past the formulae of punk and into something grimy enough that nobody could mistake it for mainstream pop. Wwax's sole for-the-ages song was the A-side of their first single, ""Pumpkin"", which is just about Superchunk straight out of the gate-- the hyper lead guitar, the steady flow of riffs that don't congeal into anything as straightforward as verse-chorus-bridge, McCaughan pushing his voice as high as it will go without actually breaking. The songs his bandmates sing are less impressive. They've got a solid stomp to them, and they mess around with tempos and time signatures entertainingly, but a lot of them come off as slightly desperate stabs toward independence. ""Like It or Not"" and ""Straw Man"", in particular, keep toppling over into x-on-the-hands 4/4 riffery, then crawling out again. It's a historically interesting album, rather than a good one; you can hear snatches of what would be coming out of North Carolina a few years later, but you can also hear Wwax falling into the potholes on the road toward it.","Superchunk return to the studio for the first time in almost a decade, plus Merge unearths tracks from Mac McCaughan's former band, Wwax.

Two Suns,Bat for Lashes,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38e5e6ef9596932068c/1:1/w_160/0f96ed5e.jpg,2009-04-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12910-two-suns/,AstralwerksParlophone,"Natasha Khan likes pretty things: fur, gold, melody, the moon, feathers, things that sparkle, chords that resolve. Since she began recording and performing as Bat For Lashes a few years back, the Brighton native has loosely assembled those things around her person like so many thrift store trinkets. Were it not for ""What's a Girl to Do?"", the lone song from her otherwise-too-precious 2006 debut to suggest that she might have the chilly songwriting charisma to match her outward appearance, it could have been easy to write Khan off as nothing more than an over-reaching asthete. Actually, to be honest, that temptation remains. Khan's aesthetic is such a perfectly struck balancing act between earth mother hippie mystic and post-modern Gen Y art student (see: the cover for her latest single ""Daniel"", which depicts her on a beach, shivery and windswept, with a painting of The Karate Kid's Daniel LaRusso adorning her entire naked back) that it's difficult to forget about the sheer workaday craft that must go into constantly seeming so effortlessly, artfully rumpled. Nonetheless, as of Two Suns, her second full-length album, all of that takes a backseat. A significant step forward from her debut, Two Suns is home to some of the year's most thrilling music so far. Khan's real breakthrough might simply be her willingness to wear her influences more brazenly. One needn't have any more than a basic working knowledge of female innovators from the past few decades to be able to spot the ghosts lurking around this stage. The strident piano chords and lone snare of ""Traveling Woman"" echoes PJ Harvey's desolate roadsongs, while ""Moon and Moon""'s delicate piano playing and cabinet-reverbed backing vocals evoke early Tori Amos. Elsewhere, with its pummeling rhythms, double-timed handclaps, glass harmonica trills and vocal histrionics, the moonstruck rave-up ""Two Planets"" owes its entire existence to Björk. But even in the moments where those influences risk running on the wrong side of overt, they never feel stolen or unearned. Just as Khan seems most comfortable when she's adorned in a patchwork of styles, eras, and ideologies, this record feels more satisfying and fully formed for its overt cutting and pasting of those different sensibilities. What's more heartening, though, is that during Two Suns' highlights, Khan has few peers. I could probably fill this entire space just writing about ""Glass"", the album's aggressively propulsive opener, and about how its strange mix of elements (chamber pop, prog metal, new age-- what?) magically coalesced into some entirely new genre that I wish existed and yet still can't quite wrap my brain around. Then there's the booming ""Sleep Alone"", which, with its rusty guitar licks, Knife-inspired synths, buzzing basslines and floorboard percussions, feels kind of like a sea shanty circa 2074. Or the aforementioned ""Daniel"", the album's first single, which marries brittle, 80s-influenced electro and an inspired viola arrangement with what has to be, hands down, one of the most insidious choruses of the year. For all that, though, the album's most vindicating moment comes at the end. Clocking in at just under three minutes long, closer ""The Big Sleep"" consists of a swoonsome duet between Khan and a suitably broody Scott Walker. Accompanied by nothing more than a stormy piano coda, the pair dip and dive around each other, stringing out syllables, dancing around each others' voices and generally soaking in the drama. Not only does Khan hold her own, there are moments when she holds his, too. That she's capable of doing so is evidence enough that we should be paying attention.","A significant step forward from her debut, Natasha Khan's Two Suns is home to some of the year's most thrilling music so far.

A Fool For Everyone,Mike Bones,by: David Raposa,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35f5e6ef9596932062a/1:1/w_160/c4e7ba78.jpg,2009-04-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12876-a-fool-for-everyone/,Social Registry,"Musically, Mike Bones' second solo album is a not-unwelcome departure from the sounds and pedigree of his debut. While the Social Registry is still the label that pays him, and he's reaching out to the same group of New Yorkers that helped him out the first time around, A Fool For Everyone is an effort that's decidedly more ""rock"" and less ""indie."" Where The Sky Behind the Sea emphasized the textures and spaces in his songs, the new album is more interested in giving a platform to show off his hot licks and bluesy grooves. Coupled with a cover that recalls the hirsute pose jazz flautist Herbie Mann struck for his 1971 album, Push Push, A Fool For Everyone affects the airs of a not-unpleasant 1970s-era singer-songwriter LP-- had this been released 10 years ago, Bones might've found himself with a Drag City label deal and on tour trading solos with Jim O'Rourke during the latter's Eureka/Insignificance phase. Unfortunately, as with his first album, the pleasing airs last only as long as Bones chooses to ignore the ""singer"" portion of the equation. I don't mean this as a slight against Bones' singing voice, though its flatness-- coupled with an aw-shucksy tic-- pushes it into acquired-taste territory. That said, the album's bluesy tenor does wonders to mitigate its shortcomings, something that the debut's spacious environs couldn't do. With Fool, the problems mostly reside in the words that Bones sings. Throughout the album, Bones aims to offer poetic yet plain-spoken bon mots about the hard knocks of the human condition. What he ends up with is obvious images and unsurprising rhyming couplets. If Lou Reed, as Lester Bangs once surmised, was a student of the ""I walked to the chair/ Then I sat in it"" school of lyrics, then Bones can consider himself a certified graduate of the ""I walked to the chair/ It had four legs and was made of wood"" community college. In other words, when he sings ""show the vampire my biggest vein,"" it's no surprise that he follows up with ""make two holes for the blood to drain."" It starts with the despondent verses of ""Today the World Is Worthy of My Loathing"", and continues all the way through ""Everybody's Coming Down on Me"". In case it's not obvious by those lugubrious song titles, Bones presents himself as a hard-luck, sad sack. ""Hate and shame fill me,"" he muses on ""Much More Than Love"", which might be why, as he notes in ""Like a Politician"", that ""the meanness of the world [has] prematurely lined my face."" But what can you do? ""The heart's a vicious master,"" he warbles on ""Give Up on Guitars"", ""but we've given him our word."" And so on, ad nauseum. Hopefully Bones knows enough never to heed the advice of that aforementioned song title. When he keeps quiet and lets the music (and especially his guitar playing) do the talking, the album shines. The gradual crescendo of ""What I Have Left"", where Bones' harried strums are slowly matched up with a rush of piano and strings and rolling drums, is by far the disc's musical highlight. It's followed by the woozy violin-led torpor of ""Much More Than Love"", the one song that comes closest to fitting Bones' lyrical and vocal bent. But as I mentioned previously, the music's not the problem here-- hit ""Mute"" on Bones the Singer, and the tracks on A Fool For Everyone would be more than capable of serving another vocalist's needs. If there are more Mike Bones records planned for the future, it might behoove him to focus solely on his six-string.","Still on the excellent Social Registry label, Mike Bones' latest is decidedly more rock and less indie.

Songs About Dancing and Drugs,Circlesquare,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d85e6ef959693204fa/1:1/w_160/3fadf6c8.jpeg,2009-04-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12767-songs-about-dancing-and-drugs/,!K7,"The title of Circlesquare's second full-length is direct and accurate, but it's also something of an understatement. Dancing and drugs are indeed mentioned in nearly every track, but, as subject matter for pop songs, they're well-trod territory. What makes the record interesting is the way Circlesquare mastermind Jeremy Shaw uses dancing and drugs as a starting point for exploring his larger themes, i.e., the constant mutation and evolution of subcultures, and the rapid acceleration of science and technology. In Shaw's work, which extends from his music to his parallel career in fine art, dancing and drugs are salvations in and of themselves, and desperately needed coping mechanisms in a fast-moving culture that can leave us feeling disconnected and disoriented. If one can assume a consistent narrative voice on the album, the protagonist of Songs About Dancing and Drugs is a man who feels as though culture and time itself is out of synch with his reality, and that celebration and narcotics have become his way of either finding his footing within the moment, or slipping outside of it. The sound of the record reflects its lyrics' sense of temporal dislocation. Even the most danceable numbers have a sluggish pace and somnolent tone, and lighter compositions, such as the drifting, semi-acoustic ""Timely"", suggest a state of permanent jet lag. Shaw's most effective tracks present epic, sweeping songs on a miniature scale, expressing the grandiose sentimentality of U2 or Arcade Fire without either's bombast, and with a far greater sense of implied intimacy. ""Stop Taking (So Many)"" is essentially an arena-rock ballad turned inside-out. The beat is rendered as a simple pulse, a handful of plaintive piano notes carry most of the piece's emotional weight, and the strum and noise of guitars are replaced with abstracted electronic hums, whirs, and beeps. ""Hey You Guys"", the opening track, is slightly more traditional in its gradual build towards catharsis, but even its most dramatic moments are underplayed, and its words are sung in a cool, aloof voice that recalls Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan at his most sedate. In these songs, Circlesquare achieve a rare, truly successful synthesis of rock dynamics and the aesthetics of minimalist electronica. Whereas most attempts to bridge the gap between these styles yield garden-variety rock songs in bleep-beep drag or vice versa, Shaw demonstrates a fluency in both genres that leaves his hybrid music feeling organic instead of dilletantish. He is somewhat less successful when he moves away from that stylistic intersection, resulting in the interminable, drowsy space folk of ""Music For Satellites"", or the appealing yet slightly too familiar slow-motion disco groove of ""Dancers"". Despite the fact that Songs About Dancing and Drugs is an exceptionally slow and languorous set of songs, Shaw's arrangements are consistently dynamic, albeit in rather subtle ways. Even the most ambient compositions on the record continuously add new rhythmic hooks and textures, and just when a song seems to drift out into deep space, he will toss in a surprising new element, as with the lonely trumpet solo that turns up at the end of ""Bombs Away, Away"". This approach is especially apparent in 13-minute finale ""All Live But the Ending"", which cycles through all of the album's primary moods and textures while essentially summarizing its lyrical content. Though everything that precedes ""All Live But the Ending"" is more or less an expression of elliptical ambivalence, Shaw lets the song build to a genuine emotional climax, complete with a digitally warped horn fanfare that shifts into a quiet, sober resolution in which he offers the album's one moment of total certainty in the form of a simple motto: ""In the end, after all, all that anybody really needs is art and music."" That line can be taken as the moral of the album, but even more to the point is that in its final seconds, after repeating his maxim a few times as if to emphatically underline it, Shaw invites the listener one last time to ""come along."" Ultimately, the album is about the value of participating in culture through the communal aspects of art and music, which is sort of ironic given that this is a record best suited to being heard alone, with a good set of headphones.","Jeremy Shaw and crew explore the communal aspects of art and music; ironically, it's best suited to being heard with a good set of headphones.

""To Some It Comes Easy"" might even trigger some to reach for the liners to check if they're hearing Kevin Drew on guitar and Emily Haines on vocals. Yet despite the fact that Vermue's a walking Six-Degrees-of-Canadian-Indie, he more than distinguishes himself on Jet Black. The first thing you'll notice is the tranquil, whispery vocal style that threads throughout the record, scarcely shifting from the crunchy T. Rexisms of ""Coastline"" to the wistful ""Rewind"", paired with only acoustic guitar. Black's axes are another of its distinguishing traits: There's plenty of color and variation, highlighted by production with an immaculate sense of space. The album's production and Vermue's economical, buttoned-down songwriting offer plenty of tonal and genre variation, but everything still feels like it's hitting the same mark. Vermue's paid his dues to get to this point-- he labored for a couple of albums and moved from tiny Guelph, Ontario, to much wider recognition in a Toronto's overcrowded indie network-- and Black's overriding sentiment reflects his creative drive, filtered through the shifting dictates of life within a scene. He constantly resists the urge to second-guess himself, as on ""To Some It Comes Easy"" (""Try to believe/ That I hit the right track/ And don't look back"") and ""You Can't Get It Back"" (But I don't waste time/ You can't get it back/ And there's no ownership line""). On the album's best song, the minimalist power-pop groover ""How We Exit"", he begins by admitting his capricious decision-making skills might be a bit off, but rectifies that problem quickly, trusting his gut and splitting. When he decides to stick around, as on the disco-tinged ""We're In a Thunderstorm"", Vermue makes the best use of his time, extolling the virtues of simply dressing yourself up and running around. Though his earnestness might come off as humorless, a quick glance at the contradictory messages contained within Jet Black's album cover alone suggest otherwise. The title pokes fun at Vermue's unique appearance and the preternatural smoothness of his voice, both of which were enough to land him a brief spot in Shortbus (he's not a Canadian, but add John Cameron Mitchell to that list in the first paragraph). In a recent interview, Vermue said of the title that he ""wanted something tough, muscular, and rock'n'roll. People think that's funny, knowing me."" That's the key to why Black is such an effective introduction to a wider audience: what looks, in a certain light, to be a top hat and tails, in another is a tuxedo t-shirt.","Toronto indie-rock scene vet crafts a very likable pop album for, you guessed it, Arts & Crafts.

Repo,Black Dice,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38a9d034d5c69bf2e4f/1:1/w_160/031ad087.jpg,2009-04-09 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12907-repo/,Paw Tracks,"It's still a stretch to talk about Black Dice as a formalist collective, but the Brooklyn band's migration from loose noise to something more structured counts as one of the most intriguing narratives in the art-rock underground. In the beginning, around the turn of 2000, Black Dice became notorious for playing antagonistic post-hardcore punk shows in dramatically darkened rooms. It was a badge of honor to have gotten hurt, or at least certifiably scared, during one of their lashing affairs, which rated as physical ordeals as much as aural experiences. Then, starting with their 2002 DFA album Beaches and Canyons, Black Dice repositioned themselves as an unusually gritty kind of ambient band. They took to standing stock-still behind tables of sequencers and effects, with occasional drumming the only thing to count as even remotely gestural. The change to stand-around gear happened around the same time as that of their compatriots in Animal Collective, but Black Dice's shift signified something different: hermetic, internal systems-like ideas, as opposed to Animal Collective's more external, ecstatic musings. Four albums and lots of heady grinding later, Repo draws on that same analytical zeal while also expanding a sound that's increasingly more realized and strategic. With its steady forward movement and messy pointillist pillars thrown up where concise beats might be, the opening ""Nite Crème"" marks Black Dice's slow, lurching move towards something like techno. It wouldn't tear up any Berlin warehouse, to be sure, but thinking about techno proves useful to Repo: Where lots of techno artists have moved away from austere formalism toward more liberated outbursts of noise (see Ricardo Villalobos, Audion, any producer who treats where beats fall as a means more than an end), Black Dice, as a band, have effectively moved in the opposite direction, toward a richly murky meeting ground somewhere in the middle. Much of Repo makes good on that same sort of bottom-up drift toward cohesion, whether rhythmic or not. ""Glazin"" plays similar sleight-of-hand with the calm pulse of reggae: As a sampled guitar clip gets infested with all kinds of anxiously granulated textures and whirs, a warm bass-line starts to roll contentedly beneath it. In ""Earnings Plus Interest"", a sampled drum break that could be sourced from 1980s hip-hop or 90s big-beat starts out splashy but then turns stoic, as clutches of noise crash all around it. Those patented Black Dice clutches of noise sound more specifically placed on Repo than they did on 2007's Load Blown, an album that seemed to prioritize textural smear more than simple rhythm or spacing. Repo is still abstract in a similar and smeary way, but it sounds like Black Dice have gotten a better handle on their gear-- as if, having learned how to make more and more different noises on more and more different machines, part of their project has turned more toward what exactly to do with those noises. In those terms, highlights like ""La Cucaracha"" and ""Lazy TV""-- with coolly stuttering use of a delay-glitch as quasi-African guitar and lots of warped DJ Screw drama, respectively-- qualify as compositions, however decomposed they prove.","The latest from this Brooklyn art-noise band continues their analytical zeal while also expanding a more realized sound.

Score! Twenty Years of Merge Records: The Covers,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38bea9e61561daa4cd8/1:1/w_160/7cfd1b07.jpg,2009-04-09 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12908-score-twenty-years-of-merge-records-the-covers/,Merge,"Merge Records doesn't look its age. Originally formed as an outlet for Superchunk material, the Durham, N.C.-based label has grown into an indie institution, but only gradually-- year by year, release by release. It never allied itself with a scene or a sound, so the mind doesn't automatically tether it to a specific place or time, the way Sub Pop, despite its strong roster this decade, will be most closely associated with Seattle in the late 1980s and early 90s. So it's hard to believe Merge is already 20 years old, an occasion the label is marking with a big birthday bash-- the five-day XX Merge fest in July-- and a subscription-only series of commemorative retrospectives and remixes. Perhaps the most intriguing party favor is Score! Twenty Years of Merge Records: The Covers, a choppy but oddly endearing compilation that enlists 20 non-Merge acts to cover Merge songs. Score! doesn't resemble a traditional label sampler as much as one of those carefully curated compilations like this year's Dark Was the Night. Both releases benefit charities, both feature the National at their most subdued, and both serve as a useful state-of-indie report. But where Dark emphasized ""primarily folkie tunefulness, baroque lines in which the guitar is subservient to other instruments"" (as Scott Plagenhoef wrote in his review), Score! allows and even encourages these artists to indulge every idiosyncrasy, no matter how potentially off-putting or digressive. The result is a weirder, less polite album, one that showcases a diversity of musical styles and seems much more representative of 2000s indie. More representative, however, doesn't mean better. This comp's inclusive cross-section comes with a downside: If there's something for everyone, there's also something for everyone to skip over. Ted Leo and the Pharmacists' workmanlike cover of Robert Pollard's ""The Numbered Head"" will likely get played often (at least those opening chords), as listeners move past the Hive Dwellers' discursive take on Superchunk's ""My Noise"", which pares the song down to scattered drum hits, a meandering melodica, stair-stepping bass, and floating vocals. It's interesting to hear the Merge founders stretched out like taffy, but it's interesting only once. Conor Oberst's earnestness gets the better of him on Bright Eyes' version of the Magnetic Fields' ""Papa Was a Rodeo"", which takes the song at face value and misses its meta-country-song ironies. Stephin Merritt demands a more complex approach with shades of feeling rather than primary colors, and unfortunately Jens Lekman and Tracey Thorn also learn that the hard way on ""Yeah! Oh, Yeah!"" communicating only sincere resignation to the neglect of lust, mischief, and desperation. Who'd have thought Merritt would prove so difficult to cover? And who'd have thought Chris Lopez would be so easy? He gets two testimonials here, one from the much-misses Rockateens and another from Tenement Halls. The New Pornographers streamline the Teens' ""Don't Destroy This Night"" and reinforce that central snaky riff, while the Shins put floaties on the Halls' ""Plenty Is Never Enough"", making its shuffle all the more buoyant. Similarly, East River Pipe gets a pair of songs: Okkervil River chop and screw ""All You Little Suckers"" to little effect, but the Mountain Goats make the otherwise humdrum ""Drug Life"" into a rotting-flesh acoustic lament, emphasizing the melody's similarities to Frankie Valli's ""Let's Hang On"" as a darkly ironic gesture. Of course Superchunk get the most covers-- four in total, all with varying degrees of success. After the Hive Dwellers, Death Cab for Cutie find new kicks in ""Kicked In"" thanks to a murkier, more emphatic sound that suits them well, and Ryan Adams preserves the drama of ""Like a Fool"", although it sounds like he could be covering Echo & the Bunnymen here. Best is Les Savy Fav's no-frills re-creation of ""Precision Auto"", which they rev into a frantic driving song. Fortunately, there's little reverence here for two songs that might be considered sacred cows. The Apples in Stereo turn Neutral Milk Hotel's ""King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. 3"" into a power-puff pop song, complete with yo-gabba melodies and adorable synths that inject a little light whimsy into Mangum's dark lyrics. And Times New Viking remake the Arcade Fire's ""Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)"" as a lo-fi dirge that's equal parts pisstake and affectionate reimagining. It's an ideal closer for a comp that, rather than simply showcasing the signees' songcraft, effectively settles Merge and its roster into the larger context of 20 years of indie rock, emphasizing the give-and-take between the label and the rest of the world. Just think what Merge will do when it reaches drinking age.","Merge continues its 20th anniversary festivities with a comp of non-label artists-- Bright Eyes, Shins, New Pornos-- covering songs from its catalog.

Fear Draws Misfortune,Cheer-Accident,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ecc0084474cd0c0162/1:1/w_160/20963f48.jpeg,2009-04-08 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12784-fear-draws-misfortune/,Cuneiform,"Cheer-Accident are the quintessential Chicago post-rock band that, sadly, you may have never heard of. Too bad. They've been exploring head-scratching, creatively fucked-up time signatures and sideways guitar shenanigans for 20 years now, leaving a pronounced influence on the Windy City's art-rock scene. Their playful musical approach is a ripe aesthetic of absurdist humor: Live shows are infamously strange and sometimes audience-provoking, featuring an assortment of Fluxus mind-fuckery. Over the years, band leader/multi-instrumentalist Thymme (pronounced ""Tim"") Jones has grown his band's adventurous sound from schizoid metallic post-rock (in the vein of scene brethren Rapeman, Shorty, or Don Caballero) to a higher-brow variety of avant-rock that covers ground as diverse as falsetto vocal vignettes, orchestral dissonant horn lines, Van Dyke Parks-ian rainy-day pop, cubist piano compositions, ambient cinematic excursions, noise collages, free-form freakouts, and every kind of noodle-y and angular guitar manifestation possible. Fittingly Jones has been involved with several side projects with Jim O'Rourke (Brice-Glase, Yona Kit). If 1997's Enduring the American Dream served as Cheer's first ambitious (and quite successful) synthesis of post-rock, krautrock, orchestral pop, and minimalist classical influences, their new Fear Draws Misfortune is the fuller realization of those initial experiments. Except that Fear is their unequivocal prog with a capital ""P"" record. Perhaps Thymme himself could better introduce the album: ""I'm talking time signatures, classical music references, I'm talking lots of keyboards... I'm talking five keyboards at once, I make Rick Wakeman look humble."" That encapsulation is a quote from a skit several year's back from Jones' long-running cable access show *""*Cool Clown Ground"" where he's been known to spend an entire 30-minute episode playing Scrabble with his friends, shaking maracas, or sitting around looking into the camera making sure that nothing much ever happens. Thankfully, Cheer-Accident's music is the antithesis, being in constant melodic and dynamic motion. I'm not sure how the writing process goes down. But considering how integral the fluid polyrhythmic krautrock-fawning drums are, as well as the meandering horn-lines and the crystalline, almost Jon Anderson-like lead vocals-- all handled by mathlete multi-instrumentalist Jones-- a comparison to French drummer/prog god, Christian Vander's Magma, is fitting. Much like Magma, Fear's cornucopia of interweaving keyboard lines and Fripp-ian six-string squiggles frequently ascend into cosmic-choral singing. When you mix the juiciest sounding bits from abacus-rockers like This Heat, Henry Cow, Magma, King Crimson, and Yes-- which this CD most definitely does-- you get a prog-rock geek's wet dream. A key influence is the guest appearance of Carla Kihlstedt of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum that adds a nice feminine flourish, frequently evoking her band's ever-shifting operatic creepiness.","Veteran Chicago post-rock outfit indulges its prog instincts, piling on the keyboards and busting out the crazy time signatures.

Telekinesis!,Telekinesis,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a367c0084474cd0c0276/1:1/w_160/0a72d66b.jpg,2009-04-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12882-telekinesis/,Merge,"Telekinesis' debut album announces its utility right away, filling your mind with ideas of how to put its songs in their most ideal contexts: car rides on sunny afternoons, summer-themed mix cds, cookouts, bumper music for teen dramas. It's like buying a new pair of sneakers and getting the urge to go for a run, even if you're not normally inclined to do such a thing-- the music creates a demand for its own use, and you start anticipating your first opportunity to hear it under perfect conditions. There is nothing original or novel about Telekinesis' music, but somewhat counterintuitively, its by-the-books professionalism is what makes it so effective. Every song on the record feels instantly familiar, with easygoing power-pop hooks casually triggering positive responses. The 31-minute album feels like a sustained moment of déjà vu, with music that  echoes feelings and sounds by the Shins, Fountains of Wayne, Sloan, Death Cab For Cutie, Superchunk, Matthew Sweet, and Teenage Fanclub without directly lifting from anyone in particular. Well, that is, with the exception of a guitar part on the mid-album highlight ""Imaginary Friend"" that clearly recalls Joey Santiago's shimmery lead on the Pixies classic ""Here Comes Your Man"", but that is hardly a complaint. As much as its songs can fit comfortably in the background, several tracks on Telekinesis! reward closer attention. ""Tokyo"", a perky rocker about having dreams so vivid they feel like actual memories, stands out as a prime example of songwriter Michael Benjamin Lerner's gift for conveying a feeling of relaxed urgency. ""Look to the East"" and ""All of a Sudden"" have a similar kind of carefree velocity, careening headlong in the direction of nowhere in particular. When he's not trading on momentum, Lerner is successful in writing cutesy nostalgic tunes like ""Awkward Kisser"", but stumbles slightly when he attempts acoustic balladry in the vein of Elliott Smith, as on the anticlimactic finale ""I Saw Lightning"" and the limp album-opener ""Rust"", neither of which flatter his strengths as a writer, and only serve to highlight his thin, nondescript singing voice. The softer bits are more powerful when they lead up to a power-chord catharsis, particularly in ""Coast of Carolina"", which seamlessly shifts from a lo-fi intro to a crisp radio-ready chorus. Even though their music is charming and enjoyable, Telekinesis! is ultimately a generic album, though that's not a slam. Think of it this way: If power-pop groups were pizza joints, bands like Weezer, Big Star, and the New Pornographers would be the world-famous, critically beloved restaurants with impeccable craft and unmistakable style, sorta like Frank Pepe's in New Haven, or Di Fara in the outer reaches of Brooklyn. Telekinesis, like many other good-but-not-great indie bands, are more like unpretentious neighborhood parlors that provide predictable but perfectly tasty slices with a minimum of fuss. They're certainly much, much better than what's on offer from the big corporate chains, and are often capable of delivering a product that is just as satisfying as their more upscale competitors.","This power-pop debut echoes the Shins, Fountains of Wayne, Sloan, and Teenage Fanclub without directly lifting from anyone in particular.

Baby Charles,Baby Charles,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b59d034d5c69bf2c72/1:1/w_160/f98be477.jpeg,2009-04-08 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12740-baby-charles/,Record Kicks,"Baby Charles are a contemporary British deep funk outfit, and from the evidence of their self-titled debut, it seems impossible to assume it was recorded anywhere other than 1970s New Orleans. The hazy thickness of the record feels like a fever dream of blaxploitation funk, the kind of sound your reptilian memory bank automatically associates with Quentin Tarantino soundtracks. There is nothing academic about any of this, however. Where many live funk groups see their best efforts wilted by a certain ""earnest conservatory student"" vibe, Baby Charles effortlessly summon the sort of unholy, sweat-in-uncomfortable-places funkiness you probably thought hadn't survived past 1978. A big part of this is due to their looseness. Baby Charles have an intuitive feel for the sweet spot of funk, pitched between the broad and the obsessively narrowed-down, and once they hit this magic pocket, they never stray far. Each groove is a monstrous, dopamine-flooding marvel, with peals of Hammond organ firing behind low, hard blues-guitar licks and a horn section unafraid to let things get a little messy. Dionne Charles' full-throated soul howl is what puts everything over the top-- her wail fits perfectly into the generous space the band clears out for it but never takes center stage. Nobody stands out too much or gets in anyone else's way, which means every single groove surges forward with pulverizing force. Indeed, sometimes things get so monolithic that Baby Charles starts to resemble a different kind of 70s record. ""Life's Begun"" is powered by a guitar riff that could be sent directly to Black Sabbath, Vol. 4, while the drummer works a circling battering ram of percussion that recalls ""Manic Depression"" as much as the Meters. Charles dispenses generic soul-mama wisdom-- ""Don't be keeping up with those Joneses,"" she warns-- but her growl is so hair-raising that words are rendered irrelevant. ""Coming From a Higher Place"" dispenses with lyrics entirely, opening a blasting, horn-and-flutes fanfare before segueing into a manic organ chug. This album begs to be sampled by enterprising hip-hop producers-- there are dozens of potential Just Blaze tracks here, for example-- and a big part of the fun is closing your eyes and imagining which rappers could flatten which beats. Wale high-stepping over ""Step On""! Bun B punishing the huge empty spaces on ""Life's Begun""! Nas brooding over the smoky ""This Time""! Baby Charles also cover the Arctic Monkeys' ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"", and they find an easy slinkiness in the groove that feels right for Alex Turner's sidelong, cutting observations. The fact that they also find room for a funky trombone solo and make it back to the chorus without getting lost is testament to their discipline and control, and is more proof that off of the strength of their first album, Baby Charles belong with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and precious few others in a discussion of modern funk bands that feel like something other than a pallid imitation.","Soul revivalists from Brighton, England, manage a loose and funky vibe so palpable you can't believe their debut wasn't recorded in the 1970s.

The Last Laugh,Joker's Daughter,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3559d034d5c69bf2dc9/1:1/w_160/9fa51621.jpg,2009-04-08 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12868-the-last-laugh/,Team Love,"The origins of Joker's Daughter almost sound apocryphal. In 2003, London-born, Greek-descended folkie Helena Costas struck up a transatlantic correspondence with New York-based beat-sculptor Danger Mouse-- well before The Grey Album made him internet-famous and ""Crazy"" cemented his reputation as a producer with a deep knowledge of pop's usable past. They planned to collaborate eventually, and six years later, they finally have: The Last Laugh, another hyped project for him but a debut for her-- is their first album under the Joker's Daughter moniker, which is based on one of Costas' many revolving stage names. Costas and Danger Mouse are, to say the least, an unlikely pair. They inhabit vastly different realms, the rift between which gapes wider than the Atlantic. Danger Mouse is a studio musician, his music created indoors, while Costas' music sounds so bucolic as to be almost pagan. A few years ago, we might have labeled her freak folk, but that designation seems meaningless these days and misleading in her case. Comparisons to Joanna Newsom and Marissa Nadler will be inevitable, but Costas places herself squarely in the British folk tradition, harking back to Fotheringay, Pentangle, Vashti Bunyan, and Fairport Convention at their most folk and least rock. It's no small wonder that she would write about talking owls or King Arthur appearing to her during a walk in the country. Her world appears too caught up in the past to make room for contemporary beats and techniques, while Mouse doesn't seem the type to truck with odes to smiling dragonflies. And yet, the unlikelihood of their collaboration makes The Last Laugh at the very least a curio: Don't you want to know how these two sound together? They sound like a spacey pastoral, a shroom trip along Hadrian's Wall. With contributions ranging from subliminal to unmistakable, Danger Mouse makes Costas' beatific folk sound even more beatific, more folksy-- kaleidoscopic, storybookish-- while she gives him a whimsical framework on which to hang his samples, beats, and synths. For Costas, this is a walk along familiar glens; for Danger Mouse, it's a sojourn to the exotic countryside. Rather than infuse her songs with his own signature sounds, he approaches the project less like a producer and more like a backing band. Nevertheless, he gets to cut loose a little more here than he did on higher-profile collaborations with the Black Keys and Beck. His playful production defines the instrumental ""Chasing Ticking Crocodile"" and the bouncy ""The Bull Bites Back"" almost completely, but to ""JD Folk Blues"" he adds only a subtle thudding bass and a rambling keys solo to make it sound both Bryter-er and Layter-er. The title track burbles with ominous synth cascades and racing sitar riffs, while squelchy beats drive stand-out ""Lucid"", reinforcing Costas' lilting melody and excitable chorus. Opener ""Worm's Head"" gets what sounds like a live band (including Neutral Milk Hotel bass player Scott Spillane), ""Jelly Belly"" is fitted with a jaunty carnival-reggae beat that almost OD's on Ren Fest, and ""The Running Goblin"" treads on an oompah bass line and a nervously whistled theme. In general, there's more Costas on The Last Laugh than Danger Mouse, and she proves a charming guide along these crags and gullies. Her voice, airy and textured, ranges from whispery intimations to impish collusions, although her lyrics, which are capable of impressive wordplay, too often threaten to oversell the fantastical imagery. ""Where has July gone?"" she asks on ""Cake and July"". ""Is it under my pillow?"" And yet, such fancies, though perhaps too tweedily twee on their own, make Danger Mouse's contributions all the more fitting-- not only demanding the animation of his production, but providing a whimsical contrast to his exacting techniques. As the Joker's Daughter, Costas and Mouse are interested in marrying organic and synthetic sounds, not in contrasting them. The resulting album may be steeped in British folk history, yet the pair still finds room to play around with those sounds and traditions. The result is a sparkling debut for her and one of his most interesting collaborations.","A long-simmering project between producer Danger Mouse and London-born, Greek-descended folkie Helena Costas finally gets its Team Love release.

Begone Dull Care,Junior Boys,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37a13d1975652138ace/1:1/w_160/6d624a1f.jpg,2009-04-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12896-begone-dull-care/,Domino,"Five years ago, Junior Boys-- Canadians with an eye on London's turn-of-the-millennium dancefloor innovations-- merged UK garage's sugary micro-programming with winsome synth-pop hooks and melancholy vocals on their debut album, Last Exit. The record made electronically attuned critics gush, but unlike a lot of supposed crossovers, you could also imagine the Boys reaching a wider indie audience: Frontman/mastermind Jeremy Greenspan and then-partner Johnny Dark learned well from their white-label heroes, while Greenspan's voice oozed a familiar strain of bedridden heartbreak. Yet Greenspan hesitantly distanced himself from comparisons to indie heartthrobs-- perhaps that's one reason why Last Exit failed to find the mass collegiate audience that turned the Postal Service into the 21st-century's indie-pop/electronic hybrid of choice. Junior Boys' sophomore LP, So This Is Goodbye, dropped two years later with a more traditional sound rooted in classy 1980s electro-funk, trading Last Exit's pinprick jolts of joy for the languid sadness of guys in sharp suits. Commercially, it seems to have been a canny move; a Carl Craig remix of ""Like a Child"" even brought an improbable Grammy nod. While So This Is Goodbye hardly troubled the Billboard Hot 100, it (deservedly) received some of the attention denied the acclaimed but under-heard Last Exit. Listening to the new Begone Dull Care, it seems the more straightforward synthetic soul of So This Is Goodbye will remain the Boys' template for the foreseeable future. Lush, sometimes to the point of textural overload, Begone is audibly the work of band that's now been honing its chops for a decade. Whatever its budget, the album definitely sounds like the product of million-dollar multi-tracking. That's helpful when you're referencing an era where even cheap keyboards could put a dent in the fattest bankroll. And listeners might also need to cash-in their pocket change for some swank studio gear if they want to fully enjoy Greenspan and partner Matt Didemus' delicately fussed-over handclaps and scissored vox and lugubrious call-and-response synths. That's not to totally discount the duo's talent as tunesmiths-- even if ""Hazel"" is the only thing here that might survive being thrown to the wolves of pop radio-- but sometimes Greenspan and Didemus' attention to detail is the only thing that redeems the album's occasionally sketchy songwriting. At Begone's weakest, the tracks could be easily dismissed as slickly assembled bouts of pre- and post-rave deja vu. The Tangerine-ian arpeggiated bass-synth pattern on ""Work"" is played-out, almost shtick-y, though the bell-like melody adds an eerie touch. But this slightly unexpected nod to old-school bleep techno bleakness, and Greenspan's latest turn as breathy dude-diva, isn't quite enough to sell a six-minute song to anyone but über-fans or audiophiles. Since I'm not much of an audiophile, but did consider myself an über-fan, I kept waiting for ""Work"" (and several other songs) to punch something other than my nostalgia switch. In vain, as it turned out. So what's Begone's draw, especially for those of us who fell in love with the affecting future-funk experiments of the Boys' early work? Well as mentioned above, it is hard not to marvel at how assured the Boys have grown as producers. The album's best tunes, like ""Bits and Pieces"", retain the mix of ennui and ebullience that marked early singles like ""Birthday"", but with minimalist restraint traded for so many perfectly placed period touches that you may have trouble picking out your favorite bit: Maybe it's the little glitch-hiccup breakdown? Or the saxophone that slides in mid-track from soft-rock central casting? If Begone is repeat-play worthy, and I'd argue it is, it might be down to the Boys' ever-growing skill as arrangers. (""Bits and Pieces"" combines maybe a dozen compositional elements without coming off like a claustrophobic cut-and-paste exercise.) And they're not averse to the occasional sonic curveball. (Is that a banjo on the whimsical ""Dull To Pause""?) Plus for all my grousing, it's hard to deny that the album's high-gloss shine can occasionally be seductive in its own right, at least if you've got love for a certain brand of glitz. Which leads to my nagging worry about the trajectory the Boys seem to be following. The weaker tunes on Last Exit were carried by the incongruity of their component parts; you overlooked an undercooked melody, say, because the band had come up with such a compelling and unexpected hybrid. As Greenspan and Didemus have settled into a classicist groove, they're running a risk well-known to their mid-80s influences. It was a short trip from well-produced woe into camp sterility, and well-regarded uptown aesthetes like the Blue Nile were always only a mixing board misstep from guys peddling digitized woodwinds for cocktail loungers. So when I call Begone Dull Care a ""mature"" album, know it skirts both the positive and negative connotations of one of the most divisive adjectives in pop's lexicon.","Continuing the straightforward synthetic soul of So This Is Goodbye, Junior Boys' third LP is lush-- sometimes to the point of textural overload.

Join the Q,The Qemists,by: Nate Patrin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36b13d1975652138aae/1:1/w_160/deff99b0.jpg,2009-04-07 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12885-join-the-q/,Ninja Tune,"For reasons that have since escaped me, I remember being briefly entertained by the Qemists' single ""Stompbox"" when it came out in 2007. It's probably because the time and place might have been just about right for a shamelessly boneheaded fusion of vaguely punkish metallic-type rock and something that you could probably call drum'n'bass without looking entirely misguided. I may have also been drunk, if that helps. In any case, it was a little get-stupid diversion that seemed fun enough to file away for future reference, to be occasionally exhumed by the odd off-road racing video game. If it's a little dumb, eh, what's the harm? But oh man, Join the Q is so, so dumb. I don't mean dumb as snob shorthand for ""catchy, simple, and arena-sized,"" which the Qemists are sort of shooting for and graze enough to draw blood. No, I mean the kind of dumb that results in a bunch of musicians striking on an idea with bright but limited shelf life, overextending that idea, and forgetting to practice a second one. The Qemists follow the hallowed decade-plus-long tradition of post-""Firestarter"" bandwagoneers coming up with a lowest-common-denominator notion of, to use one of the 1990s' goofiest subgenre names, ""rocktronica."" In this case, it's a flailing, smothering mutation of jungle that doesn't trust the drums enough to haul all the momentum and feels obliged to drown it in layers of guitars and guitar-substitute distortion. And they only have one setting on their dial-- the one that makes the boorish, bellowing mook jungle of Pendulum sound as nuanced and reserved as Photek. The Qemists are, at their roots, a rock band-- at least, that's how they started. And while they spent time moonlighting as drum'n'bass DJs after discovering the genre sometime in its waning post-Saturnz Return years, they seem to have missed something in translation: they heard 140 BPM but apparently focused more on the PM than the B. The great thing about classic jungle is that it took the dense elasticity of breaks like ""Amen My Brother"" and ""Funky Drummer"" and found countless ways to play around with their structures. The Qemists are more in love with the idea of the riff, so the rhythms on Join the Q have the blunt-force, blind-charging momentum of a drumbeat that's more interested in getting people to mosh instead of dance. And they're short on variety: ""S.W.A.G."" uses a near-identical drum pattern as ""Stompbox"". So does ""Drop Audio""; so does ""When Ur Lonely""; so does ""On the Run""; so does ""The Perfect High"". There-- that's more than half the album. Take away the ""tense moment"" cue from a bad CGI-riddled action film that serves as the intro to ""S.W.A.G."" and an irritating 95-second beatbox routine (""Soundface"", featuring someone named Beardyman), and that's just about two-thirds. The fact that they switch things up a little for the other third would be a bit more encouraging if it wasn't so clear the Qemists are out of their comfort zone. They do manage to plow through a dippy mock-up of some of Nine Inch Nails' more recent stuff on the Mike Patton-featuring ""Lost Weekend"", at least for the minute and a half until they give up and go back to that one security blanket rhythm of theirs (so I guess we're up to 3/4 now). But what they put Wiley through on the cod-dancehall ""Dem Na Like Me"" is a damn shame-- he sounds awkward and stilted when he's not being drowned out, the exact opposite of his comfortably-flowing club-friendly advancement in ""Wearing My Rolex"". ""Got One Life"" is at least somewhat tolerable, thanks largely to a nice ragga-pop vocal from MC Navigator and a rhythm that doesn't come at you all full-throttle in your face Xtreem Cool Ranch Doritos and shit-- mostly because it sounds kind of like electro-house. (Funny that the one full-length track on Join the Q that isn't irredeemable resembles a less-adventurous version of a Justice outtake.) The rest is hyperactive brah-jungle that runs on Red Bull instead of Red Stripe, a headache conduit that sees rhythm as just a cheap, rudimentary delivery vector for joyless guitar bludgeonings. Familiar with ""buttrock""? Here's butt'n'bass.","The Qemists follow the tradition of post-""Firestarter"" bandwagoneers coming up with a lowest-common-denominator notion of, ugh, ""rocktronica.""

Ritual and Education / From an Ancient Star,Belbury Poly,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2cb9d034d5c69bf2ca2/1:1/w_160/fe68ac47.gif,2009-04-07 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12759-ritual-and-education-from-an-ancient-star/,Ghost Box,"The London label Ghost Box has released bookish, odd psychedelia for nearly five years now-- long enough that they deserve a compilation like Ritual and Education to collect the cream of it. It's taut, sensitively sequenced, and priced cheap-- about $7.50--as a download-only release; perfect for newcomers, dabblers, and people too cheap to order records from the UK. Ghost Box's music is psychedelic because it takes musical forms only monks have escaped-- ad jingles, health-class film soundtracks-- and makes them sound imbalanced, smeared, disjointed. Vocal samples fried by vinyl popping drift across backdrops of 1970s-sounding synthesizers; rhythms stutter in and out of patterns; perfectly nice moments are always ruined. Ritual and Education's rightest moments, then, are quietly wrong. The soft-focus soul of the Advisory Circle's ""Sundial"" or ""Mogadon Coffee Morning"" bypasses sex for nausea; the sample-based confetti of the Focus Group's ""Hey Let Loose Your Love"" sounds like the work of full-bore studio hacks who can't hear each other; and Belbury Poly makes muzak, an inherently anonymous style, sound eerily personal. I mostly listen at night because it upsets company. When dealing with music as transportive as Ghost Box's, a reliable measure of when it goes bad is when you're acutely aware of it. From an Ancient Star, Jim Jupp's latest as Belbury Poly, has moments like that-- where the spell of the music not only lifts, but dissolves. Jupp makes music in a narrow niche, so at best-- the fake-reggae of ""A Great Day Out"" or the anal-retentive court music of ""Adventure in a Miniature Landscape""-- he exercises his strengths and test-rides a few new genres. At worst, he imitates novelty synthesizer music so expertly that it's indistinguishable from the real, harmless, ignorable thing. His last two albums, The Willows and The Owl's Map, were great. From an Ancient Star feels more concerned with form than vibes-- with education over ritual. Ghost Box is a label pulling a specific thread of musical history, but that's not what makes them interesting; what makes them interesting is their ability to reanimate and manipulate that history where less imaginative artists might slave to it. The composer David Behrman once said, ""The world is filled with busy, noisy music-- and noise in general-- and I'd rather contribute to the quieter end of the spectrum."" It's a quote I've always loved because it reminds me that experimental, psychedelic records don't have to announce themselves like assholes. They can feel weird without being abrasive, and hushed without being passive or overly beautiful. They can feel-- like Ritual and Education does-- like the work of nerds and hermits, not provocateurs and stoners. In an age when most listeners probably have no idea what label their favorite new record came out on, Ghost Box has a unified, unmistakable vision. Each release appears as part of a whole. Their covers look the same. The liner notes are in the same style. Ghost Box isn't a label; it's a tiny planet. They print newsletters. And that's wonderful. Wave to them.","The London label Ghost Box compiles some of its askew psychedelica, plus the new album from one of its top artists, Belbury Poly.

Watersports,Mi Ami,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a332ea9e61561daa4c14/1:1/w_160/a4031480.jpg,2009-04-07 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12840-watersports/,Quarterstick,"For a few minutes early in 2003, D.C. clatterers Black Eyes were basically the best band in the world. They fed the sharp-shock Rapture dance-punk of the day through about 50 layers of organically grimy Dischord history, ending up with a whirling sort of catharsis that was as fun as it was heavy. The band's personnel went like this: two drummers, two bassists, and one dude who made dying-pterodactyl squawks while thrashing out tinny, spidery almost-funk guitar riffs and doing everything he could to disrupt the thundering groove exploding all around him. Black Eyes' live shows were dank basement dance parties for the ages: furious, immediate, jarring, sweaty as all hell. And then the band recorded Cough, their half-assed dub experiment of a second album, and suddenly ended. They were, after all, a D.C. band, and that's what D.C. bands do. Black Eyes bassist Jacob Long and squawker/guitarist Daniel Martin-McCormick make up two thirds of the San Francisco trio Mi Ami, whose existence makes me not miss Black Eyes so badly anymore. Their debut album, Watersports, takes the skritchety tumble of Black Eyes and stretches it out into something psychedelic, near-infinite. Watersports is seven songs long, and it lasts 47 minutes. Their beats don't rattle; they push and flicker and fade. Watersports is like the self-titled Black Eyes album calmed down and zoned out, the attempted dub of Cough fully developed and realized. The songs don't have verses or choruses; they're endless, mesmeric builds that flare up and then cool out again. Even at their noisiest, they maintain their mantra-like repetition. Part of the secret is in the recording itself. Watersports sounds terrific. A couple of pre-album 12"" singles captured a similar sound, but the bass was too thin, the drums too muffled. Here, the bass is thick and supple, echoing and ringing and never losing its footing. Long's bass makes the real rhythmic bed here; Damon Palermo's drums color spaces around that metronomic bubble as often as they keep time. Martin-McCormick's voice, which could be downright annoying even when Black Eyes were at their best, still works as an agent of rupture. But even he has cooled out a bit, muttering deep in the mix rather than yowling overtop of it. His lyrics, on the rare occasions when I can understand them, seem to turn Watersports into a disco album about being trapped inside your own skull; other people are ""only the echo of my mind."" On his guitar, he plays Morse-code pings, letting them fall over the tracks like rain as often as it slashes through them. The album comes sequenced almost like a DJ set; grooves maintain across tracks, and sometimes you don't notice immediately when one song dissolves into another. That reverb-y stretched-out quality is Mi Ami's greatest strength, one I hope they keep pushing on whatever records they do next. But you've probably already noticed that I can't help comparing this band to Black Eyes. This isn't really Mi Ami's fault, but Black Eyes were just too good, and wishing Mi Ami sounded just like them is as inevitable as wishing ""30 Rock"" was even more like ""Arrested Development"". The two ex-Black Eyes dudes in Mi Ami have some powerful magic working here, but they had even more when they just couldn't contain themselves.","Two former members of D.C. clatterers Black Eyes head out to San Francisco and regroup for a satisfying album of dubby and spaced-out post-punk.

Trailer Park: Legacy Edition,Beth Orton,by: Eric Harvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37dea9e61561daa4cb1/1:1/w_160/412c2598.jpg,2009-04-07 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12898-trailer-park-legacy-edition/,LegacyLegacy,"Believe it or not, Beth Orton originally wanted to name this album Winnebago, but of course, rights issues quickly squashed that idea. The title she ended up with, she remarked in a 1996 interview, ended up working just as well: ""Trailer Park conjures up the same kind of filmic American images, images of transience and dislocation... and funnily enough, when we shot the video for the first single (in an actual trailer park)... I had all these odd, rather desperate people coming up and giving me their entire life-stories in a second. Even though I didn't want them to."" That image of Orton-- pitched as a new brand of British folkie-- shooing away actual ""folk"" while frou-frouing up their surroundings to sell to upmarket downtempo audiences, is a good one to accompany Trailer Park. Certainly much more appropriate than the cover image they decided on: Orton in Chucks, for some reason plopped down in a parking lot. The disconnect between how Beth Orton was pitched to us and the way her music actually sounded was as vast as the barren landscape she fetishized. Instead of a lonesome troubadour traversing the desolate American West from carpark to carpark, Orton was a Norwich-born theatre chick who found herself in the midst of a rapidly-changing mid-90s UK pop scene. William Orbit spotted her in a theatre production and tabbed her to lend her plush, lonesome vocals to the opening track of the third iteration of his Strange Cargo series in 1993 (he'd also produce the since-disowned Japanese-only Superpinkymandy, technically her solo debut). From there, Orton fell in with an even higher-profile crowd: After closing out the Chemical Brothers' game-changing 1995 debut on ""Alive Alone"", she was scooped up by Tom and Ed's buddy Jeff Barrett, and his Heavenly imprint (at the time, most known for Saint Etienne and Manic Street Preachers) set about casting Orton in her first starring role. While so many of the supporting cast has faded from immediate memory, Trailer Park holds up surprisingly well, and the remastered tracks still reward headphone scrutiny. Even more than a decade later, ""She Cries Your Name"" still sounds great, with Orbit's luxuriously gloomy string arrangement-- especially the way the cello's low-end signals the entrance of the chorus like stage curtains parting-- and the deft production hands of UK electronic scenester Andrew Weatherall and Bad Seeds' Victor Van Vugt providing the perfect context for Orton's cozy, impressionistic Americana sketches. Twelve or so years after I dismissed it as resolutely Lilithy I'm struck at how Orton's vocals on several of these tracks are much less Sarah McLachlan  than Zombies' Colin Blunstone, and how the best moments of Trailer Park find a similar middle-ground between spooky and reassuring. Another surprise: the trip-hop rip-offs hold up the best here, and reward the remaster the most. Granted, ""Tangent"" and ""Touch Me With Your Love"" wouldn't exist without Massive Attack and Portishead, and Orton's vocals are nowhere near the level of Shara Nelson or Beth Gibbons, but that wasn't the point, either. Those basslines and atmospherics (and ""Touch Me""s spoken-word) are jazz club and coffee-shop, not Jamaican dub or hip-hop, and Orton wasn't only safe from harm, harm isn't even a consideration here-- she's on her way home, she's having short and happy dreams. ""Galaxy of Emptiness"" is still over 10 minutes long, and still hopelessly romantic, and it still sounds as good in the background during dinner as it does on headphones after a few glasses of wine. Save the spliffs for Dummy and Blue Lines. But how great would it have been if ""I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine"", Orton's cover of the Ronettes' wonderful, Spector-produced original, would have seen the same sort of space-jazz reimagining, instead of the folky evisceration it got on Trailer Park? As much as the promotional campaign wanted to pitch Orton as a hollow-box singer-songwriter, ""Sunshine"", ""Don't Need a Reason"", and the James Taylor-esque ""Whenever"" remain the most generic and skippable tracks. Her Natalie Merchant side, however, retains its rewards in ""Sugar Boy"", ""Live as You Dream"", and the adorable ""Someone's Daughter"". Putting nostalgia aside, the main question to ask of the ""Legacy Edition"" of Trailer Park, as with any re-release, is why? Aside from the obvious ""the CD industry is dying quickly, let's squeeze every last drop out of it,"" do you need the original, nine B-sides and a three-song 1997 EP (all for around $22)? If my instincts are correct, anyone who's read this far has still got the first version-- maybe it's packed away somewhere, maybe it's hidden on purpose-- or at least selected tracks compiled on random mixtapes. At least for an afternoon, especially while the spring is springing, save your cash and spend some time with the original artifacts. It just might surprise you, too.","The UK folkie's Wiliam Orbit-produced LP gets the remastered, reissued, and expanded treatment, and it turns out to be a pleasant surprise.

A Positive Rage,The Hold Steady,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a379b1335d7bf1698736/1:1/w_160/2faf4dcb,2009-04-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12895-a-positive-rage/,Vagrant,"At every Hold Steady show, singer Craig Finn has a line he slips in somewhere: ""There is so much joy in what we do here."" He's been saying this for years, but it took the band a while before that joy was being communicated to large audience and being reciprocated. Despite two wordy and whip-smart records, the band didn't fully hit its stride as performers until recent years. Around the time Finn started writing more choruses and singing more often than speaking his way through his songs, the rest of the Hold Steady became a live force as well, and the boozy, redemptive joy Finn was always going on about became not only believable but downright infectious. Weirdly, however, that infectiousness is a hard thing to document-- recorded on Halloween night 2007 at Chicago's Metro, live album A Positive Rage feels like a blurry Polaroid, a flat reminder of what was probably a pretty good time. Granted, very few live records even get that far. The record captures the band on both a victory lap for 2006's Boys and Girls in America and as it takes an opportunity to road-test material from an album that wouldn't be out until the following summer-- an exciting night for hardcore fans, who'd managed to fill the place two nights in a row. But the linchpins of a typical Hold Steady set, the fist-pumpers and drink-lifters, won't be converting anyone on this recording. Guitar-heavy highlights like ""Stuck Between Stations"", ""The Swish"", or ""Chips Ahoy"" rush past the ears in a Doppler-like whoosh. The setlist for this Halloween night show is a saving grace for the record. It's good to hear rarities like ""You Gotta Dance (With Who You Came With)"" or ""Girls Like Status"", as well as ""Ask Her For Adderall"", a hidden Stay Positive track that eclipses most of the rest of that record. It's even better to hear deep cuts like ""Same Kooks"" or ""Barfruit Blues"". It's here that the band can stretch out, the rhythm section can assert themselves a bit more, and some of the spontaneity of a live show is more evident. When Finn gets around to the second verse of ""Barfruit Blues"", he's alternating between hoarse shouting and a girly falsetto before the barroom piano riff barrels in. He even injects some excitement into the somber ""Citrus"": When he sings about citrus and liquor ""coming together"" for the second time, he slips into an almost uncomfortably lusty roar. There's at least a few moments here where you can hear how much the band was enjoying themselves. Even as a fan-targeted release, there are opportunities missed in making this a more considerate package. The liner notes consist of contact sheet-style photos and a journal-like tour summary from Finn, while the accompanying DVD seems more like a video résumé than a supplement to the record. While there are a few full-song performances (including ""Chips Ahoy"" from an earlier performance at Metro), it's mostly cobbled together from crowd testimonials, interview clips, and the band offering weak platitudes in between talking sold-out shows and digital sales. Guitarist Tad Kubler gets interviewed about the band's live presence, saying, ""If we can get someone in front of us, it's a done deal."" The Hold Steady are taking the success they chart here and asserting themselves a must-see live act, for any audience. More power to them-- but A Positive Rage isn't much of an opening gambit. It's a memento for the fans, for better or for worse. But if you were too loaded on Halloween 2007 to remember much from this show, maybe this is the album for you.","One of the best live bands on the planet offers a live CD/DVD package recording during its late-2007 Boys and Girls in America victory lap.

Inside Your Guitar,It Hugs Back,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3725e6ef95969320652/1:1/w_160/728bd837.jpg,2009-04-06 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12892-inside-your-guitar/,4AD,"At first blush, It Hugs Back seems like an awful name for a band, but upon hearing their debut album, it makes some sense. The group specialize in warm, gentle songs that return a listener's affection, but do not go much further-- their music is like a reassuring embrace, but it never feels like an equivalent to kissing, or anything remotely sexual. Cuddling is out of the question too, as the record's overwhelmingly melancholy tone suggests consolation rather than romantic bliss. Inside Your Guitar runs a gamut of shoegazer and dream pop styles. The group add nothing new to pre-existing genres, but are successful in customizing familiar sounds to suit their taste for clean tones and an abundance of negative space. For example, the relatively upbeat ""Work Day"" comes across like a My Bloody Valentine song remodeled as a crisp, immaculate Phoenix track, and the lovely ""Forgotten Song"" sounds like an exaggeratedly ethereal version of Iron & Wine. In other cases, the quartet hew closer to their most obvious influences. The organ-centric songs borrow the muted buzz of Electrelane and early Stereolab, and about half of the album in some way recalls the particular balance of drone, delicate melody, and catharsis found on Yo La Tengo's mid-90s albums Painful and Electr-o-pura. It Hugs Back may be lacking in terms of originality, but their craft and skill is hard to deny. Even when it seems as though they are just writing Designer Imposters versions of Yo La Tengo and Electrelane songs, the results tend to measure up favorably in comparison to many actual Yo La Tengo and Electrelane recordings. Guitarist Matthew Simms is particularly gifted, most especially when he steps away from standard indie rock strumming and focuses on simple, elegantly constructed lead melodies that ring out in the near-silence of slow, ambient tracks such as ""Q"" and ""Soon"". The up-tempo numbers keep the album from feeling flat and monochromatic, but Simms' murmured vocals keep them from lifting off, dragging assertive rhythms down into a self-conscious passivity. That sort of tension has the potential to be very evocative and moving, but Simms' persona is too nondescript to make it work. Whereas Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley both possess distinct voices that lend character, subtext, and concrete detail to their low key vocal performances, Simms just sounds blank and faceless, and this makes it much more difficult to connect with his music on a personal level. When Hubley quietly sings a song like ""Nowhere Near"", it feels as though we are being drawn into the mysterious inner world of a specific human being. There is nothing so powerful on Inside Your Guitar. Even when It Hugs Back seem to hold us close, the intimacy in their music seems hollow, impersonal, and anonymous.","As its name suggests, this group specializes in warm, gentle songs that return a listener's affection.

Scramble,The Coathangers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36db1335d7bf1698719/1:1/w_160/8dea17d0.jpg,2009-04-06 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12887-scramble/,Suicide Squeeze,"If the only good reason to overturn apple carts is for the fun of it, how 'bout them apples? Like Athens' Pylon before them, all-grrl Atlanta quartet the Coathangers are making sure the revolution will not be such a drag. On a rough 'n' rowdy self-titled 2007 debut via local label Rob's House Records, they swapped ""Suck My Left One"" for ""Nestle in My Boobies"", ""Oh Bondage, Up Yours!"" for ""Shut the Fuck Up"", hating Margaret Thatcher for sympathizing with ""Tonya Harding"". Word is their ramshackle live shows-- alongside the likes of Deerhunter, Black Lips, Jay Reatard, and, next month, Calvin Johnson-- have included loogies and My Little Pony.  Cue the premature backlash. The Coathangers keep the back-alley post-punk party going strong on a scratchy, shrieky, foul-mouthed sophomore album, Scramble, their first for Seattle-based Suicide Squeeze. The call-and-response vocals-- split between guitarist Julia Kugel, drummer Stephanie Luke, keyboard player Candice Jones, and Meredith Franco on bass-- are shrill. The politics aren't, even though technically everything-- from their beyond Fucked Up name to their overall fuck-you we're-not-the-Donnas stance-- is kind of political. Nope, the Coathangers aren't ones to let good intentions stand in for a good time. As with fellow Georgians the B-52s, their best songs play like should-be novelty hits. The Coathanger with the chirpy Snow White voice sings lead on a couple of the catchiest, including upstairs-neighbor rant ""Stop Stomp Stompin'"" and unrequited-love-at-first-sight song ""143"", both of which have enough quotidian sloganeering and goofy-but-true detail for UK shouters Art Brut. Pretty sure it's the same band member who threatens to break our ""fucking face"" on caterwauling garage-rocker ""Gettin' Mad and Pumpin' Iron"", too. But the Coathangers can also drop the tempo-- slow dancing with a dude who ""ain't no sissy"" on ""Dreamboat"", or missing a boy from outer space on keyboard-driven ""Sonic You"". There's even one for the olds: ""Arthritis Sux"". There's even one for tUne-YarDs: sloppy sound-effect collage ""Bobby Knows Best"". Put together enough novelty hits, and you have a pretty solid album. If off-kilter percussion can't quite overcome the whispery false ending on ""Pussywillow"", or ""Time Passing"" gets a little lost up its own indecipherable sci-fi squall, there's always the scuzzy pink frost of ""Toomerhead"" (he ain't an asshole, he's just sick), or the get-off-my-back hoarseness of ""Bury Me"". Particularly given the neanderthal sexual politics of much of the current indie music scene-- looking at you, Brooklyn Vegan comments section-- it's good politics when a girl group can declare, as a deeper-voiced Coathanger does on ""Cheap Cheap"", ""You can just go fuck yourself."" It's good entertainment when they can make us pretend they're not talking to us-- and that's probably smarter politics, too. As the Long Blondes once sang, you could have both.","Suicide Squeeze's politcally aware, all-grrl Atlanta quartet are making sure the revolution will not be such a drag.

Local Customs: Downriver Revival,Various Artists,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30e5e6ef9596932056e/1:1/w_160/4aa0b37f.jpg,2009-04-06 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12812-local-customs-downriver-revival/,Numero Group,"Despite all the superlatives lobbed at the Numero Group's catalog, the descriptions that really stick often come from the reissue label's own liner notes. Along with the warm patina of age emanating from re-mastered recordings and the cracked, yellowing photographs, these narratives are prime examples of music anthropology, thick with details that amplify each song's impact. The label exceeds its own storytelling standards with Local Customs: Downriver Revival, a collection of music recorded at Double U Sound, a rec room turned recording studio in suburban Detroit. The 24-track guided tour through Double U's history is paired with a detailed multimedia DVD that includes a 30-minute documentary and an interactive sound vault with over 200 extra tracks, arranged by individual boxes of tape. It not only makes most bonus DVDs look like cheap wastes of plastic and time, it lets listeners virtually walk into the lost basement studio in Ecorse, Mich., and view some of the people and places that seeped into Double U's reels of tape. Proprietor Felton Williams, an unassuming Ford Motor Company electrician and member of the Church of the Living God, managed to piece together a truly DIY studio operation. While the self-taught electrical whiz's longed-for hit factory never materialized, his dedication and open-door policy unwittingly turned Double U and its small stable of labels, mostly active from 1967 to 1981, into a local music time capsule. Williams' church connections and devotion to gospel weren't uncommon, but the variety of sacred music he recorded stands out. Toledo, Ohio, singer and fellow congregant Shirley Ann Lee's sweet, somber voice graces ""There's a Light"", which tests the fidelity of Felton's setup, and ""Please Accept My Prayer"", a bluesy end-of-service ode to the Lord. Mother-daughter duo the Coleman Family drop some rambling, back porch Appalachia-infected tunes and the Apostles of Music deliver a showy, funked-up version of ""Wade in the Water"". Some of the most peculiar songs, including Calvin Cooke's ""What Happens to People"", incorporate Church of the Living God's unique infatuation with the sitar and pedal steel guitar, producing an odd, wobbly twang. Equally intriguing secular sounds, ranging from sunny vocal harmonies to funk workouts, also blasted out of Williams' basement, like the Organics' Hammond-flavored instrumental ""Foot Stumpin'"". The true outlier of the bunch is ""Running Mod""-- with the Quadrophenia-appropriate chorus ""You can't catch a running mod""-- by Young Generation, a cut-rate local garage band fronted by black singer Alan Crowell. But the album is just a warm-up for the DVD's wealth of music from artists on the CD and those that didn't make the cut. After hearing jam sessions and alternate takes, a Shirley Ann Lee radio show, Felton Williams' pedal steel lessons, the Mergers' oddball organ rocker ""Unworthy Americans"", and even the disorienting sounds of deteriorating tapes, it's hard to imagine uncovering more layers to the story. The documentary includes interviews with and performances by Williams, Lee, and Cooke, who rocks the pedal steel. Footage of sunlight striking a white cross and shots of weeds cracking through the asphalt of crumbling houses make the setting almost palpable. It's one thing to hear a tape of the young Shirley Ann Lee, but to watch her older self gently sing along to a recording of ""Please Accept My Prayer"" in the front seat of a parked car, and then whisper ""thank you"" as the shot fades to black, isn't easily captured in words. Downriver Revival not only adds a chapter to Numero's legacy of spotlighting the art and ambitions of forgotten artists, but it lets listeners share some of that rush of discovery.","Latest from Numero compiles the work of Ohio basement/studio Double U, and the highlight is a DVD with a 30-minute documentary and over 200 extra tracks.

Born Like This,DOOM,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a356b1335d7bf16986ea/1:1/w_160/1590951b.jpg,2009-04-06 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12869-born-like-this/,Lex,"What the hell happened to Daniel Dumile? People used to think MF DOOM was slacking if he only released one album a year, but sometime after The Mouse and the Mask, the  dude just up and vanished. That led to about three years' worth of fanbase-angering concerts featuring alleged impostors, theoretically planned albums promising Ghostface collaborations or a KMD revival that never arrived, scattered production work heavy on already-familiar Special Herbs leftovers, and a remixed Madvillainy faux-sequel with enough good-to-great Madlib beats to make you wish DOOM actually recorded new lyrics over them. The last time he went this far underground, his brother had just been killed and Elektra had booted KMD off the roster because Black Bastards was too controversial and uncommercial. So what could have provoked him to lay low in the latter half of this decade right when he seemed to be hitting critical pop-culture mass, limiting himself in recent years to sparse guest verses and the occasional official dispatch that he wasn't, in fact, dead? I don't have the answer to that question, but judging from the grimy, sinister lyricism displayed on Born Like This, at least this much is apparent: DOOM is not coming back just to dick around. It takes a little while to realize this, since the album feels strangely underformed on initial listens: A lot of tracks are one-verse quickies if they even feature DOOM at all, there's the occasional whiff of the overfamiliar (the 500th repurposing of Dilla's ""Lightworks""; an appearance of the three-year-old Ghostface/DOOM track ""Angelz""; a beat that samples ESG's ""UFO""), and the whole thing's just barely over 40 minutes. But there's something in DOOM's voice-- a focused rasp that's subtly grown slightly more ragged and intense-- that reveals something darker and deeper than the cartoon world in which he made himself a jocular adversary. Brak, Japanese space monsters, and the Fantastic Four have given way here to Charles Bukowski, whose apocalyptic ""Dinosauria, We"" gives the album its title and acts as the intro to the pivotal cut ""Cellz"". In that track, DOOM punctuates one of the most tightly knotted verses of his career by making note of those who miss the deeper meaning: ""Metalface Finster, playin' with the dirty money/ Sinister, don't know what he sayin' but the words be funny."" Yeah, Born Like This is still pretty funny; anyone who's amused by the kinds of strange linguistic and lyrical parallels and internal rhymes nobody else would think of has a good repertoire of quotable lines to draw from. But there's a stronger undercurrent of bitterness and a downturn in comedy, some of which feels tied in to a renewed malevolence in his villainous guise and some of which speaks towards something more personal. ""Once sold an inbred skinhead a n----r joke/ Plus a brand-new chrome smoker with the triggers broke,"" he spits in ""Gazzillion Ear"", an admission that partially echoes the same concerns that led Dave Chappelle to take himself off TV and is followed up on fleetingly in ""Ballskin"": ""Chrome grown men doin' business with Anglo Sax'n'em/ Lackin' swing but that banjo's so relaxin'."" And the overall subject matter can get grimier than Madvillainy converts are used to. ""Absolutely"" envisions a widely organized revenge plot against the entire legal system-- from snitches to police to judges-- where offending parties get their lattes poisoned and their tongues ripped out. ""Rap Ambush"" compares his M.O. to an insurgent attacking troops with guerilla tactics. And ""Batty Boyz"" features more concentrated homophobia than damn near any hip-hop track I've heard this decade, even if it's a little too goofy to be excessively hateful-- it's all aimed at Superman, Batman, and Robin on some hybrid ""Rapper's Delight""/Seduction of the Innocent business, though it could also be a metaphor clowning on the ripped, shirtless-posing ""homo thug"" MCs DOOM considers adversaries. (""Batty Boyz"" also samples a Jeff Dunham routine; between this and the Larry the Cable Guy clips in last year's Jake One collab ""Get 'Er Done"" it's possible that DOOM has tried to tone down his comedic streak by invoking comedians that aren't actually funny.) The more time you spend with Born Like This, the less the flaws actually feel like flaws and more like interesting diversions. ""Yessir"" is the track with the ""UFO"" sample and features Raekwon going solo, but the Chef sounds focused and fierce even if it feels like he's been beamed in from a completely different album. ""Angelz"" isn't necessarily improved with an added boom-clap kick to bolster its Charlie's Angels soundtrack loop, but hearing Ghostface and DOOM pull off abstract storytelling raps on the same track never gets old. And on an album filled with great production-- including four superb contributions from Jake One, Madlib assembling some top-notch gritty, noir-caliber soul jazz ambience on ""Absolutely"" and some of DOOM's most wide-ranging and bugged-out production yet (dude even fucks with warped Auto-Tune and Run-DMC drum machines on ""Supervillainz"")-- the out-of-the-vaults Dilla beat turns out to be the best. Not ""Lightworks"" (which DOOM rocks anyways), but ""Gazzillion Ear"", which makes inspired jumps between haunted-house soul and Midnight Express Moroder like it's no big deal. It's funny that Born Like This starts off feeling unfinished and, a couple listens later, starts to resonate as strongly as anything he's done since Madvillainy. I don't know if Born Like This arose from disillusionment or fatigue or something else, but whatever caused DOOM to scale back his output and go off the grid, he's only come back from it sharper, stronger, and more powerful than before. Villains don't really die, they just emerge from the rubble even more determined to make the world see their way.","Once a prolific indie hip-hop fixture on the verge of reaching a critical and commercial mass, Daniel Dumile finally makes a proper, potent return.

Tentacles,Crystal Antlers,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33d5e6ef959693205d9/1:1/w_160/66860010.jpg,2009-04-06 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12847-tentacles/,Touch and Go,"Cold War Kids tabbed Crystal Antlers as their opening act on an upcoming tour-- a surprising move considering CWK represents, in part, blog-savvy music fans prioritizing the familiar over the daring, while Crystal Antlers trade in styles often treated with disinterest or sometimes outright derision. Antlers are a heavy and especially loud psych-punk band, but they lack the outsider cachet of metal or noise; their psychedelia is more shaggy than dreamy and they're not stone-rock enough to sidle up next to, say, Black Mountain or Comets on Fire. Then again, if there really is a crossover album in these guys, what would it even sound like? It probably wouldn't sound like Tentacles. Though far from a disappointment (and actually something of a grower), Crystal Antlers' proper debut is, more than their EP, the sound of a band still with more potential than goods. Essentially, the band is fine-tuning and trouble-shooting its approach, a risky move considering how many bands that didn't immediately and immensely top their EP have been jettisoned, wrongfully or rightfully. EP drew its strengths from dynamics and artfully missing marks-- high point ""A Thousand Eyes"" treated genre like a park wizard hopping between five different simultaneous chess games; now the band's sounds seem tidily compartmentalized. It turns Tentacles into a surprisingly focused affair-- even though it contains twice as many tracks as EP, it's about 15 minutes longer. Opener ""Painless Sleep"" features Victor Rodriguez's skidding organ peals skipping over themselves, showing a sense of playfulness that's unique in Crystal Antlers' line of work. But immediately following, ""Dust"" and ""Time Erased"", despite their forceful rhythms, display a worrying compositional consistency that at times feels like a crutch. Truth be told, melody isn't exactly the most impressive strength of singer/bassist Jonny Bell. His strangulated wail barks out clipped fragments before slamming on the breaks. In the context of their whiplash live show, these sort of dynamics are thrilling and necessary; yet the sound here feels more treble-heavy and brittle, ranging from loud to slightly louder. ""Andrew"" is the first break in this template and unquestionably the most promising moment of the record's first half. It's not too far off the path of EP's bong-loaded slower numbers, but there's a surprisingly vulnerability in Bell's wail-- ""don't let me die all alone"" becomes one of the few intelligible lyrics on Tentacles. ""Until The Sun Dies, Pt. 1"" bisects Tentacles and augurs a surprisingly mellow side B that often relegates guitar into texture and turns organ as a lead instrument. It's a promising development that gives Crystal Antlers a sound that sets them apart from their contemporaries. Whether or not Tentacles is considered the jumping off point for a promising career or a jumping off point for bandwagoneers, there's a weight on it that goes beyond mere expectation: It will likely be the last new release on Touch and Go Records. It felt like such a great fit-- what better home for loud, yet accessible bands that fell just shy of Sub Pop or Matador or Merge middlebrow? But even Crystal Antlers have a substantially brighter outlook than that of Touch and Go, both are still in the same place as of now, plotting the course for a future that just got muddy more quickly than expected.","Crystal Antlers' proper debut-- the last new record on Touch and Go for the foreseeable future-- is, more than their EP, a focused, monochromatic record.

DJ Skee Presents: The Best of the Hamiltonization Process,Charles Hamilton,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2cf5e6ef959693204e0/1:1/w_160/e6569607.jpeg,2009-04-03 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12761-dj-skee-presents-the-best-of-the-hamiltonization-process/,self-releasedself-released,"The internet didn't invent mixtape rappers, it didn't invent hustle, and it didn't invent making enough local noise until the majors could no longer ignore you. Outside of Soulja Boy, it hasn't invented a new way to create a bonafide hip-hop sensation-- though the precocious, 21-year old Charles Hamilton is among a clutch of rappers (Wale, Bishop Lamont, Kid Cudi also among them) who've parlayed their buzz into label deals, but each has found themselves in a hinterland of the most vague release strategies possible. Tellingly, it's Asher Roth's career-stoking and hopefully career-ending ""I Love College"" that stands as pretty much the only song the tangible world has heard from any of these guys. But if Charles Hamilton's Interscope debut (with rumored production from Pharrell) ever does drop, The Best of the Hamiltonization Process suggests that, well, it's hard to say. ""Future of rap"" accolades aside, he's more like the present-- Lil Wayne's prolificacy meets Kanye West's extroverted self-consciousness (""Please don't call me a hipster/ I'm from the heart not from the hip"") meets Lupe Fiasco's Complex-jocking fashion sense. The Best is about as old-fashioned, hit pause/record as mixtapes get these days, and as a collection, you get to hear Hamilton learn on the job. He's surprisingly laconic for someone whose work ethic is his calling card, but the results are likely to resonate with anyone who's felt the urge to write on a daily basis-- at points, Hamilton is particularly inspired, more often than not when alluding to his past drug abuse or familial dischord. He doesn't get particularly specific, often coming at his subjects from asides, but ""Waterworks"" and ""Mr. Perfect"" (featuring a surprisingly effective disembody of Hoobastank's ""The Reason"") are all the more affecting for steering clear of overly maudlin closet clearing. Other times, it's just production for production's sake, as with the terribly annoying (however heartfelt) porno love letter ""Lacey Duvalle"" and the single ""Brooklyn Girls"", which saddles his potential hit with the same grating ""Good Life"" flow throughout. But as chameleonic as he proves to be on the mic, he's still got a ways to go in terms of picking beats that don't overpower his rhymes and with writing hooks, i.e., the things that help listeners get through 22-track tapes. If you're wondering why a self-contained entity like Hamilton is looking to work with a dude like Skateboard P, consider how the stickiest chorus turns up on ""Windows Media Player"", where Hamilton lists his various web-based hustles like Mike Jones gone pop-up ad. And the last thing we need are rappers who think dropping Matrix raps are automatically deep and rappers who think dropping video game references are automatically clever, but on the trebly, overbearing ""Happy Ending"", Hamilton asks you either call him ""Neo"" or ""Neo Geo"" for no real good reason. It's tough to say exactly what you're evaluating here: The Best is somewhat defined as much by what it isn't (Hamilton's proper debut) by what it is (a somewhat haphazard sampling from nearly a dozen mixtapes and hundreds of tracks). Fair or unfair, it can be compared to Wale's fantastic Mixtape About Nothing-- unfair because the latter was a mixtape in name only (featuring hi-fi production, a legitimate concept, guest stars), while the former is intentionally a patchwork. But ultimately, the bigger problem revolves around a lack of scope typical of people who spend most of their days on rap message boards-- for now, The Best stands up better as a primer on a formative talent than an exhibit of it.","Highly promising Brooklyn MC has inspired (and even inspiring) moments on his ""best of"" mixtape.

BiRd-BrAiNs,Tune-Yards,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a342ea9e61561daa4c32/1:1/w_160/4f1c120b.jpg,2009-04-03 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12851-bird-brains/,Marriage,"When you talk about lo-fi more or less inspired by folk, the best stuff always carries with it a sense of discovery. Cheap and tinny acoustic music should feel like something you stumbled upon, like maybe you dug it out of an old drawer or rescued it from the freebee bin in the thrift store. And then the force of the music should sparkle through the grit and hiss and distortion and make you think you understand something about the person making it. It's a romantic notion, one not necessarily based in reality. But the best music in this vein manages to convey a sense of intimacy, as if it's a one-to-one conversation between the artist and the listener. That's how BiRd-BrAiNs feels. It's the debut album by Merrill Garbus' tUnE-yArDs (she's the lone member of the band) and it was recorded on a digital voice recorder and assembled using shareware mixing software. Garbus' primary instrument is ukulele, the tone of which is thin and trebly and lonesome, the sound you usually get from a barrel-scraping demos collection issued long after someone is dead. To this she adds her own field recordings-- the sound outside her window, a child being asked about blueberries, indistinct creaks and clatter-- along with occasional percussion that seems to consist of whatever nearby could be smacked or shaken. Some songs loop these elements into mini-epics that bring to mind an early, crude version of Juana Molina's one-woman-band aesthetic; others sound like they're being whispered around a late-night campfire burning a few tents over. The ""production"" is rough, and not always in an appealing way. The sub-demo quality's most annoying attribute is the blocky digital clipping that happens whenever the voice recorder is overloaded, which is often. So if you don't have a tolerance for cut-rate sonics-- and this isn't even the warm analog stuff-- forget about it. But if you do, the best songs on BiRd-BrAiNs can sneak up on you. The ultimate draw is Garbus' voice, which can be husky and serious or else pitched up to make her sound like a kid humming to herself to pass the time. She's got a respectable amount of power and range, but more importantly, she sings with abandon. Take ""Sunlight"", a track that made its way around as a pre-release mp3. On it she begins low and sensual, purring the verses like a 1970s folkie about to lay down something heavy as a for-real drum kit bangs out a half-funk loop and an electric guitar scratches along. And then the song pivots and Garbus explodes into the chorus. Each successive ""I could be the sunlight in your eyes, couldn't I?"" is more desperate than the last, the frantic plea of someone who has never been seen. It's cathartic even as it leaves you hanging, the sort of song that begs for repeat plays. Only one other song matches ""Sunlight"", and I'll get to it in a moment, but several others come close. ""Lions"" is both charming and creepy, halfway between a singsong schoolyard rhyme and a graveyard blues. The wordless vocalizations in the folk-hop ""Hatari"" could fairly be described as yodeling, but Garbus sells the warble with her fearlessness (here's someone who never bothered to wonder if she might be annoying people, and her boldness gives her an edge.) ""There is a natural sound that wild things make when they're bound"" is ""Hatari""'s closing line, which is a perfect description of Garbus' unhinged mode. In between the best moments are some formless stretches populated with a few decent songs that never quite fulfill their promise. Still, the time spent collecting and assembling (BiRd-BrAiNs was put together over two years) turned up a few things worth holding onto. Like ""Fiya"", the second-to-last song, which manages to grab the best elements of everything that came before. We get a simple and pretty melody on the verses, the ""seems like it's always been around"" kind of tune Devendra Banhart wrote so effortlessly on Rejoicing in the Hands and Niño Rojo. And then there's a subtle build, where additional instruments are folded in and the clutter increases the track's intensity. The structure is a perfect match for ""Fiya""'s theme, which is about transforming extreme self-loathing into something else. ""What if my own skin makes my skin crawl?"", Garbus wonders. She concludes that a relationship's failure only makes sense if she is, in fact, ""nothing at all."" And then she moves on to singing ""You are always on my mind"" four times, toying with the canonical phrase (it almost sounds like ""were always on my mind"") and making it her own before finally letting loose with that ""wild thing"" sound. Her amazing wail answers her earlier question: What if your own skin makes your skin crawl? Well, maybe you try and turn those feelings into something. Like, say, write and record a terrifically moving song called ""Fiya"" in your living room. You'll feel a little better. And then those of us who understand those shitty feelings can sit around and listen to ""Fiya"", and we'll feel better too. That's what the intimacy of home-recorded music is all about.","Like the best lo-fi music, this debut LP manages to convey a sense of intimacy, as if it's a one-to-one conversation between the artist and the listener.

One,Ben Klock,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a302b1335d7bf1698612/1:1/w_160/dc3fd391.jpeg,2009-04-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12803-one/,Ostgut Ton,"During a time when many DJs and producers aim for aggressively minimal compositions, Berlin-based artist Ben Klock seemingly flips the equation, submitting a debut album that skates along under subtly violent, gray skies. Rumbling bass kicks, distressed divas, and short, snapping arpeggios characterize an album that sounds constantly under threat, usually from within. A resident DJ at Berlin's famed Berghain club, Klock has been dropping singles and remixes-- many of them on BPitch Control and the Berghain-affiliated Ostgut Ton-- since the turn of the century. One follows January's aptly titled Before One EP, a stamp of four metallic cuts that ramped up anticipation for the full-length and ensured that Ostgut Ton would remain relevant after last year's overlooked (here we sit, red-faced) Shed album and the continuation of their excellent Berghain mix series (Berghain 03, coming later this year, will be mixed by Len Faki). One lives up to the reputation of both Klock and Ostgut. ""Coney Island"" opens the album blasting chewy, serrated clusters of sound, quickly climbing and descending in pitch. ""OK"" sounds like a micro-house of bricks, if you'll permit a pun, an insistent bass thud and industrial claps competing with a diva's looped refrain, ""Ain't no happiness/ Ain't no sadness."" It'd sound a little silly were it not for One's pervasive distress. ""Goodly Sin"" propels itself forward with a brisk, knee-knocking club thump, its mostly wordless vocal samples swaying like seaweed in an undercurrent. ""Grip"" pans grated hunks of space-synth between your speakers as what sounds like a miniature string section adds plasticized decadence. One alternates between quick, ornery floor-fillers and more ominous, clawing downbeat tracks. It's an old trick that's masked somewhat by Klock's deceptive use of tempo: slow numbers often begin with a quick burst of melody, while faster tracks linger before gaining momentum. ""Underneath"" quivers nervously, a few drippy synth notes the only thing that rises from its quiet midnight groove. ""Init One"" palpitates and quivers before releasing into ""Cargo""'s aluminum-walled library. Klock abandons some of his haste and propulsion during One's second half, seemingly intent on breaking his ringing tech sound against the roof of his mouth. ""Init Two"" beefs up its sibling's whispers into saturated pulses. ""Gold Rush"" moves in fits and starts, its clingy industrial jangle acting like a lure. ""Thirteen Rounds"" ekes out one last hushed kick at the end of the album after a series of bangers. The record's second half, blurry at the edges, might've benefited from one of the flush wall-rattlers left on Before One. But Klock never allows one to entrench in one groove or sound. Even as the tempos slow and the textures (slightly) soften, Klock knows that his noises need not be sparse or infrequent to keep you glancing over your shoulder.","Where many DJs and producers aim for aggressively minimal compositions, Berlin-based artist Ben Klock flips the equation on his full-length debut.

Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970’s Funky Lagos,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a366ea9e61561daa4c7c/1:1/w_160/ce53d281.jpg,2009-04-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12881-nigeria-70-the-definitive-story-of-1970s-funky-lagos/,StrutStrut,"Last year was a disorienting, somewhat disconnected time if you were looking for any kind of lucid pop music narrative, but one thing was for sure in 2008: All you had to do was wait a month or so, and you'd get the chance to hear yet another entry in an incredible influx of compilations, reissues, and revivals of the music of West Africa in the 1970s. There was Soundway's (so far) three-part Nigeria Special series, which gathered a bountiful collection of highlife, Afrobeat, funk, rock, and disco, and they followed it up with the eye-opening Sir Victor Uwaifo compilation Guitar Boy Superstar. Germany's freshly-minted Analog Africa label assembled a number of incredible highlife/funk/psych songs from Togo and Benin under the title African Scream Contest, then put together the staggering Orchestre Poly-Rhythmo de Cotonou highlight reel The Vodoun Effect: Funk and Sato from Benin's Obscure Label. And amidst all of this, Fela Kuti's son Seun reunited with his father's band Egypt 80 to record his debut full-length Many Things, taking the Afrobeat revival one step further by creating one of the genre's best new records of the last 25 years. All that, and Strut's ceaselessly entertaining Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump, too-- that's a ridiculously bountiful collection of music. But even amidst all those releases, Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump isn't an afterthought-- it is, after all, the followup to one of the most crucial Afrobeat comps, 2001's Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos. The original Nigeria 70 was released four years after Fela Kuti's death and in the midst of a renewed interest in Afrobeat-- Femi Kuti's Fight to Win enlisted Mos Def and Common in a hip hop crossover bid, and Antibalas was really starting to pick up steam-- so it served as one of the most contextually important collections of the genre as it stood in its original heyday. With this reissue, it still holds that status: Nigeria 70 assembles a potent collection of names that were already famous among aficionados of African music (Fela; Tony Allen; King Sunny Ade), augments them with lesser-known musicians that those aficionados would also likely enjoy, and subsequently captures a cross-section of Nigerian culture that covers that country's adaptations of nearly everything that was going on in black music at the time. Nigeria 70 starts with Monomono's ""Loma Da Nigbehin"", where the groove is stepped up, the rhythm guitar emphasized, the percussion denser yet livelier, the horn and organ solos heavier-- all developments created in the wake of Fela's revolution in militant funk. Afrobeat in that familiar vein is widely covered here, both inside and outside of the Kalakuta Republic. Two of Fela's greatest Africa '70-era recordings appear in ""Upside Down"" and ""Jeun Ko Ku (Chop 'n' Quench)"",  while Afrobeat's rhythmic architect and Africa '70 alumnus Tony Allen is represented by his glimmering 1980 recording ""No Discrimination"".  And many of the highlights from less-famous musicians-- Peter King's ""Shango""; Orlando Julius Ekemode's ""Alo Mi Alo""; Afro Cult Foundation's ""The Quest""-- take Kuti's sounds and tweak them playfully until they become a bit more concise or abstract. But what makes Nigeria 70 particularly compelling is its sonic diversity. Anyone expecting two and a half hours of music that sounds directly informed by Fela might be surprised to find out just how many musicians saw his music as a starting point than the sum of their sound. There's nods to psychedelic rock, both heavily fuzzed-out (Ofo & the Black Company's stomping, wailing ""Allah Wakbarr"") and Deadhead-friendly mellow (BLO's eerily beautiful reverie ""Chant to Mother Earth""). A few forays into the late 1970s and early 80s note a disco influence that informs cuts like Joni Haastrup's 1977 song ""Greetings"" and Shina Williams & His African Percussionists' 1984 electro-funk workout ""Agboju Logun"" without removing their Afrobeat backbone. And if you're wondering how Parliament-Funkadelic was received in Nigeria, William Onyeabor's 1978 anti-imperialist synthesizer opus ""Better Change Your Mind"" is an intriguing hint. You could while away some time trying to figure out just how much or how little of it came from black music in America, and how much of black music in America actually owed to these sounds in the first place-- as cross-cultural development of pop music goes, the Nigerian sound is fascinatingly tangled. And now, even after the West African reissue glut of 2008, Nigeria 70 still sounds illuminating.","After a year chock full of amazing West African 1970s reissues, the classic and crucial Nigeria 70 comp is reissued.

Ten: Deluxe Edition,Pearl Jam,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35bb1335d7bf16986f5/1:1/w_160/5b47588a.jpg,2009-04-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12873-ten-deluxe-edition/,EpicLegacyEpicLegacy,"Ten may be classic rock today, but it's easy to underestimate how radical Pearl Jam sounded back in 1991, even with Nirvana ascendant. After several long years of hair metal dominance, here was a band that could jam stadium-large, texture their sound darkly and densely, and explode the blues-rock template. Here was a frontman with an entirely new stage presence, whose voice strained hard for sincerity and whose songwriting expressed grave self-reckoning without resorting to easy sentiments or self-glorifying choruses. Against the odds-- as well as against the band's wishes, apparently-- their debut became a phenomenon, an alt-rock figurehead as crucial as Nevermind in ushering in and defining the parameters for mainstream rock. Vedder's self-doubts ran as deep as Cobain's, but he expressed them bluntly and directly rather than poetically and obscurely. Oh and also, he's still alive. Deeply invested in the cathartic possibilities of punk and classic rock, Pearl Jam seemingly made music as a form of self-therapy, an idea that took hold with nearly a decade of alt-rock acts to come. The band is routinely blamed for the self-gratifying Stone Temple Pilots, Creeds, and Nicklebacks that followed Ten, but the band naturally never set out to remake rock music in its own image. Suspicious of the hedonism of the arena rock that preceded them, Pearl Jam were a solemn band, and Ten sounds nothing if not entirely serious about animating Vedder's self-doubts. At times, it's a bit overwrought (""I don't question our existence/ I just question our modern needs""), but the earnestness with which Vedder sang and the band played these songs belies the decade's reputation as a period of pervasive irony. Ultimately, the 1990s wouldn't have been so bad if Pearl Jam's followers hadn't aped their self-seriousness so relentlessly. Nevertheless, Ten remains impressive and occasionally moving 18 years later, even gentrified with a shiny reissue. The public perception of the album is watered down thanks mainly to the excision of ""Alive"", ""Jeremy"", and ""Even Flow"" as singles. The latter two may be the album's least remarkable tracks: ""Jeremy"" is the most pat Freudian psychodrama on an album full of them, and ""Evenflow"" romanticizes homelessness as spiritually transcendent. But ""Alive"" remains potent not only because Vedder touches on some seriously transgressive shit here (dead fathers, hints at incest, survivor guilt), but mostly because the band rock the hell out of that coda. Today, Ten lives and dies by its album tracks, and while there are a few clunkers, most are pretty ballsy in their disdain for expectations. Granted, as a new band with few realistic prospects for the kind of success they quickly achieved, Pearl Jam were working with a very different set of expectations than the ones retroactively assigned to them. On songs like ""Once"", with its insistent breakdowns, and ""Black"", with strangely dramatic vocalizations, there's a hardscrabble dynamic that the band would be unable to capture on subsequent releases. ""Why Go"" is ferocious in its outrage, with Vedder delivering his most pained vocals, and Stone Gossard and Mike McCready match him on every song, translating Vedder's howls into messy, edge-of-the-precipice solos and paint-peeling riffs like the one that anchors ""Deep"". In addition to the original album as produced by Rick Parashar and mixed by Tim Palmer, the new reissue includes a second disc, titled Ten Redux, that includes a new mix by Brendan O'Brien. A few of these new versions appeared on 2004's best-of Rearviewmirror, and O'Brien, who has worked with Pearl Jam on most of their subsequent albums, brings Vedder's ad libs to the forefront, sharpens some of the guitar riffs, and generally cleans up the murkiness. Sounding like 2005 rather than 1991, Ten Redux misses the point: The album's murkiness was one of its chief attractions, its flawed spontaneity feeding the songs' of-the-moment intensity. Ultimately, these new versions have less to do with Pearl Jam's music than with O'Brien's superfandom. Ten Redux closes with a paltry six bonus tracks. ""2,000 Mile Blues"" is atrocious Jimi worship, ""Evil Little Goat"" is Vedder's best Jim Morrison impersonation, and neither ""Breath"" (here retitled ""Breath and a Scream"") nor ""State of Love and Trust"" sound as vital here as they did on the Singles soundtrack. These tracks are obviously intended not to overlap with 2003's Lost Dogs: Rarities and B-Sides, but flipsides like ""Dirty Frank"" and ""Yellow Ledbetter"" were surprisingly popular satellites orbiting Ten, played often on radio stations that didn't typically delve that deep into any artist's catalog and shouted at concerts by fans who weren't that fanatic. Their absence limits the reissue, creating an incomplete portrait of the band in its earliest days. Ten deserved better than Ten Redux and the paltry bonus tracks. Fortunately, the reissue also includes a DVD of Pearl Jam's 1992 performance on ""MTV Unplugged"". The fashions are of course dated (nice fuzzy hat, Jeff Ament) and Vedder's stool-bound intensity can be fairly ridiculous, but the DVD is a useful and entertaining document of their intense live sets. Thanks to the tight rhythms of drummer Dave Abbruzzese and bass player Ament, the songs lose little of their momentum in this setting, which handily showcases the guitar interplay between Gossard and McCready. But this is Vedder's show-- a live, public debut for his idiosyncrasies. Taking the stage in a tight jacket and backwards baseball cap, he gradually unleashes himself during the show, first letting his hair down and then eventually losing the jacket. By show's end, he's balancing precariously on his stool and scrawling PRO CHOICE!!! on his arms with a Sharpie. Pearl Jam may have shunned the spotlight, but they were born showmen.","A key template for almost two decades of mainstream rock is reissued with a new mix, extra songs, and a DVD of the group's ""MTV Unplugged"" show.

Capades,Obi Best,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3065e6ef9596932055d/1:1/w_160/49f9624e.jpeg,2009-04-02 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12806-capades/,Social Science,"Variations on the quirky girly-girl pop archetype (Feist, Nellie McKay, Regina Spektor, St. Vincent, Lavender Diamond) have flourished over the past half-decade, proving the market for inventive post-modernizations of Connie Francis, Patti Page, and the Maguire Sisters. Alex Lilly, backup singer for Blue Note pop-traditionalists the Bird and the Bee, has been playing her brand of supper-club chamber-pop around L.A. for the past few years, much of which is gathered here on Capades, her formal LP debut. It's mannered but not quite meticulous, sometimes hammy and occasionally subversively catchy, but always precious: the name Obi Best did emerge from her shorthand for ""oh, be your best."" While Capades doesn't rise to the level of the RIYLs that opened this review, Lilly's update of starry-eyed-and-lovelorn-- little songs, mostly written around simple piano figures-- never get too weighty, but still manage a bit of rewarding variation. She works in two registers, mainly: first is the airy, synth-based romantic rumination. ""Blooms Like Flowers"" is a feather-light meditation on time-- the object of the song seems to have endless gardens of it. Earlier, when trying to explain another ineffable feeling in the same style, she can only say it's ""like green and white stripes."" ""Who Loves You Now"" isn't as forceful as its title might indicate (the lyric ""I'll say anything to be close to you"" underscores that). It's just an honest question asked politely amidst tinkling piano, drum machine, miniature firework sfx, and overdubbed ""doo-doo"" vocables, all of which expands into a shimmering refrain. Lilly's voice is the main attraction on these songs, shifting slightly but effectively between coy low-profile and mannered theatricality. Her more direct and proactive second mode-- more in tune with an early-1990s ""Buzz Bin"" mode of punchy femininity (Letters to Cleo, anyone?)-- emphasizes these shifts well. ""What It's Not"" is buoyed by a Spoon-like left-handed piano and off-kilter rhythm before collapsing into a chorus packed with desperation and anxiety. Swinging opener ""Nothing Can Come Between Us"" sounds like the work of a teenager who's gotten really good at her piano lessons, and makes a compelling case for sticking it out in a relationship, only this time without panicking. ""It's Because of People Like You"" offsets its frustrating origin-- a mean note pinched in Lilly's wiper blade-- with a positively geeky organ and a refrain that's not necessarily going to instigate a fistfight: ""One more person tries to show me their faulty logic, god help me/ I will lend them brains to borrow."" More than anything, Lilly's long-in-the-works debut shows that she's able to express adult hopes and fears with a sense of little-girl wonder and, for the most part, resist the urge to get too darling on us. The songs that don't work as well, then, are those that tend too much toward the cheek-clenchingly girly: ""Swedish Boy"" skips along like a 10-year-old with a crush on Jens Lekman, scribbling with crayons on staff paper, ""It seems to me you live in a made-up country."" ""Origami""-- with naïve lyrics like ""Paper cranes and daisies say I love you,"" and a sluggish groove in lieu of a sunny melody-- feels out of place. But coming to terms with one's childhood and learning from it is all part of growing up, right? Let's hope that a natural part of Lilly's artistic maturation involves shedding these residual bits of her youth and expanding on her far more engaging approach to adult matters.","Alex Lilly, backup singer for the Bird and the Bee, here gathers much of the supper-club chamber-pop she's been playing around L.A. for the past few years.

Pop Ambient 2009,Various Artists,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a351c0084474cd0c0246/1:1/w_160/d711fc40.jpg,2009-04-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12864-pop-ambient-2009/,Kompakt,"Ah, the Pop Ambient compilation. So reliable, so consistent, you could almost set your watch to the darn thing. Every year, it shows up around the same time with those same Photoshopped flowers. It features the same loose collection of artists (Klimek's back!) who share the same central aim: to rub some ointment on your post-winter blues with the gentle drifts and glides fans of the series have come to expect. The comp is rarely astounding and at the same time, never really disappointing. With a few minor tweaks to their time-tested formula and a couple fresh faces onboard, Kompakt's 2009 installment of its annual ambient-techno roundup is no different. As he's done in the past, label head Wolfgang Voigt serves as the set's curator. Perhaps encouraged by the warm reception to his (excellent) Nah Und Fern boxset from last year, the Gas mastermind also contributes a handful of new songs to PA09. Sadly they're not his finest. Under his Mint moniker, Voigt presents ""Hindemith"", a relatively ho-hum concoction of spare piano, horns, and his signature vapor-like hiss. He teams up with longtime pal Jörg Burger for a pair of tracks: a pleasant but mostly forgettable remix of Jürgen Paape's ""Ausklang"" and ""Frieden"", a Burger/Voigt original that's easily the best of his three offerings. With deep basslines and active, echoing synths, it's equally soothing and dynamic, just what you want out of a Pop Ambient cut. In addition to PA mainstays such as Andrew Thomas, Voigt and co. invite some new collaborators into the mix this year, and the album's prime cuts are split between its veterans and rookies. Popnoname (real name Jens Uwe Beyer), a producer who honed his skills on these compilations before venturing into solo material, offers once such standout in ""Nightliner"". He dunks a mild bass-guitar thump into a warm noise bath to coax an astral, floating quality from the track; the result is a delicious dose of auditory Percocet. Newcomers the Fun Years-- an intriguing inclusion as a guitar-based outfit-- also manage a winner with ""I Am Speaking Through Barbara"". A sort of post-rock/shoegaze hybrid, the song's organic textures offer satisfying contrast to the digital sounds elsewhere. Other stretches of PA09 illustrate the series' gradual shift towards the orchestral, a trend that has characterized the past several entries and frustrated some longtime listeners. Such gripes are easy to understand, since a degree of propulsion (some beats here and there) is what sets ambient techno apart from, say, modern classical. That distinction is largely ignored on the disc's front half, though, where Klimek opens with ""True Enemies & False Friends (Yesteryears Suite)"", a regal-sounding brasswind piece before French composer Sylvain Chauveau drops two avant-classical numbers-- odd additions, since Chauveau's songs are a few years old (dating back to his 2007 Nuage soundtrack) and in a way represent a style that some simply aren't looking for from Pop Ambient. Anyone bummed by these inclusions could claim that the abundance of non-Kompakt artists included here points to a lack of fresh ideas from the label, and that may be the case. Purists might even argue the venerated imprint's best days are behind it, and, indeed, one listen to any of the four Gas LPs makes many of PA09's tracks feel minor-league by comparison. But Voigt's interest in adjacent styles and willingness to draw from outside his own roster suggests to me that he's still engaged in the form and curious about what his past creations have wrought. And with a few minor exceptions (most notably the Field in 2007), Pop Ambient historically hasn't been the launching pad for Kompakt's hot new acts-- that's what the Total compilations are for. Instead, the series is more of a perennial thank-you note sent to a niche fanbase. If you've made it this far into my review, chances are you're one of the folks who received (and appreciated) the last missive, as you will this one and the next.","Kompakt's dependable compilation series, again curated by Wolfgang Voigt, returns with another balm for the post-winter blues.

Laughing Boy,Matteah Baim,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ffea9e61561daa4b9f/1:1/w_160/713b77d1.jpeg,2009-04-02 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12800-laughing-boy/,Dicristina,"Matteah Baim started out as a visual artist before turning her attention to music a few years ago, but she is probably best known for her role as one half of the self-dubbed ""soft metal"" duo Metallic Falcons, alongside Sierra Casady of CocoRosie. Their one and only album, the extraordinary Desert Doughnuts, featured layer upon layer of heady, rich landscapes and cryptic imagery, while maintaining an intangible, almost magical presence that ultimately set the record apart as something special and original. Now that Metallic Falcons are on hiatus, Baim is concentrating on her own solo material. For her second album, Laughing Boy, New York-based Baim gathered a cast of Chicago indie all-stars, including 90 Day Men's Rob Lowe, artist Rose Lazar, and members of Pit er Pat. It's a smart move-- although Baim has a strong, haunting presence as a songwriter, it is her collaboration with these other distinctive musical personalities that keeps the album moving. One suspects this group interplay leads these songs in their most surprising directions, through the constant introduction of different ideas, styles, and approaches to composition. You get the feeling that while the basic blueprint of the songs may have been in place from the start, Laughing Boy is predominantly created out of Baim and co.'s spontaneous jams. There's a charming clumsiness about this album-- its intentionally playful, spur-of-the-moment melodies create an expressive, mysterious atmosphere that always comes to a close at just the right moment. Fuego's drumming, usually in a creative wrestle against the downbeat, and Lowe's sinewy bass lines give backbone to her adventurous vocal patterns, congas, handclaps, and string arrangements, which peek in and out of the songs with natural fluidity and provide a wonderful vessel for her abstract lyrics. Even without that help, Baim has a mesmerizing, velvety voice that dips and soars in accordance to her atypical phrasing, and at times it sounds as though she's singing a lullaby straight into your ear. On Laughing Boy, her vocals almost have a 1960s lounge vibe-- though inevitably much darker, riddled with ambiguous spookiness. She pairs up with other vocalists on the a cappella cover of Jim Morrisson's ""Bird of Prey"" and ""He Turned My Mind Around"", experimenting further with the loose song structures that make up the bulk of the album. From the brief rush of bells on ""Maths on Fire"" to the echo of breathy resonance on ""The Whistler"", it's both clear that Baim isn't afraid to slip unusual interludes between her psychedelic improvisations, and that her mix of the familiar and the unexpected is a winning combination.","One half of Metallic Falcons, New York-based songwriter gathers a cast of Chicago indie all-stars to help craft this solo record.

Raise / Mezcal Head,Swervedriver,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a339b1335d7bf16986a3/1:1/w_160/ada97121.jpg,2009-04-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12846-raise-mezcal-head/,CreationHi-Speed SoulSecond MotionCreationHi-Speed SoulSecond Motion,"It seems that in every musical movement, there are worthy artists who get lost in the shuffle. In the case of Britain's late-1980s/early-90s shoegazer scene, Swervedriver had the unfortunate distinction of being one of those bands. Forged in the same Oxford milieu that produced Ride and Radiohead, they were positioned under the shoegaze umbrella because of their sound, not their attitude. While many bands operating in similar territory earned the title by literally standing on stage staring at the floor (which was covered in guitar pedals) and letting their lyrics get swept away in the texture of the music, Swervedriver projected a tougher image, drawing their name and much of their lyrical imagery from American car culture and films. If their counterparts were about capturing the look of a vapor trail in their guitar tones, Swervedriver's Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge were more about simulating the rocket ride that produced the trail in the first place. They sounded great on a car stereo. Because of this, they were much better equipped to make it big in the U.S. than peers like Ride, Slowdive, Chapterhouse, and even My Bloody Valentine; for all the usual boring reasons (label trouble, lineup instability), it didn't pan out that way. They released four albums, only three of which came out stateside, and filled in the space around them with a shelf's worth of EPs and 7""s before hanging it up-- temporarily, as it turned out-- in 1999. Their first two albums, Raise and Mezcal Head, languished out of print for years before BMG resurrected them last year, and Hi-Speed Soul is giving them a second run in America with a slightly expanded tracklist. 1991's Raise was a quality debut, and it's dated surprisingly well. The muscular, scorching guitars are the heart of the album, and they still bring the noise like nobody's business. The big distortion and interlocking riffs give most of the album a dense, bright sound with a lot of punch. ""Son of Mustang Ford"" rumbles like the car it's named for, ""Rave Down"" launches into hyperspace after three minutes of tense, grungy crunching, and ""Sunset"" pulls back a bit, layering cleaner guitars than usual over a bubbling bassline and unison vocals. While the band had already perfected its sonic punch, the songwriting was a bit of a work in progress. Outside of ""Sunset"", Raise is somewhat wanting for sharp vocal melodies, with Franklin and Hartridge trading off deadpan intonations. Two years later, on Mezcal Head, the songs caught up to the guitars. ""For Seeking Heat"", ""Girl on a Motorbike"", ""You Find It Everywhere"", and ""Blowin' Cool"" weave laser-guided melodies through tangles of distortion-drenched guitar. The band lost its original rhythm section between albums, but new drummer Jez Hindmarsh absolutely crushes his kit, matching the intensity of the guitar maelstrom. ""Last Train to Satansville"" is the height of alt-rock badassery, opening with the brilliant couplet ""'You look like you've been losing sleep,' said the stranger on a train/ I fixed him with an ice-cold stare and said, 'I've been having those dreams again.'"" The sentiment is backed up with a monster guitar riff and chunky rhythm, and if I had to pick just one Swervedriver song to introduce the band, that'd be it. Just as every movement has overlooked artists, every movement has lost classics, and Mezcal Head really is the lost classic of the shoegaze movement, visceral but tuneful, and perhaps the nearest simulation of a rocket launch recorded in the 90s. The reissues each add four period bonus tracks, which seem more or less to be a random selection from over a dozen available EP and 7"" offerings. Mezcal Head drops the 12-minute ""Never Lose That Feeling/Never Learn"" meltdown that closed the original U.S. version of the album, replacing it with the shorter EP version of ""Never Lose That Feeling"". Overall, it's high-quality stuff-- especially Raise bonus ""Andalucia""-- but it won't give a collector any closure, especially given that one of the passed-over tracks is the wicked, steel guitar-soaked headrush ""Scrawl & Scream"", from 1991's Reel to Real EP. Castle Music's Juggernaut Rides compilation remains the best source for Swervedriver's rarities. For an introduction to the band, though, Mezcal Head can't be beat, and it's great to have it and Raise available again. If you missed them the first time or simply weren't around to hear them, Swervedriver is worth the trip back in time.","Oft-overlooked outfit reissues two early-1990s albums with bonus tracks, giving another chance to hear its more biting and direct approach to shoegaze.

25 O'Clock / Psonic Psunspot,The Dukes of Stratosphear,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3749d034d5c69bf2e15/1:1/w_160/326f53c2.jpg,2009-04-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12893-25-oclock-psonic-psunspot/,VirginApe House Ltd.VirginApe House Ltd.,"It all started after XTC's Andy Partridge and producer John Leckie (Stone Roses) got tossed off a producer gig for Mary Margaret O'Hara's Miss America record for reasons that may involve strangeness on O'Hara's part, or religious differences, or the fact that Partridge told the band they needed a click track. As Chris Twomey's XTC biography Chalkhills and Children recounts, Leckie wanted to get something back for the time he'd lost waiting for the O'Hara gig. Partridge mentioned that he and bandmate Colin Moulding had written a bunch of psychedelic songs that were too out-there for XTC; Leckie pitched it to Virgin, asking them for £5,000 to cut a record. When they were done, they returned £1,000 of it. The first EP, 25 O'Clock, shipped on April Fools' Day 1985, and it was rumored at the time (and official not long after) that the Dukes of Stratosphear were really XTC-- with Partridge and Moulding as Sir John Johns and the Red Curtain, third member David Gregory taking the nom de hoax Lord Cornelius Plum, and David's brother Ian-- E.I.E.I. Owen-- on drums. But some people believed the band was real, and that the records really had been dredged out of a warehouse after decades of neglect. Why not? Not only did the Dukes stick to period instruments and effects, not only did they wear paisley shirts and floppy felt hats to the studio, and not only were all the silly lyrics and psychedelic excesses forgivable, but the band is fantastically, blindly in love with its material. And the songwriting kills. The Dukes began as a joke, but this joke band's two albums rank with XTC's best. Quoting Partridge from definitive source Chalkhills.org: ""The Dukes were the band we all wanted to be in when we were at school: Purple, giggling, fuzztone, liquid, and arriving. If you want to know where those cheap charlatans 'The Beatles', 'Pink Floyd', 'The Byrds', 'The Hollies', and 'The Beach Boys' stole their ideas from, well just listen to this and weep."" But even though the homages are front and center, picking out influences is one of the dullest ways to dig these records; hearing these guys bathe in their boyhood record collections is the chief hook, followed by way they let their eyes bug out a little farther than on their ""proper"" albums of the time. XTC's Big Express and Skylarking came from a working band with adult problems and a grown-up's nostalgia; the Dukes have been like way out of it since high school. Still, picking out the influences on the two Dukes of Stratosphear records is a good music nut's game. Some are obvious: compared to Pink Floyd's subtler ""Arnold Layne"", Partridge's ""Have You Seen Jackie?"" throws a victory parade with acid-laced confetti for its crossdressing hero(ine); ""Pale and Precious"" apes Beach Boys harmonies years before everyone in Brooklyn was doing it. Other references are subtler or better mashed-up, but rarely is the source of the song the point. You don't have to know the Hollies to adore how perfectly Moulding crafted the melody of ""Vanishing Girl"", or the way he bites off the high notes on the chorus. And don't let the bits of gibberish and fluff-- like young Lily Fraser ""narrating"" Psionic Sunspot*--* distract from the inspired arrangements on each song, like the backwards autoharp on ""Have You Seen Jackie?"" Or the ""banana fingers piano"" on ""Braniac's Daughter"", or the didg's and fuzz pedals and sick guitars and harpsichords and drawkcab loops and sped-up singing, and at the end of ""Mole from the Ministry"" a backward voice actually says, ""you can fuck your atom bomb."" Hey, it was the times. Although I've been mixing up both of the albums in this review, there are marked differences between the debut EP and the career-ending LP. 25 O'Clock is more fun and more loyal to its sources; Psonic Psunspot has stronger songs, especially on the front half, but they're also not far removed from proper XTC material. (On Partridge's late-80s demo cassette, Jules Verne's Sketchbook, the demo for ""Little Lighthouse"" ain't the weirdest thing to come out of his home studio.) 25 O'Clock is quick and sneaky; Psonic is wilder, but ""The Affiliated"" wanders , with the Latin section arguably the weirdest thing on the whole set. The new reissues of each album add several demo recordings for value. Partridge's 80s demos are often essential; they mark the final resting place of some of the best material of his career. But these cuts aren't examples. ""Nicely Nicely Jane"" is barely a sketch of a song about a murderous girl, and ""Susan Revolving"" has a solid melody but falls in the ""too early to tell"" category. The discs also include the demos for most of the album tracks, and some of them are a surprise, like Partridge's ramshackle jam through ""Bike Ride to the Moon"" or the sewer nightmare guitar solo that leads us out of ""Little Lighthouse""-- not to mention Moulding's space-funk first draft of ""What in the World??"" The Dukes never gave a big, dramatic reason for breaking up. (Neither did XTC.) They just hung up their axes after Psonic Psunspot, shelving a concept for a rock opera called The Great Royal Jelly Scandal. But they did get in one reunion: the reissue of 25 O'Clock includes their 2003 charity recording ""Open a Can (of Human Beans)"", which pays tribute to nothing more obviously than 90s-era XTC. And it sounds oh so unfortunately grown-up.

Baby,Bosque Brown,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3545e6ef9596932060b/1:1/w_160/7d91d811.jpg,2009-04-01 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12867-baby/,Burnt Toast Vinyl,"Mara Lee Miller has the sort of voice that cannot help but to dominate a song, but that is not always for the best. All throughout Baby, her second full-length release under the name Bosque Brown, she comes across like Texas' answer to Portishead vocalist Beth Gibbons, with her cold, ghostly timbre wrapped up in a strong country twang that is as intriguingly incongruent as it is limited. Though her narrow, expressive range can yield some very moving moments in individual songs, it effectively paints her into an aesthetic corner, particularly as she insists upon singing over some extremely stark arrangements. Without the sort of textural and rhythmic options available to Gibbons' collaborators in Portishead, Miller's thin, tinny vocals are forced to the center of every cut on her album, resulting in an exhaustingly uniform style and tone. With only a few exceptions, Miller's songs are far better at suiting a pre-existing mood than evoking one, but that mood is somewhat hard to pin down. The record is most obviously influenced by the darker side of old-school country music, acoustic gospel, and traditional southern folk, but in its modern context, her work fits nicely alongside Cat Power, Scout Niblett, and Beth Orton. Even still, it's not easy to figure out the most ideal conditions to hear these songs. Whereas Chan Marshall's output can be divided into two basic categories-- the listen-intently-and-feel-her-pain recordings, and the music that can sit comfortably in the background during brunch-- Bosque Brown occupies the awkward no-man's land between those extremes, which has a way of making the record feel purposeless even when it communicates sincere, relatable emotions. While the songs on Baby essentially sound the same, they are not all of equal quality. Several of the selections feel somewhat directionless and insubstantial, though the majestic march ""Oh River"" and the heartbreaking album opener ""White Dove"" have immediately ingratiating melodies that emphasize the strengths of Miller's voice. ""This Town"", a relatively upbeat tune led by simple, jaunty piano chords is another highlight, and it mercifully adds a touch of levity in the midst of an otherwise dour and bleak set of tunes. It's not exactly a coincidence that the best songs on Baby happen to be the numbers that boast memorable instrumentation. Just over half the tracks on the album open with Miller's unaccompanied vocals, and most seem like compositions that were written a cappella, with guitars, pianos, and percussion added later on to fill out the sound. Left to her own devices, Miller's melodies tend to meander, but the fuller arrangements give them shape and power. ""Oh River"", the album's most successful piece, benefits greatly from dynamic drumming that gives Miller's voice a nice lift up into its chorus, allowing the entire song to crest dramatically along with her vocal part. This is a marked contrast with ""Texas Sun"", which conveys an appropriate sense of desolation but also sounds very much like a band lagging behind its singer as she goes off and does her own thing. It's difficult to listen to Baby without wondering if an undue amount of emphasis has been placed on the vocal performance. Too often Miller seems like a talented character actress who has somehow been cast in a lead role against type, and the very qualities that would make her charming and memorable in a smaller role become unflattering when exposed to too much spotlight.","Bosque singer Mara Lee Miller comes across like Texas' answer to Beth Gibbons, with her cold, ghostly timbre wrapped up in a strong country twang.

Dirty Bomb,Filastine,by: Mike Powell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fa13d19756521389af/1:1/w_160/6e5bce94.jpg,2009-04-01 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12796-dirty-bomb/,Soot,"Someone more eloquent than me-- DJ /rupture, actually-- said that while the internet has exposed a wide audience to non-Western music, it's exposed an even wider audience to Western music. Turn on the TV in the UAE and you can watch MTV Arabia, but turn on the radio in North America and the closest you get to Cairo is ""Big Pimpin'"". I don't bring this up as outcry, just context. I like ""Big Pimpin'"". Plenty. But in an idealized, all-inclusive, post-internet world, a record as diverse as Filastine's Dirty Bomb would feel central, and it doesn't-- it plays deep in the margins. Part of the problem-- if that's what you want to call it-- is that Filastine, a DJ and activist who spent most of his life in Seattle before relocating to Barcelona, is a self-conscious radical. Sampled voices heralding the destruction of bourgeois society and music as the weapon of the future don't sound revolutionary, they sound quaint-- the same  images of punk rock  co-opted for H&M or preserved on wall at the John Varvatos boutique on the Bowery, formerly CBGB's. Culture is a nuanced thing, and for Filastine to treat it like it isn't-- a clumsiness he avoids on  his blog-- is a little disappointing. Diversity isn't Filastine's strength, it's his cross to bear. He works over contemporary dance genres-- hip-hop, spiced-up rai, funk carioca, dubstep, dancehall-- like he's running down a checklist. What he might hear as global harmony I hear as forced multiculturalism. Some of his MC choices are great-- Rabah's low-pitched Arabic, for example, fits so snugly into the rumbling ""B'talla"" that I don't have to know the language to understand the flow. Other guests feel like obligations-- Wire MC and the Japanese ECD swing for the beat on ""Hungry Ghosts"" like blindfolded kids worlds away from their piñata, and it's hard to fight the feeling that Filastine didn't edit them out because then there'd be nobody to represent Japan and the bush. But Filastine's rhythmic instinct is awesome and delicate, and when he doesn't seem to be thinking too hard, he turns out hybrids so fluent they defy classification. ""Singularities"", for example, draws its beat from American hip-hop and its strings from Romani and gypsy records, but its hi-hats twist through a whole series of syncopations that don't call out any genre in particular. ""Hungry Ghosts"", which can be found unburdened by rappers on DJ /rupture's Uproot, borrows from crunk and dubstep but doesn't sound like either or, thank heavens, both. The beats on ""Fitnah"" morph and contort-- it's like an object whose shape changes depending on the angle you see it from. It embarrasses me to think that someone might hear Dirty Bomb as an ambassador for the genres it borrows from. If you like dancehall, buy a dancehall record. If you like rap, buy a rap record. While it's nice to envision Western acceptance of non-Western music, it's nicer to imagine the universe's collective ass jiggling sympathetically to the best moments on Dirty Bomb-- music so thoroughly uprooted that its traditions exist only as pivot points; fragments of sounds we know mashed together so intuitively that we barely recognize them.","Barcelona-via-Seattle DJ offers a diverse world-music inspired mix-- hip-hop, spiced-up rai, funk carioca, dubstep, dancehall-- that plays deep in the margins.

Beauties Never Die,Sissy Wish,by: Stephen M.

The pseudonym may initially evoke images of cardigan-clad musicians strumming playground-set songs, but Ålberg's music is anything but twee and naïve. Rather, the name Sissy Wish implies a combination of playfulness and wistfulness-- two qualities in good supply on Ålberg's third full-length. Originally released in Norway in 2007 and finally getting a U.S. release this spring, Beauties Never Die balances maturity and wonder as it takes a hard left turn away from the guitar-driven rock of the first two Sissy Wish albums. Instead, Ålberg and producer Jørgen Træn toy with computers, synths, and a few live instruments to animate these 10 inventive, diverse tracks. As such, the album shares some similarities with recent efforts by fellow Scandinavian dancing queens Annie and Sally Shapiro, but it sounds as though Ålberg has arrived at this new sound not through a well-stocked record collection or a thorough knowledge of pop history (although one expects she has both), but by giving full rein to all her personality quirks and musical curiosities. Ålberg has plenty of both. Her voice is high and pinched like Karen O's or Cyndi Lauper's, and she writes wordy songs full of unexpected hooks and lengthy melodic phrases, mixing exuberant shout-outs (""Do a rockabilly dance, baby take my hand!"") with quotable insights (""It takes a lifetime to find out if someone's happy to see you every day""). Ålberg even tapdances a solo on ""Ya Ya Ya"". Bolstering her charming eccentricities is an eclecticism that makes Beauties wide-ranging yet surprisingly cohesive, as if its emphasis on electronics has allowed her simultaneously to indulge and to give shape to her every whim. Each song has its own distinguishing sonic gesture: DIY girl-group drums add drama to that declaration-of-dedication title, ""Milk"" breaks for a steel drum solo, and ""Do What They Say"" revolves around the shouted dancefloor decree ""Do what they say!"" Doo-wop vocals and castanets lift the jumpy chorus of closer ""Book"", which may feature the album's most infectious hook. The wide range of styles evident on Beauties speaks less of someone trying to re-create the music of the past than re-imagining it in her own image. Beauties, however, proves most powerful when it's most quiet. The acoustic ""Music on the Radio"" may get lost among the synth starbursts during the first few listens, but its halting, tender chorus is the album's best showcase for her vocals and the call-and-response between piano and guitar on the bridge is its most fragile moment. It's ostensibly about the intimate connection between performer and listener, but as hushed as the song sounds, Ålberg promises to dance: ""I'd rather be dead than behave after what you'll be playing today,"" she sings teasingly.

Rules,The Whitest Boy Alive,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a327b1335d7bf169866c/1:1/w_160/d0658202.jpg,2009-04-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12830-rules/,Bubbles,"One of my favorite singles last year was Fred Falke's remix of the Whitest Boy Alive's ""Golden Cage"", a glossy, euphoric piece of electro-pop that mutated a gentle, unassuming disco comedown into a late-decade bookend to Daft Punk's ""Digital Love"". Yet despite the way Falke's remix brought out the best qualities of his syrupy, lonesome voice, Whitest Boy (and Kings of Convenience) head Erlend Øye is most comfortable when he's a bit subdued and quiet. And as much as massive house beats complement his vocals, he seems most at home when his musical surroundings undergo the same state of half-withdrawn restraint that he's in. Even in shifting from Kings of Convenience's acoustic pastoralism to the plugged-in, dance-friendly pop of the Whitest Boy Alive, Øye seemed like he was aiming not for bars or nightclubs, but the headphones of people walking down empty streets. The abandoned-dancefloor atmosphere of 2006's Dreams made TWBA a surprising side-project debut, but sophomore album Rules expands the mood just a little-- and, in the process, the sound gets a little more crowded. Where its predecessor let the rhythm breathe and gave most of the attention to Øye's sleepy murmur and his loudly echoing, desolate-sounding guitar, Rules pushes the beats just a bit more forward and has Øye's riffs sharing a tighter space with Daniel Nentwig's expanded, more prominent palette of synths and keyboards. It doesn't improve things any: With that much more emphasis placed on the backbeat and away from that bell-like guitar sound that made the original ""Golden Cage"" (or ""Figures"" or ""Borders"" from the debut) so haunting, the relatively upbeat moments sound a bit more like the brusque, arch Krautfunk of recent Fujiya & Miyagi. And while it seems like it'd be a good trade-off to have a version of Lightbulbs with a warmer-sounding vocalist and some actual human emotion, emphasizing the groove only reveals that bassist Marcin Oz and drummer Sebastian Maschat seem strangely hesitant about going full disco. As catchy as much of Rules is, that hesitancy brings about an imbalance of mood; tracks like ""Keep a Secret"", ""Courage"", and ""1517"" (the latter of which sounds oddly like a cocktail-funk tweak of Daft Punk's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"") ride on grooves that feel like they should be livelier than the subtly muffled bass and drumbeats that propel them, leaving the guitar to pick up the rhythmic slack. The songs frequently fall into an odd, twitchy no-man's land between unhurried minimalism and actual funk that the previous album was too relaxed to stumble into, though TWBA do pull themselves together enough for the more motorik ""Dead End"" and the slow-build faux-house crescendo of ""Island"" to step lively for real. It's more of a problem if you're expecting a straight-up dance album than an unassuming indie pop album, and if all you need's a warm pulse and a taut rhythm section-- and that chiming guitar, which still rings out often enough-- those moments are more than adequate. The points where Rules gets a little too mellow are where it goes from the vaguely compelling to the preciously cloying, i.e., the tropical torpor of ""Intentions"" and the Ambien-fueled headswim of ""Rollercoaster Ride"", which does less to evoke its lyrical conceit than it does a leisurely paddle-boat excursion. At least Øye still plays to his strengths. To be honest, a more vigorous backbeat might undermine much of the sentiment in Rules with his plaintive presence still running things, especially since whatever loneliness that was lost with the busier production has been compensated for lyrically. Sure, the subject matter's familiar-- infidelity between friends in ""Gravity"", the feeling of uncommunicative isolation in ""Island"", the difficulty of committing (""Courage"") and of ending that commitment (""Dead End""), but Øye sings them with a distinctly sugary melancholy that can't be mistaken for anyone else's voice. All that worn-down, flagging energy behind it is something that can at least be endured-- though at least the potential remixes could be interesting.","Kings of Convenience head Erlend Øye returns in his electro-pop guise with a slightly more warm and human album than this project's debut.

Crack the Skye,Mastodon,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35a5e6ef9596932061b/1:1/w_160/66678414.jpg,2009-04-01 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12872-crack-the-skye/,Reprise,"First off: Mastodon's album concepts are officially out of control. It's one thing to base an entire album on Herman Melville's Moby Dick, as the Atlanta band did on 2004's amazing Leviathan. But when you're making a record about a kid who experiments with astral travel and then goes through a wormhole and meets Rasputin and Rasputin enters his body to escape assassination, or something, you've pushed this whole thing way, way further than it needed to be pushed. I interviewed guitarist Bill Kelliher a couple of weeks back, and he sighed deeply before delving into the story, and it took him a good five minutes or so just to get through the thing. That's a bit much. But it doesn't particularly matter how wound-up and excruciating the band's album concepts might be as long as their music kicks as hard as it does. Mastodon's music never really settles into a locked-in groove. Instead, it skips and dives and wanders. When the band switches up time-signatures, something it does often, it's not to show off math-rock chops; it's to rip the rug out from under you, to keep you uncomfortable. Crack the Skye, the band's fourth album, stays in weirdly soft midtempo churn mode more than their previous albums do, but it never lingers. Instead, it delays the gratification of the band's gigantic sunward-screaming choruses just long enough to make you wonder if they're ever coming, which makes the release that much more overwhelming when it finally arrives. ""The Czar"", a four-part, 11-minute epic that's still only the second-longest song on the album, gargles and fumes and lurches for nearly three minutes before launching into its first glorious steamroller riffs. This band is playing with you. The seven songs on Crack the Skye stretch over about 50 minutes, an indulgent track-length average for any band not named Opeth. But Mastodon's odysseys never feel forced or pretentious. Even on 13-minute closer ""The Last Baron"", I never really notice the track length. Every riff and roar flows organically into the next until I'm totally lost in it; hard to imagine checking the time remaining on your iPod when things get like that. In a way, Mastodon operates something like prime-era Metallica, unleashing these huge, blistering tracks that journey over peaks and valleys and ditches and oceans before leaving you spinning. It's just that Mastodon's arsenal of weapons is different; instead of demi-classical guitar interludes and blazing twin-guitar leads and thuggish hey-hey-heys, they've got soupy quasi-jazz trundles and pigfuck distortion-explosions and quick bursts of time-honored Southern-rock melody. First single ""Divinations"" ranks among the best things the band's ever done, a quick banjo intro into a juddering riff that whips and soars through a serious full-speed attack of a song with one of the biggest, most cathartic choruses in the band's career, then dissolves into a space-surf solo before ending in a deeply satisfying thud. I just wish the band could've maintained that level of breathless intensity over the course of the full album, the way they did on Leviathan, still probably their best. On this one, they've broken with Leviathan/Blood Mountain producer Matt Bayles for Springsteen/Pearl Jam collaborator Brendan O'Brien. O'Brien doesn't drag them kicking and screaming onto active-rock radio or anything; this is still very much a Mastodon album, with all the blistering roar that phrase has come to imply. But this one doesn't have the expansive, suffusing grime of the previous two, and the band's churn can feel a bit stretched-thin for minutes at a time. Also, Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds are singing more than ever before, rather than delivering their mythologies in vein-popped grunts the way they once did. That's not a problem in itself, but Sanders and Hinds both sing in gurgly, nauseous whines that shoot for Ozzy territory but never quite get there. When they're harmonizing eerily deep in the mix, it works. When they get closer to the top, it sometimes doesn't. And so the most powerful moments on Crack the Skye are almost always the most direct. On the title track, Neurosis' Scott Kelly shows up for a lung-busting guest-vocal, bellowing over the din of the band's complex thunder-crunch while a demonic vocodered thing screeches out a counterpoint. And near the end, Kelly growls out the most serious lyric on the whole record: ""Momma, don't let them drag her down/ Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one."" And you remember something else the band has been saying in interviews. This isn't really the band's opus about astral travel or Rasputin or whatever; it's drummer and primary lyricist Brann Dailor's attempt to wrestle with his sister Skye's way-too-early death. If he has to conjure alternate universes to get there, it's easy to see why. And even at its most prog-tastic heights of absurdity, this band's wriggling thunder never falls apart. It just punches deeper when Mastodon drop their defenses.","Mastodon follow the amazing Leviathan/Blood Mountain 1-2 with a Brendan O'Brien-produced LP that mixes more rock and prog into their metal core.

Black Boy White Boy,Young Dro & Yung L.A.,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ed13d1975652138997/1:1/w_160/a0c64406.jpg,2009-03-31 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12785-black-boy-white-boy/,self-released,"Young Dro is an interesting case: a rapper who sounds more engaged and alive when he's rapping about his cars or diamonds than when he's dealing with more traditionally weighty subjects. His voice is a raw-throated, gravelly gargle, but it's all too easy to tell when he's smiling. And when he's comparing his cars to fruits or candies or Papa Smurf, he's absolutely in his element. On last year's I Am Legend mixtape, he bragged of a ""Benz coupe same color Ric Flair hair,"" probably the most ridiculously great car-color description I've ever heard. Dro's now nearly three years removed from ""Shoulder Lean"", his sole big hit, and he's not getting calls to jump on big-hit posse-cut remixes, the way he was when he wrecked the ""Top Back"" and ""We Fly High"" remixes a little while back. But last year, he scored something of a fluke regional hit when he spazzed out on the remix of his labelmate Yung L.A.'s ""Ain't I"", one of those effortlessly likable Southern synth-bangers where everyone involved miraculously seems to be operating at peak capacity. Over that twinkling beat, Dro's word-drunk exuberance beautifully offset L.A.'s hesitant chirpiness and label boss T.I.'s slick regality: ""Rims so big I'm at the tip-top, ain't I/ Choppers in the trunk'll make you do the macarena."" In a just world, that ""Ain't I"" remix would lead to big things starting to happen for Dro again. Instead, he's sharing equal mixtape billing with L.A., the worst rapper on his label by orders of magnitude, and delivering some of the most limp, unimpressive work of his young career. L.A. is this weird little creep with a squeaky baby-voice and a barely serviceable sense of meter who loves bragging about his shitty half-mohawk and his Urkel glasses. He barely drops one quotable line on this endless 76-minute tape, unless we're counting calling himself ""haircut boy"" like that's a good thing. Sharing space with this guy does Dro no favors. That's especially true because L.A. and Dro love doing these white-people voices that basically begin and end with Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, crowing ""Dude!"" and ""Rock!"" and ""Party time!"" over and over and over. They stay in character for entire songs here, and it completely drives me nuts. It's meant to be funny, of course, but beyond that goofy-ass cover, there's barely a chuckle in any of it. And even when he's not stooping to lame-ass comedy, Dro really indulges all his worst impulses here. On ""Shower"", he raps for the ladies with all the cool seductiveness of a lunch table full of eighth-grade dudes: ""We could do it in the shower, get it wet then/ After that, we could go and have sex then."" On ""Still Selling Drugs"", he flips Akon's cheesed-out Euro-dance hit ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"" so it's about cocaine, and the three minutes he devotes to it feel endless. Over and over, he sings his own choruses, which is really something he shouldn't do. Even on autopilot, Dro's delivery still has serious charm. And here and there, he shows flashes of his old inventiveness: ""Young shooter, in the Chevy with Punky Brewster."" But it's tough to calculate how much urgency and joy has gone out of Dro since he made I Am Legend just a year ago. It's not the worst thing in the world that he's teamed up with a terrible rapper here. But every time we hear a genuine star's voice on B**lack Boy White Boy (T.I., say, or Lil Boosie), Dro just sounds almost as lost as L.A. I really, really hope this guy finds it in himself to pull it together. The world needs more rappers willing to compare their Ferraris to the nose on Rudolph.","Young Dro is an interesting case: An MC who sounds more engaged and alive when he's rapping about his cars than when he's dealing with more weighty subjects.

A New Tide,Gomez,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fb5e6ef95969320547/1:1/w_160/34de1d8e.jpeg,2009-03-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12797-a-new-tide/,ATO,"Like mad scientists, Gomez have been trying to concoct a hybrid of Britpop and American roots music for more than a decade now, to varying degrees of success. Their debut, Bring It On, which beat out Pulp's This Is Hardcore and Cornershop's When I Was Born for the 7th Time for the 1998 Mercury Prize, seemingly set a blueprint for future experimentation with a shaggy-haired combination that sounded raw yet ambitious, unforced yet focused. On their too-quick follow-up, 1999's Liquid Skin, Gomez buffed away most of the rough edges and derived a glossier, showier sound. They had lost the plot: The band was supposed to take over the world, not continue tinkering in the lab. In the meantime, that sophomore album has become Gomez's default setting: Even when they pushed reset on 2004's Split the Difference, their first collaboration with an outside producer, they couldn't escape the slick elements that were beginning to appear intrinsic to the project all along. A New Tide, their sixth studio album, promises yet another reinvigorated approach, but that title is about as far as they get. For a band with more than a decade under its belt, Gomez still seem to be working with a simple formula that applies studio sheen to rustic music-- or maybe it's rustic elements to studio rock. ""Little Pieces"" threads blues guitar riffs throughout an otherwise anonymous rocker, and ""Other Plans"" devolves into a vague raga jam with Beatlesque backward loops. ""Boned Tired"" mixes acoustic guitar and mouth harp with electronic hums and beats. It's actually a pretty neat trick that reveals the sonic similarities between the new and the traditional, the organic and the synthetic, but it still sounds like a trick. The electronic elements here pop up so surreptitiously that that they come off like shorthand for innovative rather than innovation itself. There are, especially toward the end of A New Tide, some nice moments that show a potentially compelling band behind the transatlantic formula. A buoyant organ theme mingles with an upright bass on the whirling dervish ""If I Ask You Nicely"", and ""Natural Reaction"" catches a breeze with its windblown hook, chiming marimba, and clattering outro. ""Airstream Driver"" rockets along on a catchy hook and a quick tempo that makes it ideal for a road-trip mixtape, but it eventually devolves, as most Gomez songs do, into a coda jam that's heavy on rumbling bass but low on gas. The band has always taken liberties with conventional song structures, and that's one of the reasons their 2005 double-live Out West holds up surprisingly well. They take no small joy in defying expectations, in baiting and switching, in playing around with genres and instruments, if not necessarily with formulas. But on A New Tide, the abrupt tempo changes and style shifts no longer sound subversive or even very much fun, but overthought and perhaps even obligatory. It's a showy album with very little to show.","Still going, still actually very popular, these UK Ameriphiles promise yet another reinvigorated approach with this LP title.

Soundboy's Gravestone Gets Desecrated By Vandals,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30bc0084474cd0c01b0/1:1/w_160/fff344a3.jpg,2009-03-31 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12811-soundboys-gravestone-gets-desecrated-by-vandals/,Skull Disco,"Stripping away the glossy hooks of UK garage for a return to dark jungle's all-or-nothing intensity, dubstep's raison d'être was a low-end that damn near suffocated those dancers just looking for fun night out. And few artists took the genre's alienating torpor further than the Skull Disco crew. Shackleton, Appleblim, and their associates made ""dance"" music for the lost-looking souls poured into ratty couches at the back of the club, hypnotized by the speaker cones bulging in and out. Tense and clammy, the minimalist hand percussion and bloodcurdling drones on Skull Disco releases could give you the cold sweats on a sunny day. But by the time Ricardo Villalobos stretched Shackleton's ""Blood on My Hands"" into the spookiest dance single of the decade in 2007, just two years after the label formed, Skull Disco could offer little in the way of surprise. Repetition was diluting the sound's effectiveness: Another tribal drum pattern topped with a lunatic spoken word sample? Perhaps that's why, late last year, Skull Disco shuttered. Listening to Soundboy's Gravestone Gets Desecrated By Vandals, the second and final Skull Disco CD compilation following 2007's Soundboy Punishments, closing up shop was a wise decision on Shackleton and Appleblim's part. Only self-parody could result from another half-dozen singles in a similar vein. Split into one CD of original tunes and one CD of remixes from international contemporaries like Pole and Bass Clef, Soundboy's Gravestone offers more of the same, arriving in stores just before fanboy boredom turns to irritation. Disc One remains an excellent soundtrack for a slush-choked, bitter winter where economic conditions have turned the most outgoing club rats into hermits out of necessity. For those who've sampled Skull Disco's wares before and worry another nine tracks might be superfluous, one new development is that the kinship with non-dubsteppers feels more pronounced. Appleblim and Peverelist's ""Circling"" softens dubstep's bass wobble and clunky drums with synth sweeps from the early days of Euro dub-techno, while the micro-edited drums on Shackleton's ""You Bring Me Down"" owe more to post-gitch German wizards than they do to any UK sampler hero rearranging breakbeats. As for Disc Two, it may seem perverse given my earlier kvetching about the label's diminishing returns, but the remixes that abandon the label's gloom-sodden mood are usually the least effective, like Brendon Møller's attempt to turn Appleblim and Peverelist's ""Over Here"" into full-on Force Tracks-style Euro-house, complete with an undistinguished 4/4 beat. Meanwhile the best remixes offer welcome tweaks from those outside the dubstep scene without completely smothering the S.D. vibe. Pole's take on Shackleton's ""Shortwave"" retains the original's hypnotic quality while the always dub-friendly Stefan Betke strips the groove to the faintest skitter-pulse and splices the background hum into his usual chunks of reverb-heavy grit. While you can admire Skull Disco's integrity in deciding to mothball the whole operation rather than dilute their vision, tracks like the ""Shortwave"" remix make you wonder if the label couldn't have productively mutated in perpetuity.","Split into one CD of original tunes and one CD of remixes, the latest set of Skull Disco's dubstep retains the label's now-identifiable sound.

Now We Can See,The Thermals,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35eea9e61561daa4c6c/1:1/w_160/aac8b388.jpg,2009-03-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12875-now-we-can-see/,Kill Rock Stars,"With an economical use of language, a keen sense of the rhythms of repetition, and a sly, unobtrusive way with the reoccurring images that interest him (the sea, eyes/vision, the earth), the Thermals' Hutch Harris has always been able to ponder life's big questions without being ponderous. It helps that his words are always set against such sublimely sloppy pop riffs. But on Now We Can See, his band's fourth full-length, he takes advantage of a newfound musical maturity, buffing his fuzzy riffs into polished power-pop, which finally casts a much-deserved spotlight on his lyrics. When last we head from the Portland trio, they were down a member-- newbie drummer Westin Glass has since stepped behind the kit, though it is not his time-keeping that you hear on Now We Can See-- and hot off the acclaim of The Body, The Blood, The Machine, their scathing indictment of life in Christian theocracy, one of the more time capsule-worthy records of the Bush administration. So how does a poppy punk band follow up such a feat in the cautiously optimistic early days of the Obama administration? After proving they could take on ""topics that matter"" while maintaining their thrilling musical simplicity, it would have been a disappointment to see them revert to the gleefully grimy garage-punk of their early albums, on which Harris simply used his lyrical prowess to breathlessly catalog sexual power struggles. But not only does our new president mean that we have (hopefully) outgrown the need for an album like TBTBTM, but the band is also too joyously silly and powerfully spazzy to get stuck solely in the often dowdy realm of ""important"" political songwriting. The compromise, then, is Now We Can See, a concept album of sorts from the perspective of the dead that acts as a denouement to the last Thermals' record. It's an album that looks at life not as something to urgently struggle through, but as something that has already passed, something that our narrator finally has some perspective on. And this is why Harris is such an admirable songwriting talent: He writes about universal subjects with a sharply specific eye, and he has the imagination to transcend his own point of view to write from a character's perspective that there's no way he could share. Cramming in as many syllables as his thrifty, tightly coiled melodies will allow, Harris announces the collection's themes and tone with album opener ""When I Died"", singing, ""Busted and wrecked/ Justly infected/ My body beyond repair/ Had no objection, sir/ My only questions were/ 'Where do I go and will I know when I'm there?'/ But I really couldn't say that I cared."" Now We Can See is full of the regret you would expect from the recently deceased, but it's also rife with acceptance and relief. For every track like ""We Were Sick"", the incendiary, three-chord rant against the selfishness of the living and our indifference and contribution to the ecological crisis, there's a track like ""I Let It Go"", which is practically giddy in its liberation, celebrating the release of death. Now We Can See is bursting with clear-headed explorations of the ways that fear and neuroses hold us back from truly living (as on ""When I Was Afraid""), winkingly clinical examinations of the rote machinations that consume our lives (like ""Liquid In, Liquid Out""), and tales of the savagery at the basis of modern existence (like the title track or ""When We Were Alive""). Maybe these are pretty heady topics after all.","Here the Thermals buff their fuzzy riffs into polished power-pop, which casts a much-deserved spotlight on Hutch Harris' keen lyrics.

Living Thing,Peter Bjorn and John,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35d9d034d5c69bf2de0/1:1/w_160/0dfa6d38.jpg,2009-03-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12874-living-thing/,WichitaAlmost Gold,"It was the whistle heard around the world. You heard Peter Bjorn and John's breakthrough single ""Young Folks"" on ""Grey's Anatomy"". You heard it on the in-house muzak system while waiting in line to order at McDonald's. You heard it every time your co-worker in a neighboring cubicle deigned to whistle while they worked. But while making their unwitting entry into the North American mainstream with 2006's Writer's Block, the Swedish trio of Peter Morén, Björn Yttling, and John Eriksson used their busy interview schedule to talk up far less populist inspirations: the minimalist post-punk of Young Marble Giants, the rhythmic jazz of the Ethiopiques series, and other Other Music-recommended curios. That this follow-up album bears more pronounced nods to PB&J's left-field and international influences could easily be interpreted as a reactionary riposte to their sudden pop success (also known as ""pulling an In Utero""). But it also constitutes a perfectly logical next step in a career that's seen the band quickly evolve from a traditional Beatlesque retro-rock trio to adventurous producers of cosmopolitan pop music on Writer's Block. The deconstructionist ethic of Living Thing comes as even less of a surprise when you consider how the band's interim activities have played to the extremities of their sound: There was a digital-only album of texturally rich instrumentals (last year's Seaside Rock) and a stripped-down acoustic solo album from de facto frontman Morén, while Yttling became the go-to producer for veteran acts looking for some extra pop polish (Primal Scream). However, the fact that an album like Living Thing was to be expected from Peter Bjorn and John doesn't make it feel like any less of a letdown. You could call Living Thing PB&J's companion to super-fan Kanye West's 808 and Heartbreaks, where a deliberate over-reliance on drum-machine beats and bleats is exploited to illustrate the emotional unrest and stagnation conveyed in the lyrics. The tension peaks early on with Morén's ""It Don't Move Me"", a diatribe against sentimentalism ostensibly directed at an ex-lover (""forget photos and letters... you don't move me no more""), but which could easily be about his band's own ubiquity-- it can't be a coincidence that the song plays like a virtual rewrite of ""Young Folks"" (ascending chorus and all) but with the bongos and whistles relinquished in favor of a hand-clapped electro-funk backing track and deep piano tones. However, if PB&J are committed to keep moving forward, they're doing so at a snail's pace-- whether it's the oversold optimism of Eriksson's twee-pop opener ""The Feeling"" or Yttling's half-baked stoner-rock dirge ""I'm Losing My Mind"", the sense of ennui and longing they're trying to express is all too accurately reflected by sputtering rhythms that rarely gain any traction or momentum. The skeletal production is in turn matched by nursery-rhyme hooks that tenuously toe the line between endearingly naïve and amateurishly underdeveloped: The shantytown chant of ""Nothing to Worry About"" finds PB&J ably adapting to a post-""Paper Planes"" pop landscape, but its clunky chorus line (""Do this thing/ This type of thing/ Put a little money in this type of thing"") feels too self-consciously vague to make you want to join the song's kiddie choir. Likewise, the garish provocations of ""Lay It Down"" (""Hey, shut the fuck up, boy/ You are starting to piss me off"") clash awkwardly with the song's congenial snap-along sway. And when the band settles nicely into the relaxed juju groove of the title track, it forgets to write a proper chorus-- so it just crams in a hurried rewrite of the one featured in the superior ELO song of the same name. Not surprisingly, Living Thing fares best when the songs don't draw too much attention to their simplicity and lay off the gimmickry: the late-1980s U2/Gabriel slow burn of ""Just the Past"" (complete with lighter-waving fade-out); the tropical doo wop of ""Stay This Way""; the Kraftwerkian post-coital glow of closer ""Last Night"". But there's a noticeable deficit of swoon-worthy climaxes to complement these meditative turns. Compared to the widescreen splendor of Writer's Block, Living Thing sounds like a noble but flawed attempt by Peter Bjorn and John to test the fortitude of their songwriting using the most barren and broken of arrangements. But more often that not, it sounds like they settled on the drum-machine presets first, with the lyrics and melodies thrown on top as afterthoughts. After hearing Yttling repeatedly declare, ""I'm losing my mind/ That's why I ain't fine"" for the umpteenth time, it's hard to shake the nagging feeling that Peter Bjorn and John applied the Writer's Block title to the wrong album.","The Swedish trio follows its newfound pop success with more pronounced nods to left-field and international influences.

Dirtbox EP / When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence,Harmonic 313,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c25e6ef959693204bc/1:1/w_160/8130c807.jpg,2009-03-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12752-dirtbox-ep-when-machines-exceed-human-intelligence/,Warp,"Ever hear Dick Hyman's cover of James Brown's ""Give It Up or Turnit a Loose""? It came out in 1969, a year after Wendy (nee Walter) Carlos' Switched-On Bach sold half a million copies and turned the Moog into a must-have instrument for musicians everywhere. Listening to Hyman's reinterpretation of one of Brown's heaviest funk tracks is a weird experience: The first time or two, it almost-- almost-- sounds like an accidental precursor to the late-1990s Timbaland/Neptunes approach to digital hip-hop production, at least in the same way a '32 Ford could be considered a precursor to the Lamborghini Countach. Then the novelty wears off to the point where the rinky-dink bassline and the exasperated robot mosquito substituting for James Brown's vocals sound astonishingly cheap and frivolous. Once the 70s came, with their ""Flash Light"" and their ""I Feel Love"" and their ""Trans-Europe Express"", dance music had finally found out how to play to the synthesizer's strengths, and those old cover albums from the Moog's growing-pain years sounded like relics. But apparently the shift away from the tinny flimsiness of early synthesizers wasn't a point of no return: someone up and made himself a Switched-On Dilla. That someone is Mark Pritchard, who split off his gig in retro-minded exotica-breaks peddlers Harmonic 33, dropped a ""1"" in the middle of that number in a nod to Detroit's area code, and put together a body of work that passes the modern Motor City hip-hop sound through an orange plastic filter that smells kind of like burning diodes. There's a slight cheapness hidden beneath all the bass he likes to smother his beats under: The rhythms usually feel like they click all right, sometimes an intriguing half-melodic drone will seep up through the murk, and you can almost grasp the weighty, body-moving funk that rolls along the basslines-- but the further the track goes on, the more you can feel it start to decay under the strain of a limited sonic palette. That limitation comes from the self-consciously vintage-sounding Moog bleeps and blurps Pritchard toys with over the course of Harmonic 313's Dirtbox EP and the follow-up full-length, When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence. That style has a certain whimsical charm to it, but imagine if you had to put together a handful of instrumental hip-hop tracks relying mostly on the same equipment that Hot Butter used for ""Popcorn"". ""Dirtbox"", which kicks off both the EP and the album, is a subwoofer-eviscerating monster of a track, and the second track on the EP, ""Arc Light"", succeeds with its glowing bass and hypnotically locomotive drum breaks where lesser Jay Dee-alikes have failed. But the other two tracks on the EP sound either half-finished (stripped-down, trudging bleep breaks on ""The Returners"") or shaky-footed (""Wobbz"", which sounds like a comedy dubstep military march through a swamp made of Nerf). When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence maintains that approach, for better or for otherwise, and crashes into a bridge abutment when it tries to go beyond it. There's still a surplus of tracks that pit towering, seismic basslines against needling, crumbling old turn-of-the-70s synths-- waxing vaguely sinister and modestly head-nod-worthy in the stagger-step ""Cyclotron"", galumphing along to the accompaniment of a mid-seizure Speak & Spell on ""Word Problems"", and stomping brusquely towards interstellar dub oblivion on ""Call to Arms"". And even if some of that movement feels like jogging in place, better those than the woozy, somewhat nauseated-sounding Aphex Twin/Boards of Canada manqué moments like ""Galag-A"" and ""Köln""-- not to mention the acid casualty ""Flaash"", which feels like getting stabbed and/or bludgeoned to death with a rusty 303. But no amount of boulder-sized low-end can disguise the fact that, even when these tracks work, they usually feel like they're missing something major. And that something is a vocalist. The beat to ""Battlestar""-- which consists of some sturdy neo-boom-bap drums and not a whole lot else-- might not be the most audacious on the album, but with top-notch Detroiters Phat Kat and Elzhi dropping lyrical gems over it, it's one of the most alive-sounding. ""Falling Away"", the other vocal showcase, features an ethereally raspy and robotic-sounding turn from Steve Spacek... and damn, this is a good production style, ain't it? The fact that Pritchard tried to let his Harmonic 313 beats stand alone is a shame, since their greatest drawbacks-- their repetitive entropy and their unsubtle bombast-- could be easily offset by a good, strong cast of MCs and singers. We're gonna run out of Dilla beats eventually, so the first mixtape guru to drop some unheard Pharoahe Monch or Erykah Badu a cappellas over ""Cyclotron"" instead of ""Geek Down"" for the hundredth time will really have something.","Australian producer filters the modern Motor City hip-hop sound through textures associated with vintage electronic devices.

Vignetting the Compost,Bibio,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f7ea9e61561daa4b90/1:1/w_160/161fa26c.jpeg,2009-03-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12793-vignetting-the-compost/,Mush,"On each successive album of electro-acoustic collages, Stephen Wilkinson (aka Bibio) has taken a hesitant step toward traditional songcraft. His debut, Fi, was full of fragments and wisps; it displayed his signature blend of quaint English folk and Boards of Canada-style electronics at its most elemental and transient. Hand Cranked featured the first appearance of his timorous voice and more consistent track lengths; music that seemed about folk moved a notch closer to being folk. And Vignetting the Compost features more singing, more orderly structure, and more unvarnished melody than ever before. On some of these songs, Bibio would only have to break up the rigidity of his loops and lose a few sound effects to actually turn into Bert Jansch. But this is just evidence of a gradual slide to the right on the electro-acoustic spectrum. The constants of Bibio's music remain intact. There is his characteristic naturalism: Birdsong and a stream serve an overture for ""Weekend Wildfire""; birds nest in the staticky thickets that close out ""Thatched"". There is his twanging acoustic guitar, which is the fundamental element of many of his sun-streaked idylls-- sometimes, now, appearing almost unadorned, as on ""Mr. & Mrs. Compost"". And there is the frequent sense of hearing everything through a wobbly old phonograph. This effect is particularly pronounced now that Bibio's guitar parts have grown so robust, giving it more surface to cling to. It's a technique he uses to various ends-- it renders ""Flesh Rots, Pip Sown"" warm and nostalgic, like aged film; elsewhere, as on ""Torn Under the Window Light"", it sounds ethereal, even sinister. It's no stretch to say that Vignetting the Compost features some of Bibio's finest music to date; the vocals, however, are more of a mixed bag. Wilkinson has a thin, modest voice that verges on anonymity. This can actually be a plus when he uses it as a sound element among others, as it slips unassumingly into the compositions while evoking the workmanlike singing of non-commoditized folk music. It works well as a reverb-drenched postscript to ""Flesh Rots"", but it's less interesting as a focal point on ""Mr. & Mrs. Compost"" and ""Great are the Piths"". All of this risks overstating the case: The vocals don't show up that frequently, and are seldom worse than distracting when they do. Bibio spends the bulk of the album fiddling with gleaming, ghosting sounds that evade such easy characterization. It's just a slightly unsettling tendency-- you get the impression that maybe Wilkinson secretly pines to be an unreconstructed folkie, and has been using electronics as sort of smoke screen that he's clearing away as he gains confidence. The problem here is that while he's a quite interesting electro-folk musician, there is evidence that he's merely capable as a straight-up folk singer. One worries that this is a distraction from what he does well, like hanging reversed trills on the tranquil arpeggios of ""Dopplerton"" or making guitar strings chirp like birds on ""Everglad Everglade""-- this is where his unique musical personality shines through. If he does wind up going all Fairport Convention on us, it'll be like Joaquin Phoenix deciding to be a rapper-- more power to him, but what a waste!","Beginning in the orbit of Boards of Canada, Stephen Wilkinson has taken his guitar and woozy effects further in the direction of trad song-based British folk.

Bloomed / The Hill / Impasse,Richard Buckner,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31bb1335d7bf1698650/1:1/w_160/0678e3b4.jpg,2009-03-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12822-bloomed-the-hill-impasse/,Merge,"On his most recent albums, Dents and Shells and Meadow, Richard Buckner minted a mature style that can be understood, in various ways, as enveloping. Whether taking on folk, power-pop, country, rock, or gently experimental drones, he produces uniformly gleaming, misty enigmas. He intones elusive lyrics in a smeared voice, artfully skirting the subject. We see windows and phones, highways and fields, charged with potency like crime scene photos. Mercurial, emotional abstractions stand in for stories, rendered with the telegraphic flicker of dreams, and flat, unmoored syntax in search of some missing referent. The music is translucent and pervasive, gathering like twilight. Buckner's pointedly elliptical style is so refined that it suggests disembodiment, as if he'd simply atomized himself into song. With these reissues of three earlier, out-of-print albums, Merge reintroduces to us a more Earth-bound Buckner-- not to mention some of his most beloved tunes. All three are seeded with the idiosyncrasies that would increase in his music over time, and they clarify his developmental through-line from Bloomed to Meadow: His songwriting skewed toward sturdy or ephemeral extremes; his lyrics floated into the ether; his music thickened up, leveled out, and rolled over him like a wave. In 1994, Buckner made his solo debut as a mysteriously bent country musician. At the time, he was living in San Francisco and getting nowhere with his band, the Doubters. He decamped for Lubbock, Tex., to record Bloomed with Lloyd Maines. A sense of urgency simply to get the songs out attends the album's loose, impassioned performances and pithy arrangements-- most highlight vocals and acoustic guitar, sometimes with minimal percussion, electric guitar, or strings. In some ways, it's a traditional outsider-country record in the lineage of Townes Van Zandt. Buckner's voice is all honey and oak, his guitar style elaborately twanging, his constant subject matter heartache. The past tense of the title is not rhetorical: He spins webs of memories, confessions, and creeds around the moment the bloom came off. But already, there are signs that Buckner is not your average country singer. His phrasing is distinctly off-kilter, speeding up and slowing down, getting louder and softer, pinching and soaring according to the cadence of inspiration. The narrative lines frequently white out, go hazy. This is a world where phones ""pour blue,"" where ""never"" has a sound and ""lust"" a taste. And the songs are difficult to frame with pat emotions-- they're alloyed and moody, like weather. On the indelible ""Rainsquall"" he equivocates, ""And when the blue breaks through/ Honey, I'll still want you/ And when the storm moves on/ Dear, I might be gone."" On choruses his broad croon often slips into compact melisma, stacking stridencies and sonorities in tight, beveled packets. Spanish guitar runs spurt out of nowhere. Overall, the music seems modeled upon campfires, guttering and glowing according to vagaries of the wind. Tucked near the end of Bloomed is ""Emma"", a rare story-song amid all the painterly abstraction. It shows off Buckner's gift for sharp, mythologizing characterization straight out of Cormac McCarthy: A young bride runs from a ""black-hatted man with a weed in his mouth"" unleashed by her spurned husband, a ""Cherokee City man with cold, cruel hands and jealous eyes."" This sort of character-driven song comes to the fore on The Hill, which is based on Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology, a series of soliloquies delivered by the dead citizens of a semi-fictional town. In 1996, Buckner recorded The Hill while taking a break from recording Devotion + Doubt, but didn't do anything with it until the tape surfaced in his truck four years later. With a guitar, an E-bow, and a keyboard, he entered the studio with Calexico's Joey Burns and John Convertino, but forbade them any traditional percussion. Burns played cello, and Convertino improvised percussion from things around the studio. The resultant music is raucous and immediate, with many chorus-less songs abruptly slamming into one another, yet the songs feel more rigorously interpreted than on the meandering Bloomed. The sound is thicker, more assertive. Chiming, well-built pop-rock arrangements, coasting keyboards, and hard-bitten blues unknot Buckner's writing, and the vocal melodies are expressed less erratically. It works best as a formal exercise, as he winds up subjugating some of his tics to the form-- in this context, his lyrics are naturally less impressionistic-- and the numerous, interstitial instrumentals mean we get fewer actual songs. (These instrumentals include a droney opening piece that predicts later efforts like ""Charmers"".) It's less essential than Bloomed, but contains some full-bodied Buckner classics like ""Elizabeth Childers"" and ""Johnnie Sayre"". 2002's Impasse is the most immediately accessible record of the bunch, combining the lucid, energetic arrangements of The Hill with the arcane personal lyricism of Bloomed. Opener ""Grace-I'd-Said-I'd-Known"" resounds with Bucknerisms: the humbly majestic acoustic guitar strumming in, the weary fanfare of the singing, the lyrics describing the symptoms of an unnamed-- perhaps unnamable-- ache. Each song is titled by its own first line, making the tracklist an impromptu poem that demonstrates how Buckner's lyrics are at once self-sufficient and infinitely interchangeable: Seldom has he written a line that doesn't address itself to a fundamental sense of lapsed grace. If it's not as revelatory as Bloomed, it's just as enjoyable, and represents our last glimpse of early Buckner, at the peak of his pop-rock powers, before he slipped behind the seductive veils of Dents and Shells and Meadow, which, like Bloomed, could be only his.","With reissues of three early, out-of-print albums, Merge reintroduces us to some of Richard Buckner's songs.

Bunny Gets Paid [Deluxe Edition],Red Red Meat,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a358b1335d7bf16986f0/1:1/w_160/f451e0a4.jpg,2009-03-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12871-bunny-gets-paid-deluxe-edition/,Sub PopSub Pop,"From one angle, you could view Chicago's Red Red Meat as 1990s also-rans. When the alternative nation was in full swing, they toured with mega-popular grunge bands and they were acquainted with flannel shirts and threadbare jeans. They were on the cusp of a breakthrough, but it never quite worked out. Instead, Red Red Meat got weirder as they went, experimenting with production and structure until they became more or less a cult act, and then they disintegrated. They're remembered now for being a predecessor to Califone, the rootsier outfit started by frontman Tim Rutili, which would eventually include contributions from everyone in the final incarnation of RRM. But maybe that'll change. Sub Pop has reissued the 1995 album Bunny Gets Paid, arguably the band's high-water mark, in a deluxe edition with a bonus disc, and 14 years on, it's aged beautifully. Like many of their contemporaries, Red Red Meat took the foundations of 60s and 70s rock-- blues, heavy guitars, an unapologetic focus on riffs-- and re-shaped them for a more self-aware post-punk context. Their self-titled 1992 debut was speedy and abrasive blues-punk, the kind of stuff that was slotted with the art-damaged classic rockisms of Royal Trux and Pussy Galore. 1994's Jimmywine Majestic, their first full-length for Sub Pop, was more refined; its songs were slowed enough to let the groove seep through and recorded clearly enough to allow the melodies to catch some light. It was around the time of Jimmywine that RRM became an emerging figure on the grunge landscape, when they hit the road with hometown pals Smashing Pumpkins during the latter's Siamese Dream tour. But Bunny Gets Paid took them in a direction that left the possibility of mainstream recognition behind. With Bunny, all of a sudden Red Red Meat seemed artier, more hidden and inscrutable. Rutili has always spoken in riddles, content to braid together phrases or even single words that sound pleasing to the ear, but here the fragmentation became more extreme. Somehow, when the syllables pile up and the flow of vowels and consonants rides the arc of the music, the effect could be sublime. ""Mink-eyed, marble-eyed/ In the gauze, in the weeds/ By the drain, red on pale/ There's a nail by the vent,"" goes the chorus of ""Gauze"", Bunny Gets Paid's stone classic and a contender for the best song Rutili has written. Who knows what it means. But if you can picture a scrubby patch of weeds and in it a clump of gauze, possibly soiled, twitching in the breeze, and the disconnected image of decay stirs something in you, you're on your way to falling in love with Red Red Meat. But make no mistake: You don't need to know what Rutili is singing about to enjoy Bunny Gets Paid, an album you feel as much as listen to. The vocals are buried and the lyrics enigmatic, but the songs still communicate in a direct and visceral way. Much of the record swings between two poles that seem different on the surface but are closely related the more you listen. On one side is weary resignation, the sense of feeling beaten down and bombed-out and hollow while still managing to take in the surreal stream of images happening around you. Here there's lots of space, acoustic instruments, thudding drums beaten slowly with mallets. The opening ""Carpet of Horses"" is perhaps the most Califone-like song here, with its buzzing acoustic guitar being stabbed with a slide, someone coughing in the background, and a gurgle of electronic noises suggesting a wounded machine on its last legs. And then the mood changes. ""Carpet of Horses"" is like a heavy door creaking open and you can't quite make out what's behind it, but ""Chain Chain Chain"" follows and reveals Bunny's other extreme. It's the explosion of energy after a week in bed, a rocker with a chunky riff and the kind of elegantly simple blues-inflected hook that the Stones would have been thrilled to write at any point between 1968 and 1972. It swaggers, even dances a bit, confident in the leveling power of its heavy stomp, but even here everything is delivered with a slight twist. Rutili still hangs back, his voice obscured as he sings quietly and close to the mic, unaware or unwilling to acknowledge that this should by all rights by the band's breakout single. And then ""Rosewood, Wax, Voltz + Glitter"" is just as catchy, but louder, meaner, more chaotic, with shrieking, trebly guitars and the sound of glass being smashed in the background. Another swing, and wasted ballad ""Buttered"" drops us back to where we started, alone in a dark room somewhere. That smashing glass on ""Rosewood"" reinforces how much the odd little production touches throughout contribute to the album's feel. Most of Bunny was recorded and mixed by Brad Wood, with Casey Rice, Keith Cleversly, and band member Brian Deck contributing. Deck would go on to join Rutili in Califone and would also become a producer of note in this decade, and Bunny Gets Paid is the album at the root of his organic, rusted-out junk-shop orchestra aesthetic. It's a busy mix of sounds that can be dense and loud or open and airy, depending on the needs of the song. The throb of electronics mixes easily with the slackly-tuned acoustic guitars, managing to sound both old and futuristic and the same time, while the constant use of distortion and feedback as coloring drapes the whole album in a hazy, narcotic light. The bonus disc is useful mostly for seeing how songs developed and production techniques evolved. We get Rutili's 4-track acoustic demo of ""Chain Chain Chain"", which is dark and spare with only hints at the cathartic song it would become. A few songs are heard in different configurations, like ""Idiot Son"", in a mellower earlier take that was released as a 7"", and ""Carpet of Horses"", given a grittier rock arrangement. ""Mouse-ish (Dub Mix)"" is notable for making explicit what had always seemed obvious-- the influence of dub production techniques on Red Red Meat's sound (which would continue in earnest on the first couple of Califone EPs). It's interesting stuff for people who have the original record memorized-- the bonus disc as study guide-- but less than essential for everyone else. For all its mystery and ambiguity, the long strings of cracked images and dream-like sonic mist that linger in the air, Bunny Gets Paid ends with the most direct statement of Red Red Meat's existence. The closing song is a downcast but still hopeful cover of ""There's Always Tomorrow"", the love theme from the stop-motion animated ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" TV special, and after what's come before, the folksy rainbow-chasing sentiment feels earned. It eases you back into the real world and drives home something essential about the record you just heard, which you realized on some level but hadn't quite put a finger on: It's got a huge heart.","Sub Pop reissues the proto-Califone band's high-water mark, in a deluxe edition with a bonus disc, and 14 years on, it's aged beautifully.

A Woman a Man Walked By,PJ HarveyJohn Parish,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a357ea9e61561daa4c5f/1:1/w_160/ada10af9.jpg,2009-03-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12870-a-woman-a-man-walked-by/,IslandInterscope,"Polly Jean Harvey isn't exactly a restless creative spirit, given the consistency of her themes and the familiar emotional landscape of her songs. Nevertheless, she's been changing things up from the very beginning, starting with the shift from her near-perfect debut Dry to the bone-rattling game-changer Rid of Me and on through any other number of career zigs and zags, some more successful than others. Since disbanding her original trio, but especially since her breakout To Bring You My Love, Harvey has lost some of her intense focus, leading her to branch out to a tandem-billed collaboration in 1996 with John Parish, Dance Hall at Louse Point, and continuing up through her harrowing hey-why-not-piano? album White Chalk. Given all the ups and downs, perhaps it makes sense that Harvey should return to favored catalyst Parish for another collaborative go-round. Granted, Parish has been collaborating with Harvey as a producer and musician for years, even before Dry, but his co-billed discs with her offer him much more input, particularly considering that he's working with one of the music world's more imposing auteurs. As with their previous shared project, Parish wrote all of the music and played most of the instruments on A Woman a Man Walked By, leaving Harvey to the lyrics and singing. Harvey has said that her collaborations with Parish give her the freedom to push into new places, and there is a sense of exploration here as she fits her words to the shapes of his songs. You can detect Harvey taking the chance to stretch, if not necessarily as a lyricist, then certainly as a singer. On the conventional opener ""Black Hearted Love"", she sounds like she's singing from a different sonic plane than Parish's backing track, but she takes advantage of that distance by working the reverb-draped space for maximum drama. ""Sixteen, Fifteen, Fourteen"" is weirder, a locked-in-the-basement freak cousin to Zeppelin's folkier offerings, with Harvey's wails, pants, and whispers instilling the track with the right degree of crazy. On ""Leaving California"", she pushes her soprano to awkward heights, coming close to the unsettling falsetto drummer Rob Ellis used to provide. Elsewhere, in ""April"", Harvey twists her voice into a contorted croak, and punctuating the title track's breathless narrative is Harvey's snarled threat ""Stick it up your fucking ass."" It's the must unhinged we've heard her since she demanded ""Who the fuck?"" on Uh Huh Her, even if here she sounds like she's having some twisted fun (Albini would be proud). Later Harvey relishes the chance to howl some more on ""Pig Will Not""; if these aren't particularly pleasant listening experiences, they do make the lovely closer ""Cracks in the Canvas"" that much prettier in comparison. With all these divergent sides of Harvey on display, the disc in a sense amounts to an audition reel full of character studies, each delivered with method brio. Yet Harvey's always played the line between the personal and the persona close to her vest, much to the frustration of armchair psychologists everywhere. So how much of a stretch A Woman actually is, only she knows for sure (""The Soldier"", for example, would have been a boon to White Chalk). What's more, by this point in her career Harvey, has wandered so far from her roots that if she released a solo billed disc that sounded just like this, no one would likely even bat an eye. Whether it'd be considered a particularly good album is another matter. The disc succeeds as a public testing ground, but as an album it's ultimately unfocused. One problem is that Parish simply isn't the songwriter that Harvey is. That's okay-- few are-- but the result is that the material itself isn't terribly compelling musically or melodically, and at times it sounds like it could have been rushed together in a couple of days, lark-like. Surely pals Parish and Harvey had a good time making it, but there's not a lot to enjoy beyond Harvey's ever-inimitable presence. For some, that may be enough.","Harvey's second co-billed album with John Parish shows many divergent sides of the singer, in a sense amounting to an audition reel full of character studies.

Walk on Thin Air,The Old Ceremony,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2dc13d1975652138971/1:1/w_160/b6cf262e.jpg,2009-03-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12771-walk-on-thin-air/,Alyosha,"While it's certainly not as egregious as a shitty nu-grunge band naming itself Godsmack or some emo-inclined Morrissey acolytes calling themselves Girl in a Coma, Chapel Hill's the Old Ceremony does lay plain one of its most prominent influences with their choice of name. New Skin for the Old Ceremony is among the most revered entries in the distinguished catalogue of Leonard Cohen, whose darkly elegant approach to pop serves as clear (though by no means lone) inspiration for this noir-ish act that takes its name from his 1974 album. Clearly this isn't a band that shies away from its essential nature or refuses to admit its antecedents. Singer and principal songwriter Django Haskins has even acknowledged in interviews the seeming inevitability of his choosing to play guitar after having been named for the legendary Django Reinhardt. That attitude of acceptance and comfortableness in one's skin permeates the Old Ceremony's newest album, Walk on Thin Air, a mature, assured effort that finds the group confronting some of life's most grim and intractable realities with honest humility and patient deliberation. Such attributes aren't typical ingredients for high-octane rock'n'roll, and sure enough the Old Ceremony's music matches the confident care of the band's internal dynamic. An act that can swell to a dozen players in concert and has built a sartorial reputation by wearing suits onstage, the dapper Carolinians take a standard rock ensemble and dress it up with moody, stately things like violins and vibraphones. It's a tactic that adds dignity to the title track and the quietly devastating ""Murmur"", yet it can just as easily make the album feel like an overly buttoned-down affair, as when the group lets strings awkwardly riff on ""Same Difference"" or evokes the more grievous banalities of various 70s piano men on ""Stubborn Man"". For the most part, however, the orchestral elements in songs like ""Plate Tectonics"", ""The Disappear"", and ""Ready to Go"" simply serve as subtle yet distinguished reminders that these are grown-ass men playing these songs, working through life's problems with highball glasses in hand. The Old Ceremony's music can feel unsettled and even slightly disorienting (check the organs on ""By Any Other Name""), but it's only because the band is pushing up so closely against some pretty frightening truths. Somewhat paradoxically, it takes real self-possession to even meet these uncertainties head-on, accounting for the steady grace of songs like ""Plate Tectonics"", which correlates the inevitable disasters of love with the shifting of the earth, and ""By Any Other Name"", which ponders the futility and uncontrollableness of language. Haskins does play up brooding noir a bit too broadly on ""Ready to Go"" and ""Don't Parade Your Scars"" and particularly goes overboard on ""The Disappear"", a plodding, punch-drunk song about escaping the workaday world that makes me start to worry I was wrong about the National all along (though I still think the Brooklynites are more clever than this). Then again, such overly stylized transgressions are rendered easily forgivable by the humbly affecting bewilderment of ""Someone I Used to Know"", which marvels at the inevitable but no less baffling changes that time effects on past lovers whom we once thought we understood completely. The fact that change is one of the most fundamental of all constants is just another of the ironies that the members of the Old Ceremony wisely perceive, and even more wisely refuse to pretend they've mastered.","Yes, Leonard Cohen is an inspiration for this noir-ish act that takes its name from his 1974 album.

Rearrange Beds,An Horse,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f313d197565213899f/1:1/w_160/b404ed63.jpg,2009-03-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12789-rearrange-beds/,Mom + Pop,"Think back to your first loves-- the first records you loved, that is (this is Pitchfork after all). Maybe you were fortunate enough to have a savvy older sibling turn you on to things. Or maybe you were just born with preternatural good taste, and as such all your old faves remain unimpeachable. But chances are you're more like the rest of us: The older you get, and the more you expand your so-called musical horizons, the more some of those records that initially rocked your socks off start to reveal themselves as a little less than essential. Perhaps even-- like the phrase ""rock your socks off""-- a little embarrassing. This is why the Mars Volta move so much product, but it also helps illustrate why, for the right listener at the right time, Australian duo An Horse's debut album Rearrange Beds could be a revelation. Seasoned listeners will have encountered plenty of this brand of tight, dynamic indie rock before. And indeed the setup here is bracingly simple-- guitar/vocal and drums/tambourine/backing vocals-- and doesn't vary by much more than a melodica cameo and an effects pedal or two over the course of the record's 10 tracks. It's not so much what Kate Cooper (the guitarist/vocalist) and Damon Cox (the drummer/backing vocalist) do with these elements, however, as how they do it that sets Rearrange Beds apart. Cooper and Cox's project was born out of some impromptu jam sessions at a record shop they both worked at, and the record is rife with the sort of urgent energies one might expect from a moment of creative genesis. Whether it's the sexual frustration conveyed in ""Camp Out"" (""You wanna camp out,"" Cooper sings, ""and I want to screw around in the dark."") or the precarious perch alluded to in ""Shoes Watch"" (those shoes, it turns out, are watching from a rooftop), there's always a sense of something at stake. Which, hey, kinda sounds like emo. And indeed, in another band's hands, this could very well be an emo record. The lyrics read like excerpts from diary entries, and most find Cooper addressing an unnamed ""you"" with a tone of concern bordering on desperation. There are also plenty of collegiate-level cleverisms. Some work: the eighth track, which finds Cooper and Cox repeating ""I'm not really scared,"" is titled ""Scared as Fuck"". And then a central line in the title track-- ""Rearrange beds to make sure thoughts/ Flow straight from my house to yours""-- conjures the same sort of youthful escapism as the Arcade Fire's ""Neighborhood #1"" bit about digging a tunnel between two dwellings, shot through with a touch of the desperation that keeps An Horse's music riveting. Other attempts at cleverness leave a bad taste in the mouth, such as Cooper's closing track claim ""I've had a little too much to think"" or a line about ""bones that ache with things that you can't spell"" (also from the title track), which both sound a little too much like they could be Minus the Bear song titles. More often, though, lyrics fall somewhere in the middle, neither particularly offensive to one's sensibilities nor particularly inspiring. But again, it's how An Horse use their chosen tools that makes the difference. A chorus like ""It's okay to fall down/ It's okay to crumble"" won't elicit any epiphanies on paper, but the conviction with which Cooper sings it just might. And when she follows that by declaring ""I've seen this before,"" you believe her. Indeed, most of the tracks on Rearrange Beds build to anthemic choruses that practically beg for sing-alongs-- and the scores of disaffected teens and twentysomethings required to sing them. And when you can turn your own moment of catharsis into somebody else's, hey, you must be doing something right.","Australian duo and Tegan and Sara associates break out with a record that turns the introspective into the anthemic.

Matter and Light,The Theater Fire,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b3c0084474cd0c00da/1:1/w_160/d2468fd1.jpg,2009-03-27 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12738-matter-and-light/,self-released,"The Theater Fire can't win. Forming in 1995 as Vena Cava, the band eventually changed its name upon discovering another group using that same aortic moniker. Their new identity as the Theater Fire worked pretty well until a certain Canadian group came along. This time, though, they stuck to their guns, secure in the knowledge that despite the shared Fire, there's not much musical overlap between them and the Neon Bible thumpers. Instead of anthemic, extroverted indie, the Theater Fire make more subdued orchestral folk-rock that has more in common with Calexico and Will Oldham than with U2 or Springsteen. Maybe it's just because they're Texans, but something about the band's third album, Matter and Light, seems to view introversion as a form of secession. Perhaps because they've been forced to circle the wagons and rechristen themselves, they've cultivated a strong separatist streak in their music: With their clever orchestrations and cleverer lyrics (best: ""I'm not bitter but I hope she dies""), they inhabit their little corner of the Lone Star state, and while you're invited to listen in, they're not asking twice or saving you a seat. As a result, you get some indulgent songs that seem to satisfy only the band members themselves. They include three versions of ""Beatrice"" when one was certainly adequate: In particular, ""Beatrice (Ode)"", with its laughing strings and deep vocals, is a grating, Weillian number that seems much longer than its two-and-a-half minutes. On the other hand, you also get ""The Testicle Song"", which ought to be insufferable given that it sounds like Oldham doing voice work for ""Robot Chicken"". Delivered in a detached vocal over a drowsy arrangement, the lyrics spin a dick joke into what could be a mission statement: ""One is for shame, one is for glory, give 'em a name, make up a story."" More to the point, like Oldham with his interiorized folk and Seth Green with his deep pop culture arcana, the Theater Fire figure you either get it or you don't and quickly move on. Matter and Light, however, is far from inaccessible. The Fire have a knack for curious, slightly off arrangements that reveal their layers through repeated listens. Horns take their separate corners and come out fighting on ""Dahl Parts"", and ""Coyote"" grafts mournful horns to a candied riff that lands just this side of annoying. Their cover of Elliott Smith's ""Say Yes"" says yes to music box bells, plunking banjo, mariachi horns, and singing saw, but says no to lyrics. All they care about is Smith's mournful up-and-down melody, which makes a lovely album intermission. ""Uncle Wayne"" marries a skipping rhythm to Don Feagin's Smoggy vocals, lyrics about particularly gruesome car-crash fatalities, and trumpets playing one of the wryest fanfares ever. (It should be noted that the video features actress Angela Bettis of May fame, which means it is one of the best videos ever made). That fanfare only echoes Feagin's performance, which gravitates toward unannounced punchlines and constant self-deprecation. ""I'd like to help stop the war, but I just stayed home and watched it on TV,"" he sings on ""Swashbuckler Blues"". ""I'd like to rob from the rich and give to the poor, but I'm too lazy."" They may be territorial, but the Theater Fire are more engaged with the world than even they realize.","This subdued orchestral folk-rock band must have been pretty pissed off when Arcade Fire came around.

The Future Will Come,The Juan MacLean,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a343c0084474cd0c0224/1:1/w_160/7352e55d.jpg,2009-03-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12853-the-future-will-come/,DFA,"If you wanted to hear an askew semi-counterpoint to Hercules and Love Affair's longing, unrequited ""Blind"" last year, all you had to do was jump back a couple of weeks and one DFA catalogue number. The Juan MacLean's ""Happy House"" might have been comparatively overlooked in the wake of their labelmates' widespread critical success, but it's hard not to hear it as the weight on the other side of the scale. It jumps a decade or so past H&LA's Larry Levan-minded disco into a style alluded to in the song's double-meaning title, Nancy Whang's voice dripping with a cool, almost aloof exuberance that seemed content to ride along with that pulse-raising piano. It figures that its biggest refrain and most memorable line hints at an arch sort of romanticism: ""you are so... excellent."" Yet ""Happy House"" is a stylistic fluke in a discography that got rolling with the jagged yet warm electro-house of the 2002 single ""By the Time I Get to Venus"" and aimed upwards with 2005's Less Than Human. With more than a year to build on the goodwill accumulated by a potential career-changer, the Juan MacLean have already gone in a completely different direction on their new album. The Future Will Come does at least aim to join ""Happy House"" in its lean towards pop-music structure, even if it gets there through an era-spanning synth-pop pastiche rather than the euphoria of late-80s (and early 00s revival) house. That shouldn't be too out-of-nowhere, especially if you've already been primed by ""The Simple Life"", which followed ""Happy House"" in single form late last summer and points towards the Human League-gone-disco sound John MacLean hinted at during interviews in the run-up to this album. But that song, a gradually-building, subtly-mutating piece of Moroder-meets-Yaz(oo) that spans over eight and a half minutes in opening the album, is a red herring in its own way. That's because with the exception of the 10-minute ""Tonight"", which blends dubby T.K. Disco rhythm with Derrick May bass in the service of a song filled with strangely mournful-sounding anticipation, every track on The Future Will Come that hasn't already appeared as a single last year is a relatively short and succinct piece of work; think a bunch of radio edits instead of the 12"" mixes. The good news is that brevity keeps some of these tracks from getting stretched thin: The rubbery bongo-driven percussion and mutating, unraveling synths in the title track sound like they reach peak powers just before the song ends a few seconds shy of the five-minute mark, the midtempo electro-funk of ""Accusations"" fits in enough ebb-and-flow atmosphere to explore its Balearic-tweaking turf thoroughly, and cuts like ""A New Bot"" and ""The Station"" bypass gradual-build club dynamics entirely to focus on straightforward post-new-wave hookiness, whether it's frenetically anxious or brooding respectively. Yet a couple of other songs feel rudely truncated before they can build to the bigger, arm-waving moments that seem just over the horizon. The seething acid-house of ""No Time"", which sounds like the Human League's ""Being Boiled"" on heavy stimulants, ends too quickly, but it stings particularly hard when the 81-meets-89 rave-pop of ""One Day"" simply drops off a cliff after just more than four minutes when it sounds like it should go on for another six. Like most quality DFA full-lengths, this album has post-disco dance-pop aesthetics intersecting and merging in ways that transcend cheap retro; too much of it leaves you wondering if it could've gone even further with a bit more breathing room. Still, what could another four minutes here and there really do about the dour mood? That's the other gag The Future Will Come springs on the unsuspecting listener hoping for an hour's worth of ""Happy House"" giddiness, with Whang and MacLean sniping at each other in character like the Oakey/Sulley dynamic in ""Don't You Want Me"" pushed to a barely repressed loathing. It makes sense, since their vocals are incompatible with each other in the most basic respect. Whang is all coquettish detachment and reserved emotion, singing as though she just happens to be pretty good at expressing these feelings (but, y'know, not showing off or anything), while MacLean stretches his flat voice into attempted overenunciations and hiccupy quirkiness that are beyond the ability of his ideally-monotone voice. As they sing with clashing voices about how hard it is to get along with anyone, this is ebullient, frequently exciting music that trades on the concept of love as irritating farce. The first verse on ""The Simple Life"" opens with the Whang-sung couplet ""Promises you gave but never kept/ Apologies to save for last regrets""; ""One Day"" sees both singers trading embittered breakup barbs with the promise that ""I'll tell you what you wanna hear if you try"" the closest it gets to reconciliation; ""No Time"" drains all the empathy out of post-one-night stand ennui and brings out the casual cruelty in the typically-innocuous pop-lyric standby ""shut your mouth."" It's all a bit exhausting, but it does lead to a knockout bit of sequencing: from the sourly regretful back-and-forth relationship burden complaints of ""The Station"" to the sparse, false-ending-filled, self-pitying solo-piano dirge of ""Human Disaster""-- and then, to finish the album, ""Happy House"" in its complete 12-and-a-half minutes of ecstasy. That single hardly represents how the rest of the album turned out sounding, but you couldn't pick a better flash of light at the end of the tunnel.","Like most good DFA full-lengths, this album has post-disco dance-pop aesthetics intersecting and merging in ways that transcend cheap retro.

Beware,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34a13d1975652138a61/1:1/w_160/dec78a1e.jpg,2009-03-27 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12859-beware/,Drag City,"In his review of last year's exceptional Lie Down in the Light, Stephen Deusner noted just how consistent Will Oldham's output had become, bemoaning somewhat Oldham's inability to truly excite. But there's a yin to that yang, that being Oldham has amassed such an army of friends and co-conspirators that he can create an album of Lie Down's quality without excessive pressure or to-do. For the second year in a row, Oldham drops a fully-formed, gorgeously wrapped disc with little buildup, though Beware will receive a promotional bump (a small tour and, in some markets, local-cable commercials) that Oldham begged off of Lie Down. Beware moves Oldham closer still to proper country music, uprooting some of Lie Down's balmy Appalachian posts for robust, quivering compositions recorded with an almost entirely new group of musicians. So Beware is Oldham's ""big"" record (touring, promotion, etc.), but musically the album seems in many ways smaller-- or at least more level-- than Lie Down. Beware contains no sentiment as scintillating as ""So Everyone""'s ode to public intimacy, no melody quite as curvaceous as ""For Every Field There's a Mole"", and its considerably more ominous artwork and lyrical content feel more in line with Oldham's norms. From its imperative title to ""Afraid Ain't Me""'s final instructions to ""Work, baby,"" Oldham seems more inclined than ever to instruct and guide, a move befitting his age, experience, and the role he plays in the indie-rock community. It's a role that, predictably, Oldham turns upside down within moments of the album's first lines, circling the title's sure-handed warning around himself: ""Beware of me."" Oldham acolytes already know this, as Oldham often fibs-- or ""sings in character,"" to be judicious-- but Beware still stands as Oldham's sagest album yet, with many of its poignant moments arriving as knowing declarations. It's strange to suggest that Oldham is suddenly somehow wiser, but Beware doesn't lack for perspective. He talks lovingly of children, pokes fun at his physique, and receives an ""unfinal call""-- a warning-- from an angel. When on the lover's hymn ""My Life's Work"" Oldham says, ""I take this load on/ It is my life's work,"" he could just as easily be talking about the burdens of cult artistry. Elsewhere, the familial comforts of Lie Down have been replaced with ribald, cowboy promiscuity. Oldham's characters' relationships with women have developed into a loving, frustrating dependence: ""It's kind of easy to have some fun/ When you don't belong to anyone."" He occasionally aims for the type of woebegone romanticism Jack White's been hamming at for years, singing during the goofy horn-led rocker ""You Don't Love Me"", ""You say my kissing rates a six on a scale of one to 10/ And you wouldn't pass the time with me 'cept you're tired of all your friends."" When he commits, divulging that he wants to be your ""only friend,"" he's immediately on the defensive: ""Is that scary?"" Beware's backing cast might lean a bit hard on conventional arrangements, but even when Oldham's not turning American musics on their heads, he paws at them playfully. Songs spire heartily upwards (""You Are Lost"") or move in fits (""Heart's Arms""); buzzing slide guitars and plucked banjos don't sound laconic, they sound nervy. Sometimes the convention-chucking is more explicit, like the flutes and flanged guitars of the ropey ""I Am Goodbye"" or the twiddling marimba on ""You Can't Hurt Me Now"". The resultant songs have a familiarity that aims them toward the back of your brain but an internal energy that prods them into prominence with repeated listens. Oldham has once again surrounded himself with voices, lending credence to the characters and modes he slips in and out of. Unlike Lie Down's Ashley Webber or The Letting Go's Dawn McCarthy, Jennifer Hutt and Emmett Kelly (among others) serve less as foils than as gatherers, doubling and tripling Oldham's creak like some gospel-not-gospel choir. It is warm and well-felt music, to the point where the message of a song like ""I Don't Belong to Anyone"" might differ substantially had a younger Oldham performed it sans accompaniment (""Don't Belong"" is followed, incidentally, by ""There Is Something I Have to Say"", the lone, croaky Beware track that might've fit on Master and Everyone). The sheer number of roles that Oldham inhabits, however, should prevent anyone from drawing hard conclusions about his state of mind. Beware feels more severe and less physical than Lie Down, but Oldham still talks about his tummy on two separate occasions. It feels wise, but there's Oldham, hooting and whooping during ""I Am Goodbye"". It feels content in its place, but there's the commercial during ""Ellen"" in the New Orleans market. When Oldham sings, ""I know everyone knows the trouble I have seen/ That's the thing about trouble you can love,"" he might well be jiggling his belly at artist-audience relationships. Impossible to say whether Oldham's being candid or goofing on despair, but either way, he's earned the right.","For the second year in a row, Will Oldham drops a fully-formed, gorgeously wrapped disc with little buildup.

Winter Hours,Tombs,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32b9d034d5c69bf2d62/1:1/w_160/0d0bb6ba.jpg,2009-03-26 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12834-winter-hours/,Relapse,"Well, here's a sensation I don't get to experience much: Hearing a new metal album and wishing the songs were longer. Winter Hours, the second album from Brooklyn doom power-trio Tombs, arguably peaks with ""Merrimack"", an epically lacerating blast of animosity that abruptly ends before it hits the four-minute mark. It opens with a really pretty, scratchy, warm guitar haze, but it doesn't stay there long. Pretty soon, everything flares up into a thundering groove, which pounds and pounds and pounds and then just stops. ""Merrimack"" could be three times as long as it is and nobody would blink. And even though it's become a massive cliché in underground metal to run a track like this into the ground, I can't help but wish Tombs would've spent a little more time digging in and zoning out on something like this. But no: four minutes, and then it's off to the next all-climax roar. Right now, a pretty huge chunk of the American metal underground labors under the twin shadows of Neurosis and Isis, two bands that slowly build these monoliths of ire, songs that start out soft and pile on effects until they become blurry, gale-force maelstroms of fuzzed-out guitar and floor-tom thud. There's even a name for it: the Neur-Isis sound, logically enough. Even when this stuff is great (like when Neurosis does it), it can't help but smack of formula. Tombs take that formula and do something interesting with it: They start with the blistering climax, and they stay there. No windswept atmospheric intros, no drawn out outros. It's full-blast all the time. Only a couple of songs on Winter Hours soldier on past the five-minute mark, and most burn out way before. And only a couple of quick sculpted-feedback interludes give us a chance to catch our breaths. In a way, that's sort of a brilliant approach. And it sure helps that Tombs are at home within their own sound. The grooves feel totally intuitive, even when they lurch into pseudo-black metal so-fast-they're-slow blurs. Frontman and Boston hardcore veteran Mike Hill has a great vein-bulging bellow that only really loses its impact when he stops shouting and tries to sing, which he rarely does. And he spends as much time doing these sort of vaseline-smeared Dick Dale hummingbird/bumblebee chattering guitar noises as he does playing actual riffs, knowing exactly when to snap from one to the other. But the locked-in thunder of Winter Hours can get a bit exhausting. Staying in constant bombast mode keeps Tombs from letting much dynamic range creep into their attack, and they barely offer anything in the way of melody or structure. If you're in the right mood for that sort of cathartic, omnidirectional animosity, it's great. They have that sound down absolutely cold, and they never sound anything less than demonic. But I can't help but think that these tracks would hit so much harder if they came attached to actual songs, if Tombs developed their sound beyond the narrow but suffocating crunch they offer here. Theirs is a sound you can get totally lost in, when they let you.","Well, here's a sensation we don't get to experience much: Hearing a new metal album and wishing the songs were longer.

Real Recognize Real,Project Pat,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3015e6ef95969320553/1:1/w_160/042ff72a.jpeg,2009-03-26 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12802-real-recognize-real/,Hypnotize Minds,"Ever since they won the Oscar, the Three 6 Mafia dudes have been on a fast train to cheeseball-ville. With the Crunchy Black defection, the unbearably degrading MTV reality show, and the Good Charlotte collabo, it's tough to reconcile today's attention-hungry goofballs with the unruly, demonic fight-music mob that emerged out of Memphis not all that long ago. But they'll always have one thing that ties them to their hard-as-bones past, and that one thing is Project Pat. Project Pat is Juicy J's brother, which ties him forever to half of the Three 6 nucleus. But Pat wouldn't know how to begin turning himself approachable. In 2001, he went to prison on gun possession charges only a few months after scoring his first and only solo hit. Since he got out in 2005, he's quietly churned out three solo albums, each harder and darker than the last. Real Recognize Real is his hardest and darkest album yet, and with apologies to 2002's Layin' da Smack Down, it's probably his best. Pat doesn't sound tough, exactly, and he doesn't need to. He sounds eerie, and that's what makes his gun-talk resonate. His voice is a sort of detuned singsong squeak. His delivery is playful, but not in a friendly way. He rolls his syllables around in his mouth before spitting them out. For a few bars at a time, he'll try on a mocking playground melody or a horror-movie stage-whisper. He pronounces stuff wrong on purpose. He says stuff that doesn't make any sense: ""I'm more North Memphis than some dog food up ya nose."" On 2007's ""Bull Frog Yay"", he interrupted a track about dealing coke to chirp ""Ribbit!"" a bunch of times on the hook. Those oddball hiccups he throws into his flow only serve to underline the absolute control he flexes over his vocal meter, and on something like his masterful guest verse on 8Ball & MJG's ""Relax & Take Notes"", he manages to best two amazing bulldozer rappers by staying just somehow off, keeping his voice flickering in the shadows. After a quick skit, Real Recognize Real opens with a thick, luxuriant sample of the O'Jays' ""Listen to the Clock on the Wall"", slowed down and distended on some classic Memphis soul-rap shit. Pat sounds great over those languorous horn bleats and looped-up coos, but it's a red herring. The album really starts a track later, on ""Slick Hater"", when DJ Paul and Juicy J (who produced this entire album just like they produce every Project Pat album) bury a peal of malevolent laughter under inspirational 1980s sports-movie synths, turning in one of the air-sucked-out gothic stomps they can still somehow create at will. All the track's little synth-bits interlock together into an overwhelming steamroller of a track, and Pat just tears it to pieces. His threats are so vivid and disturbing and oddly specific that they sort of become funny, the way it's funny when Jason squeezes somebody's head so his eyeball pops out at the camera: ""Snatch the panties off these lames like I would do a ho/ .44 revolver, barrel up the booty hole."" From there, Pat's off. On ""Bang Smack"", he and fellow sui generis freaky libertine Gucci Mane trade faded verses over evocative keyboard wobbles, Pat comparing sex-noises to (seriously) a plunger. On ""Ain't Scared of Ya"", Pat makes boing-boing sound effects immediately after threatening to kick your mother in the face. On ""Choppa to Ya Dome"": ""I'm a gorilla, so I always shoot banana clips/ Torpedoes coming out my gun, tearing ya ligaments."" At some point during the recording process, Pat must've watched The Wizard of Oz; he talks about foes ""dying like the Wicked Witch"" on ""Catch a Hot One"" (they're melting?), and then, two tracks later, he's getting brain like he went to see the Wizard. That weird combination of violence and hilarity is serious full-immersion stuff, and the way he bounces his voice around Paul and Juicy's hall-of-mirrors production, that immersion becomes just about irresistible. Nobody does aggro simmer like this guy, and when I'm in the right mood, I can't imagine listening to anyone else.","Since he got out of prison in 2005, this Memphis MC has quietly churned out three solo albums, each harder and darker than the last.

Rockwell,Anni Rossi,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2bdc0084474cd0c00f1/1:1/w_160/498167b4.jpeg,2009-03-26 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12747-rockwell/,4AD,"Anni Rossi is a multi-instrumentalist who began violin training at age three, and has been performing as a solo artist since high school. After relocating to Chicago from Los Angeles, where she studied composition at California Institute of the Arts, the 23-year-old Minnesota native has rounded up a small but dedicated fanbase during extensive tours throughout Europe and the United States. When I first saw Rossi perform live, in Berlin during summer 2006, she was a member of Carla Bozulich's touring band. Performing her solo set before the headline act, Rossi stole the show with her charmingly nonchalant stage presence and distinctive voice, which was accompanied solely by her viola and a few heated, percussive foot stomps. Like her vocals, which often sound as though they may fall out of tune at any moment yet never do, Rossi's unconventional viola playing is a huge part of her appeal. Rather than bowing the strings, she often prefers to strum and pluck, using the instrument to emphasize and soundtrack her lyrics. On a popular live song, for example, she emulates the sound of her ""father shoveling snow"" and ""cars on icy packed roads"" with a fricative scrape of the strings that brings her tale of childhood winters in the Midwest to life. Anni Rossi's 4AD debut full-length, Rockwell, named after her street in Chicago and keeping to a tradition of titling recordings after places she has lived, is the conclusion of a series of recording experiments taken over the last few years (full disclosure: I was in a band that released music on Too Pure, a label that also released music by Rossi). Her instrumentation is so sparse that it naturally calls for the highest standards of recording to fully translate the relationship between the vocals and strings, so it's not surprising that she chose to record Rockwell with Steve Albini, albeit in a day. The result is far closer in sound to her splendid, confident live shows and less cluttered than her 2007 effort Scandia, which featured an abundance of orchestral touches. New York City based composer Devin Maxwell, who provides effective and unobtrusive drumming to all but one of the songs, and cellist Caroline Burdette are the only other musicians featured on the album and round the songs out nicely without convoluting their essential clarity. While the majority of Rockwell includes songs that Rossi has had in her repertoire for the last few years, there are a couple of new gems. ""Las Vegas"", about the pre-fight hopes of an ultimately defeated boxer, is lyrically one of her most powerful songs and shows how stunning music can be when kept stark and simple. Then there's her unlikely take on Ace of Base's ""Living in Danger"", which is a lighthearted match for her live cover of the Cure's ""Inbetween Days"" and serves to highlight her considerable appetite for pop music, which is just as present on Rockwell as her capacity for writing songs with classical sensibility. Perhaps most enjoyable of all is that there's something remarkably personable about this album, as though Anni Rossi is right there in the room with you, singing her heart out about beekeeping in the Himalayas, her love for freezer units, and the troubles of driving to the west coast with no air conditioning.","Recorded with Steve Albini, the debut full-length from this classically trained artist is far closer to her confident live shows than previous recordings.

Histoire de Melody Nelson,Serge Gainsbourg,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb90abf31b7dc7155b02/1:1/w_160/62bb2d6e.jpg,2009-03-26 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"Serge Gainsbourg had no great attachment to genre. By the time he came to rock music, in his early 40s, the French star had traced his oblique, provocative course through chanson (French vocal music), jazz, and light pop. He'd made percussive café jams about suicide and given Eurovision popstrels France Gall and Françoise Hardy songs full of blowjob puns. Later on he'd make a rock'n'roll album about the Nazis and a reggae take on the French national anthem. A pattern emerges: Gainsbourg hops from style to style, but with a terrific instinct for finding the most startling content for any given form. So it's no surprise his rock work-- the early 1970s albums, of which Histoire de Melody Nelson is the first and finest-- was so original. Melody Nelson is a collaboration with composer and arranger Jean-Claude Vannier, who assembled a bunch of top sessionmen for the album. But Gainsbourg and Vannier had little interest in the conventions that had accreted around early 70s rock. Like a lot of 1971 records, Histoire de Melody Nelson is a concept album: Unlike most, it's only 28 minutes long. The songs are lavishly orchestrated, yet the dominant instrument isn't guitar or organ but rather Herbie Flowers' lascivious, treacly bass, playing a seedy, rambling take on funk. That bass is the first sound you hear on Melody Nelson, quietly tracking up and down in a windscreen-wiper rhythm: Gainsbourg starts talking in French 30 seconds later, describing a night drive in a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost. The album is routinely described as ""cinematic,"" but the music is more of a mindtrack than a soundtrack-- a tar pit of introspection when Gainsbourg's brooding narrator is alone at the record's beginning and end, then giddy and savage by turns as he conducts his affair with the 15-year-old Melody across the short tracks in the album's middle. One of these-- ""Ballade de Melody Nelson""-- is, even at two minutes, one of Gainsbourg's most assured and alluring pop songs. A lot of Gainsbourg's records are hard sells for Anglophone ears-- the music is there to illuminate and pace the man's riotous, sensual wordplay. But Gainsbourg's alliance with Vannier produced a true collaboration: The arrangements seem to respond almost intuitively to the twists in Gainsbourg's language and narrative, to the point where they're carrying as much storytelling weight as the words. Even if your French stops at ""bonjour"", the music lets you know that this is a record about a dark, obsessional love. On ""L'hôtel Particulier"", for instance-- describing the sleazy grandeur of the rented rooms where the narrator and Melody make love-- Gainsbourg's voice shudders with lust and dread, and the music responds, flares of piano and string breaking into the song over an impatient bassline. The actual story of Histoire de Melody Nelson is pretty negligible in any case-- man meets girl, man seduces girl, girl dies in freak plane crash. Melody herself (played by Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg's then-lover) is a cipher-- a breathed name, a ticklish squeal or two, and red hair. The album is all about its narrator: A natural obsessive just looking for an object; introspective before he meets Melody, more so after her death. First and final tracks ""Melody"" and ""Cargo Culte"" are musical siblings, with only the wordless chorales on ""Cargo Culte"" really distinguishing them. Together these songs take up more than half the record, and when people claim Melody Nelson as an influence, it's almost certainly with this pair in mind. The soundworld they create is like nothing else in rock-- orchestra, bass, and voice circling one another, blending slow funk, intimate mumbling, and widescreen scope. One precedent is the epic soul Isaac Hayes had been pioneering, but where Hot Buttered Soul is full of warmth and engagement, the bookend tracks of Melody Nelson are a trip through far more hostile territories, the black spaces of a man's interior. Gainsbourg realized he'd made something special-- he named his publishing company Melody Nelson after his fictional muse-- but, restless as ever, he didn't follow it up: His next album was a sequence of pretty acoustic songs, mostly about shit. Herbie Flowers, whose bass is the undertow pulling the album together, surfaced a year later playing on Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"", whose bassline is the first ripple of Melody Nelson's wider pop culture influence. Since then it's been left to others-- Jarvis Cocker, Beck, Tricky, Air, Broadcast-- to pick up this record's breadcrumb trail. But Gainsbourg's dark focus, and Vannier's responsiveness, aren't easily equalled. This reissue on luxuriously hefty vinyl is the first time the album's been released in the U.S.-- a superb opportunity to hear a record that's been occasionally imitated but never matched.","Almost unbelievably, the French master's best work was out of print in North America. Light in the Attic rectifies that error.

The music was also confrontational, with lead singer Karen O following in the footsteps of countless riot grrls and righteous rock queens in crafting a persona of raw defiance and sexual menace. Fast-forward six years, and a glance at the instantly iconic cover of the band's third full-length, It's Blitz!, tells you all you need to know about how far the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have come, from Fever to Tell through the middle-ground growing pains of 2006's Show Your Bones and up to today. A clean, simple image of a woman's hand bursting an egg-- it's no less powerful an indication of feminine strength and defiance than Fever's abrasive scrawl, yet it's miles and miles more subversive. It's also a fitting symbol for its music, taking familiar shapes and tools and recombining them in ways that are bracing and unexpected. It's Blitz! is constructed from parts that by themselves aren't extraordinary-- in fact, many of them are quite banal, like the generic Franz-Bloc-Killers modern rock riff that propels ""Dull Life"" or the doomy one that drives ""Shame and Fortune"", sounding ripped straight off a late-period Smashing Pumpkins record. Much has been made of the album's heavy reliance on rock's eternal bugaboo, the synth, but often the synths are doing rock things rather than dance things, like on the buzzing, road-burning opener ""Zero"". Only two songs, ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"", deliver real disco backbeats. With these unremarkable tools, however, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs still create great, compelling pop-rock, largely because of the way the songs themselves are organized, with conventional verse-chorus structures repeatedly eschewed in favor of detours, miniature grooves, and lengthy asides that produce the sensation of a band and a singer impulsively following their own emotional whims. Take the lovely, insinuating ""Soft Shock"", for instance-- it starts with tinkly keyboards and an Far East-sounding melody that builds to a refrain utilizing the words in the song's title, but it isn't the song's emotional climax, which is hidden until later, when Karen worriedly intones ""what's the time, what's the day, gonna leave me?"" Even more compositionally jarring are the slow, stretched-out set showcases ""Skeletons"" and ""Runaway"", the former taking a blippy little electro-ballad and then plopping martial drums and a melody that sounds taken from some Scottish battle hymn smack dab in the middle. In keeping with the arty tendencies that have blossomed within the band from the beginning, these songs often feel portioned out into passages or movements as opposed to flowing organically throughout. With such an absence of easy signposts, we're especially apt to follow Karen wherever she goes, since she's our only hope for a guide. Yet she refuses to be a locus of explanation or control, keeping her lyrics generally vague and frequently losing herself in bursts of incomprehensible excitement or fervor. These fits and embellishments account for most of the best moments on the album-- the way she breathlessly pants ""crying, crying, crying"" on ""Zero"", or giddily draws out the last syllable of the line ""a hundred years old"" on ""Dull Life"", or how ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"" periodically dissipate into an inchoate softness. The ninth song on Fever to Tell was ""Maps"", a fleeting glimpse of vulnerability on an album of gleeful scorn. On It's Blitz! that slot is occupied by ""Hysteric"", a song every bit as emotionally naked and immediately indelible as ""Maps"". Here though, it represents an island of piercing clarity and happy convention in a sea of bewilderment, impulse, and ecstasy.","YYYs make the dreaded ""mature album"" work by taking familiar shapes and tools and recombining them in ways that are bracing and unexpected.

Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band,Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3129d034d5c69bf2d30/1:1/w_160/30dd697a.jpg,2009-03-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12815-mt-st-helens-vietnam-band/,Dead Oceans,"How many generic indie rock tropes can a band stuff into a mere three minutes? Probably more than the Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band manages in ""Who's Asking"", the first track from their self-titled debut, but that's not to denigrate the group's dubious achievement. In those three short minutes, we get dramatically massed vocals, upshifted double-time guitars, half-time breakdowns, perky synth flourishes propelling a poppy bridge, and a disjointed, herky-jerk denouement. The following track, ""Masquerade"", is no less frustrating in its cut-and-paste approach, featuring irony-free metal leads and distracting waltz-time detours, both of which derail what might have been, left alone, a perfectly servicible rave-up. By ""Cheer for Fate"", the third track, the disc has ominously displayed a notable lack of traction, the songs slipping away out of control like a speeding car hydroplaning across the surface of a highway (and not in a good way). And so it goes. Arrangements that never quite gel, tempo and tonal shifts that sabotage whatever momentum the Seattle band has managed to muster, flat production (courtesy Scott Colburn, who has otherwise impressive credits with Arcade Fire and Animal Collective to his name) that muffles the group's energy-- Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band sound like a bunch of talented, precocious kids let loose for an afternoon in a studio and given until the end of the day to devise their grand statement. It tries too hard, yet somehow, at the same time, not hard enough. The fact that the band seems in such good spirits throughout does at least mitigate the record's half-baked feel. These glimmers of giddiness boost ""Going on a Hunt"" and ""Dull Reason"" out of the ghetto of the totally tedious, injecting some grinning character into songs otherwise grimly by-the-books. Indeed, no matter how many quirky, gimmicky twists and turns tunes like ""Little Red Shoes"" or ""En Fuego"" might take-- and the latter, for example, does swerve suddenly from those Iron Maiden-ready leads to moments of pensive introspection, however fleetingly-- they never take us anywhere truly surprising, let alone interesting. In fact, when the record does hit a quiet patch, as it does at the start of the string-laden final track ""On the Collar"", the strategy backfires, since you wait with baited breath for some sudden change that for once never comes. Albums that leave you wanting more are one thing. Albums that leave you hanging are something else. With more experience, the group could perhaps one day drum up a more cohesive, compelling vision, something that reaches out and grabs you. For now, though, the band's grasping at straws.","MSHVB sound like a bunch of talented, precocious kids let loose for an afternoon in a studio and given until the end of the day to devise a grand statement.

The Invisible Lodger,Various Production,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f65e6ef95969320538/1:1/w_160/2fb4ba89.jpg,2009-03-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12792-the-invisible-lodger/,Fire,"UK electronic duo Various Production released their debut album, 2006's The World is Gone, at the best possible moment. Dubstep-- the brooding, bass-heavy offshoot of UK garage-- had been enjoying a brief burst of popularity with the international record nerd community. Early Various singles like ""Hater"" swiped dubstep's instantly recognizable low-end wobble and syncopated snares, while adding a few moderately novel touches: Perhaps only in a genre glutted with minimalist electronic instrumentals could the simple addition of acoustic instruments and trip-hop vocals lead to instant online buzz. And that buzz only grew louder thanks to Various' packaging decisions. Various released its early singles on indie-friendly 7"" vinyl, dressing them up with decadent, hand-drawn covers that featured little in the way of identifying information about the men (or women) responsible for the music. This old-school media blackout was a red flag to novelty-starved critics used to access to everything from bathroom habits to the location of birthmarks. Various was all set to cement its rep as the sorta-dubstep act du jour when The World Is Gone dropped on the well-distributed XL label. The reviews for The World Is Gone were mostly excellent, and rightly so. But dubstep's moment of quasi-mainstream attention turned out to be less than a blip, at least in America. (Aside from Burial, maybe, but that's another review.) Now Various, their purposeful anonymity shtick leaving them vaguely aligned with any particular scene, was well suited to weather this sudden lack of attention, as dubstep's core producers retreated to the international (but UK-centered) underground. But instead of fleeing for the safety of chill out culture or morphing into a post-rock act or some other lame-ass audience-building measure, Various issued a remix comp and a handful of singles that pledged allegiance to the digital brutalism of dubstep's new school. And now comes album number two, The Invisible Lodger, closer to the funereal mood of The World is Gone than the 8-bit beatdowns of current dubstep hotshots like Rustie and Zomby. (A partial exception is ""Robot Dialogue"", where the corrosive bleeps come off like Various' take on recent ""wonky"" singles, but at a tempo that suggests its creators were very sad and/or very stoned.) So the rain-soaked vibe remains, but rhythmically the doggedly downcast Invisible Lodger owes very little to the sinister, club-ready throb of the duo's own early work. ""The Unwritten Book"", in fact, sounds uncannily like an old Mogwai demo. The ratio of gloom-rock to garage has been sharply inverted on The Invisible Lodger. Whereas Various tunes once stood out by mixing fragile fingerpicked guitar with brutish, sampler-built cyborg grooves, new tracks like ""The Pure Sun"" and ""English Estate"", with their Radiophonic Workshop synth sweeps and wheezing accordions, float along almost beat-free. But not vocal-free. On The World is Gone, the femme vocals added replay value to a genre that, stripped of the human voice, could get pretty repetitive. (Hey, even acknowledged techno geniuses would have a hard time coming up with an interesting 60 minutes using just beats and bass.) The ladies stayed home this time out, and Various drafted a lone male vocalist: Scottish poet Gerry Mitchell. Not a brilliant move, true, but not a crippling blow. At the risk of being castigated by poetry fans and Mitchell's mom, I have to admit I didn't spend a lot of time on lyrical analysis while listening to The Invisible Lodger. Those in the know may think Mitchell's work is spectacular or truly awful, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the album. It didn't particularly enhance it, either. The sound of his voice, however, adds an extra layer of campy desolation to Various' infinite sadness. Mitchell's batter-thick brogue becomes another instrument, one deployed with an occasionally irritating regularity. Now it's Various' music that demonstrates an admirable range, while the vocals get pretty repetitive. A lot of people are going to hate on this record, and needlessly so. I understand the involuntary internal shudder of revulsion caused by the phrase ""spoken word"" quite well. But The Invisible Lodger is hardly a drastic change to Various' basic sound. (It's not as if they ditched some idiosyncratic, irreplaceable frontman with some dude hawking chapbooks on a Glasgow streetcorner.) Yes, it's hardly as good as The World is Gone , but whether they collaborate with melancholy chick crooners hymning emotional masochism, or melancholy dude poets mumbling into their lager about the collapse of western civ, Various still knows their way around bummed out background music.","Yes! A new Various Production record! And... it's a collaboration with Scottish poet Gerry Mitchell. Hmm.

Caught in the Trees,Damien Jurado,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2deea9e61561daa4b53/1:1/w_160/4cff30de.jpeg,2009-03-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12773-caught-in-the-trees/,Secretly Canadian,"When Damien Jurado flashed his new wedding ring during a show in Chicago this past fall, a chorus of ""awwww""s seeped from the crowd predictably. One has to wonder, however, if there weren't a few seasoned fans in that audience whose ""awwww""s were underscored by ""uh-oh""s. The songwriter settling down here is, after all, one of the better chroniclers of heartbreak, betrayal, and the other side of love working at the moment. And while no decent person could wish misery on another just for the sake of song, we've nevertheless seen plenty of talents derailed by rehab, children, and holy matrimony. But let's not get carried away: What we do know is something-- maybe marriage, maybe a general restlessness, maybe straight-up serendipity-- woke Jurado up after 2006's stately and sometimes sleepy Now That I'm in Your Shadow. The result, 2008 opus Caught in the Trees, features a rock solid outing from backing bandmates Jenna Conrad and Eric Fisher supporting some of Jurado's best songwriting to date-- not to mention his most rousing musical offerings since I Break Chairs, all congealing in a manner one can't help but call effortless. Opener ""Gillian Was a Horse"" sets the bar high, thanks to crisp drumming and the clockwork crunch of a maraca. ""Trials"" and ""Caskets"" are similarly propulsive, carried along by confident strums and a viscous bassline, respectively. Elsewhere, ""Last Rights"" sails along a bed of strings. Gone are the pregnant silences that punctuated Shadow, and with them the hesitant tempos of hopelessness. Caught in the Trees, quite simply, is too busy moving along to get too caught up in anything. Which isn't to say Jurado's usual complexities aren't here; if he has ever written an unequivocally contented song, I've yet to hear it. Indeed, a good half of the numbers on Caught in the Trees deal directly with a favorite theme of Jurado's: the fallout from infidelity, manifest most often here in repeated references to lies, liars, lying, specters of jealous husbands, and ""bullshit talkers."" Yet there's a sense of progress too, of looming reconciliation or at the very least the intention to work things through rather than dwell on them. ""Dimes"" begins with Jurado resolving to call a lover's husband, and ends by asking ""What happens now, when it all goes down?"" Later, ""Sheets"" seems to take that husband's perspective, with the lover cast as ""a wounded bird needing a nest."" By ""Best Dress"", someone-- could be the lover, could be the husband-- sounds prepared the claim the embattled woman as his own once and for all. Still, the most satisfying moments on Trees are those that find Jurado and his band embracing their pop sensibilities: ""Gillian"" is a thing of wondrous songwriting efficacy, its verses all snapping snugly into place like so many Lego blocks. Album high point ""Go First"" triumphs as both the record's most dynamic and anthemic track, and like ""Gillian"", also makes the most concessions to standard verse-chorus structure. Trees' latter half culminates with ""Paper Kite"", which conveys a drama and a desolation that go beyond Jurado's words thanks to atmospheric production flourishes. These three tracks in particular feel the most removed from Shadow, and, we might speculate, the most indicative of what our groom may have in store post-honeymoon. If that is so, then by all means: till death do them part.","The veteran singer-songwriter treads familiar thematic territory with a tight backing band and a renewed sense of cheer.

Slow Dance,Jeremy Jay,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a329b1335d7bf1698671/1:1/w_160/87004e78.jpg,2009-03-25 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12832-slow-dance/,K,"Whenever some idiot convinced you that stuff like crushes and holding hands was dumb, that what you should really care about is getting action, that's when you became an adult and started dying. I think I'm paraphrasing fellow music critic Chuck Eddy here. Remember your first slow dances, seventh or eight grade? For me there was a lot of nervous excitement, plus whatever you call the emotion when you're a clumsy preteen dancing to ""The End of the Road"" with the girl you like, or ""I Swear"" with the girl who likes you. I seem to recall high school dances being similarly fraught. Now try to think of the last time you felt something that intensely. Jeremy Jay, then, must live in Neverland. But is he Peter Pan-- or Michael Jackson? The question gets more interesting on the hiccupy-voiced Paris/L.A. bandleader's second K Records LP. It's the most weirdly mesmerizing in a series of promising single, EP, and full-length releases that includes last year's shadowy, cinematic heart-tugger A Place Where We Could Go. Jay's the type of guy who tours with Deerhunter but covers Madonna just as naturally as Brian Eno. Billed as winter-themed, Slow Dance uses crisp garage-rock and frigid post-punk as a backdrop for romanticized pop fantasy. ""Slow dance"" has has basically emerged as its own, resurgent genre these past several years: the cosmic disco of Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas, and Todd Terje; the flamenco-inflamed beach trips of Studio, Boat Club, Hatchback, and Windsurf; the after-hours glide of Glass Candy and Chromatics; the sample-based vacations of Quiet Village and Air France. That connection is probably a coincidence. But then again, maybe it isn't. On the first few listens, I noticed the record's minimal yet evocative lyrical repetitions less than its snow-globe-meticulous sound. Jay recorded the album in winter at Olympia's Dub Narcotic Studio, with bassist Derek James, drummer Nick Pahl, and additional guitarist Ilya Malinsky; the early nights and electric lighting of the season are all over the frosty synth-and-guitar surface of opener ""We Were There"" (a new version of a 2007 single), the slow strums and cold breaths of gorgeously spare ""Winter Wonder"", and the choked sobs and fingersnaps of piano waltz ""Slow Dance 2"". ""You've got the rhythm,"" Jay insists on ""In This Lonely Town"". That song also captures a vivid scene, maybe the opening of a film: the narrator walking with his peacoat on, seeing fish by the pier, smelling coffee and sweets by the ""pizza club."" Part of the pleasure of repeat listens is trying to figure out whether Jay is just too innocent to be true-- like, what's he hiding, right? ""Giddyup, horsey, giddyup,"" goes ""Gallop""; ""Canter, canter, canter,"" adds the next song, ""Canter Canter"". And there Jay is, amid the ""disco lights"" (!) and Drifters-style percussion of ""Will You Dance With Me?"", resting his head on your shoulders, ""melting in your arms tonight."" Jay envisions an angelic guitar-strummer illuminated by a disco ball (!!) on ""Where Could We Go Tonight?"", again raising more questions than answers. In the final seconds of the most urgent-sounding track, ""Breaking the Ice"", he murmurs almost as an aside: ""Should've told you that I love you."" You could choose to dismiss it all as kids' stuff. But that's the idiot talking.","Billed as winter-themed, Slow Dance uses crisp garage-rock and frigid post-punk as a backdrop for romanticized pop fantasy.

Junior,Röyksopp,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34b5e6ef959693205fb/1:1/w_160/f9524760.jpg,2009-03-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12860-junior/,Astralwerks,"Listen to it now and you might beg to differ, but history's current take on The Understanding (Röyksopp's 2005 answer to their relentlessly smiley faced debut) seems to be that it was a misstep. Despite a lead single (""Only This Moment"") that foresaw trance's miniature mainstream resurgence and memorable contributions from Karin Driejer (whose ""What Else Is There"" ranks among Röyksopp's finest songs) and Chelonis R. Jones (whose syncopated ""49 Percent"" helped eke the Norwegian duo into more credible techno territory), this darker, more textured follow-up stalled at the gate. In retrospect, it was probably done under by both expectation and competition: Not only did The Understanding fail to deliver anything as relentlessly chirpy as early single ""Eple"" or as friendly and as instantaneous as the Geico Caveman-endorsed ""Remind Me"", but it was also up against increasingly significant competition from the emergent Scandinavian electro-pop scene. Junior is Röyksopp's third album in eight years and finds them synthesizing the highs and lows from their previous records to strike a knowing middle ground. While it might be oversimplifying matters to suggest that it splits the difference between the cute, poppy Röyksopp and the darker, techno-friendly Röyksopp, the most satisfying thing about Junior is how convincingly they've bridged that divide. In doing so, they've managed to solve the niggling problems inherent to Melody A.M. and The Understanding-- neither sickly sweet or unsuitably gloomy, Junior is arguably the pair's strongest album. If you're a production duo like Röyksopp, a lot of your success is dependent upon the singers you surround yourself with, and they've chosen wisely here: In addition to a pair of encore performances from Dreijer, Junior also includes turns from Robyn, Lykke Li, and frequent contributor Anneli Drecker. The high points are pretty much as you'd expect; Driejer does double duty, lending an uncharacteristically creamy falsetto to the disco-inflected workout ""This Must Be It"" as well as a typically nervy vocal to the double-timed horrorshow piece ""Tricky Tricky"". Elsewhere, Robyn overdelivers, accounting not only for the best track on the album, but possibly of the year: Influenced in equal parts by Italo disco and ""Blue Monday"", ""The Girl and the Robot"" is a frigid, winding bit of electro that combines a powerhouse vocal with some slippery chord changes and one of the biggest choruses of 2009 so far. Meanwhile, fans of Röyksopp's pop confectionaries needn't look farther than lead single ""Happy Up Here"", whose dumb, gloopy loop is so infectious that it manages to coast along without the aid of (or need for) any supporting song structure. The pair also hit with ""Röyksopp Forever"", a starry, string-aided instrumental that starts out sounding like a proggier, second-rate Air before saving itself with a legitimately momentous key change. Some of the other album cuts flirt with downtempo conventions to less flattering outcomes; in fact, if there are any criticisms to be made here, they probably have to do with Röyksopp's tendency to veer into over-produced tastefulness. The worst offender is probably ""Silver Cruiser"", which exposes the pair's overly finessed production skills and temporarily veers the record into Zero 7/Lemon Jelly/Groove Armada territory. Mostly, though, it's a divide they manage to stay on the right side of; if rumors are true and Junior is in the fact the companion to a slower, more ambient album called Senior due for release later this year, it'll be interesting to see just how long they can keep that up.","Röyksopp's third album finds them synthesizing the highs and lows from their previous records to strike a knowing middle ground.

Elvis Perkins in Dearland,Elvis Perkins in Dearland,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31e9d034d5c69bf2d4a/1:1/w_160/3e404b4d.jpg,2009-03-24 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12823-elvis-perkins-in-dearland/,XL,"Think of Elvis Perkins' music as a feat of structural engineering: Despite the massive weight of its cargo, it still manages to float, even cruise. His grief-drenched 2007 debut, Ash Wednesday, explicitly and covertly referenced the death of his photographer mother in the 9/11 attacks and his actor father's from AIDS complications a decade earlier. Yet the record wasn't really depressing. It was melancholy, ruminative, allusive, and droll perhaps but also amazingly light on its feet, thanks to the tasteful brass, strings, and percussion that skirted Perkins' reedy tenor and acoustic guitar. Lyrics are the sine qua non of the troubadour game, and Perkins has shown he has a skillful way with words. ""I waited for the riddled sky to be solved again by the sunrise/ I've made a death suit for life for my father's ill widowed wife"" he sang in ""While You Were Sleeping,"" the exquisitely moving Ash Wednesday opener that earned him the ""next Dylan"" albatross for his troubles. Track one is again the standout on second LP, Elvis Perkins in Dearland, an album that formally incorporates Perkins' three-piece touring band (among them, the trio play an impressive 10 instruments, including saxophone, harmonium, and clarinet). And if it wasn't already clear that the Dylan comparison is a nonstarter, Perkins proves an able bandleader, both charismatic and comfortable ceding the stage to his mates. Like a florescent bulb gradually growing to full vibrancy, ""Shampoo"" fades in on a dense swarm of whistles, strummed guitar and damp organ before a crisp, snapped snare kicks off the terrific folk-rocker proper. It's unambiguously a band, not a singer-songwriter, performance. The lyrics' opacity make it hard to say for sure, but I like to think ""Shampoo"" cites director Hal Ashby's 1975 comic yet caustic referendum on 60s counterculture (set on the cusp of Richard Nixon's 1968 election win), a film that begins as a sexual morality tale and ends as a mortality one. ""I don't want to die/ However dark tomorrow may be,"" Perkins sing-slurs from our own anxious political/cultural crossroads. Given his personal history, it's easy to imagine him, at that moment, as a sort of sacrificial lamb/prophet. As ""Shampoo"" hints (""Black is the color of my true love's arrow/ Black is the color of my blood"" inverts an amorous blues convention) Perkins has sloughed many of his earlier folk influences for the R&B base of nascent rock. On ""Hey"", the bopping upright bass, shadowy female harmonies (courtesy of Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark), and Perkins' strangulated basso profundo growl transport the song back half a century, or at least as far as the Fat Elvis era. ""Hours Last Stand"" is a straight-up Mississippi river-dredger (even if Perkins' voice will always sound more like Woody Guthrie's than Robert Johnson's); the bright and brassy ""Doomsday"" shoots for a New Orleans funeral vibe; and ""I Heard Your Voice in Dresden"" could be one of Buddy Holly's, replete with Lone Star hiccupped hollers. Decent as these tracks are, the rest of the album never quite lives up to ""Shampoo""'s potential. And songs like ""I'll Be Arriving"" and closer ""How's Forever Been Baby"", whose harmonica whine is more giggle-inducing than profound, are lead anchors. Fortunately, such maudlin moves are rare and Perkins' ability to air out material that continues to brood on death, abandonment and ordinary ol' breakups is a credit to his good songwriting and arranging. The guy's probably got a superb album in him; Dearland, however, isn't it.","On his second album, 4AD troubadour formally introduces his three-piece touring band, proving himself a charismatic bandleader in the process.

Money,Skeletons,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f5b1335d7bf16985ee/1:1/w_160/21dcb2da.jpg,2009-03-24 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12791-money/,Tomlab,"Since their Ghostly International debut, Git, Skeletons' out-funk has been getting increasingly muscled, sacrificing seasick idiosyncrasies for unshaved thickness. Money tips the scales further in that direction, presenting the band as aggressive lurkers pumping out distended sex-jams. Skeletons' last album, Lucas, came closer to greatness than you might expect of a band devoting a career to glitch-beat-gospel. Lucas' long-legged crawls through free jazz and group chants provided a charmingly decrepit counterpart to other fitful, urban creators like the Dirty Projectors. Money is the band's first album for Tomlab and their fifth overall, depending on your definition of album (like fellow New Yorkers Excepter, Skeletons have mastered the art of using the internet as both obscurant and portal to their art). Lead Skeleton Matthew Mehlan seems to have trimmed his small army of contributors to three regulars-- Jonathan Leland, Tony Lowe, and Jason McMahon-- all of whom contributed to Lucas as well. And Money continues an ongoing march toward stability, the Skeletons' lineup seemingly solidified and its name-- Skeletons has come appended with ""and the Girl-Faced Boys"" on ""Git"" and ""and the Kings of All Cities"" on Lucas-- left unchanged. (Should you want to re-convince yourself of the band's wide borders, know that the already ill-looking young girl on the album's cover is accompanied in the liners with full-panel drawings of cupped breasts and vaginal penetration.) Mehlan's always been a little sex-brained-- see Lucas' ""Fake Tits""-- so funk is a natural, heh, bedfellow, but Money seeks that genre's fitful skronk more than its rubbery rhythms. ""The THINGS"" opens with rumbling, moaning brass and sharp, tinny guitars. ""Fill My Pockets Full"" builds a small cacophony out of blasts of city-noise-- car horns, street chatter-- and two notes on a nervous piano. ""Dripper"" makes skittish, jazzy runs on an acoustic guitar. Money is a fitting title for the album, and it's worth wondering if Mehlan's been feeling the predictable strains of the consistently creative. His prayers and petitions are eminently practical: ""Fill my pockets full/ My fridge with food to eat,"" he sings. Later, during ""STEPPER (aka Work)"", Mehlan sings, ""I'm gonna get paid enough to survive so I quit complaining for once in my life,"" slurring the ""paid"" as his band carves out a small strut. So Money's most alluring, come-hither track-- ""STEPPER""-- is a song about sticking with shit situations, but much of the album feels exclusive and angry in both sound and thought. Mehlan used to be charmingly offbeat, his city-hippie poses weird and welcoming. ""Why would I want to know these things/ The children of rich men know these things,"" Mehlan spits during ""The THINGS"", but that pales in comparison to the prickle Skeletons display during ""Eleven (IT'll RAIN)"", which abandons its pop-whimsy opening moments for caterwauling screams before returning to a Latin-leaning, horn-led coda. ""Unrelentinglessness"" caws slowly, contrary to its title, with Mehlan's nasal whinny sounding like a detriment over the track's un-tuned nonsense. ""BOOOM! (Money)"" (at least Mehlan has a healthy sense of humor about the green) hurries through wearying, chippy verses before launching seven minutes of quesey jamming in which Skeletons actually sound like they're beating nod-able rhythms back with their instruments. Money is full of tracks like this, songs in which Mehlan abandons poetry or eloquence, slumping his shoulders during cluttered, unspoken passages. ""BOOOM!"" is the sour gristle at the center, a brawny, stuffy album that sees Mehlan turn his wide-eyed creativity toward big adult messes. Money is no less creative or searching than Skeletons' previous works, but it trades too many of their fantastical charms for scurrying reality.","Out-funk band's first album for Tomlab and fifth overall presents it as aggressive lurkers pumping out distended sex jams.

The band has released consistently strong albums since its 2000 inception and garnered high praise from their countrymen-- up against Aussie faves Wolfmother and the Go-Betweens, they won the inaugural Australian Music Prize for their 2005 record Wait Long by the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By-- but still are mostly unknown to European and American listeners. It's hard to say precisely what accounts for this disconnect, but I propose a name change might be in order: there's nothing drone-y about what these guys do. Despite what their moniker suggests, the Drones are a high-velocity garage-blues act-- something like Gun Club with punk swapped out for capital-H hard rock. They're traditional in the way Black Lips are-- straightforward instrumentation, a healthy nod to the past-- but manage to dodge the pitfalls of revisionism with an unusual mixture of brute force, bleak lyrical content, and singer Gareth Liddiard's distinctive caterwaul. (Dude can impressively shift from a bark to a shriek to a roar in one solitary breath.) It's an intense concoction that casual indie fans will probably find abrasive, but a degree of unfriendliness seems to be part of the group's M.O. Previous records emphasized the Drones' fierceness with mostly aggressive tracks, and while Havilah (their fifth) trades some of that for slower, dirge-like pieces, they start the album with a bang... literally. Opener ""Nail It Down"" rumbles for a few minutes before launching a violent guitar-and-drum assault. That energy carries over to ""The Minotaur"", a song that's equally wicked sounding but contains moments of well-placed melody to keep it from becoming overbearing. Oddly catchy, these songs aren't totally dissimilar from the harder-edged moments of bands such as Queens of the Stone Age, but with the Drones' oft-stated distaste for the human race and lyrics like ""People are a waste of food/ They're only ever happy when they're burying their friends"" (from ""Oh My""), it's hard to imagine them getting played on KROQ anytime soon. Havilah broadens the Drones' sonic palette and continues to carve out a sound that is uniquely theirs, and in that sense it's an accomplishment, but wrestling with the record's dark subject matter makes it a difficult listen. This is especially the case on unhurried, acoustic tracks like ""I Am the Supercargo"" where the vocals sit upfront in the mix and there's no captivating rock melody to latch onto. There's nothing to feel chipper about ""The Drifting Housewife"", for instance, where Liddiard contemplates a failed marriage over a twang-y Neil Young-inspired ballad. ""I was more worried about taxes when my lovely red-eyed bride became a hairsplitting believer that I should be vilified,"" he sings. Nope, that doesn't sound like a healthy relationship. The record's back-end is where most of its slower material resides-- the very dark stretch that begins with ""Cold and Sober"" and closes with ""Penumbra"" will be the most trying for listeners. These tracks (and the lingering, amber-hued ""Luck in the Odd Numbers"" between them) show the group at their most frustrated and fatigued. Lyrically, at least, it's pretty brutal stuff. Closer ""Your Acting's Like the End of the World"" finally provides some light at the end of the tunnel, where Liddiard sings, ""All this doom and gloom has got to me/ I can't take another punch"", and we're with him there, but surely some won't make it to that point. I'd suggest trying to stick it out, though. Enduring this album is a bit like making it through a powerful-but-disturbing film. It might make you uncomfortable and you'll probably never watch it again, but you're at least glad you saw it.","Well known in Australia, this high-velocity garage-blues act is still all-too-overlooked elsewhere.

Early Output: 1996-1998,Fridge,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3459d034d5c69bf2d9b/1:1/w_160/9a37bc09.jpg,2009-03-24 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12854-early-output-1996-1998/,Temporary Residence,"Most music lovers agree there's something satisfying about hearing a band you like in the developmental stages of its career. Unfettered by the burgeoning expectations of their fans and, most vitally, themselves, the baby steps of a new musical project are often at their most powerful with reflection, when you locate how early records helped build a band's character-- think, for example, of Sonic Youth's Confusion Is Sex, Pink Floyd's Outtakes From Outer Space, or Touch and Go's compilation of the Jesus Lizard's early recordings, Head/Pure. While early material may not be the highlight of a group's discography, it's here that listeners often find their boldest, most uncompromising, and experimental work. It is the charm of a new beginning, the first marks on a blank canvas. This is acknowledged by Fridge bass player turned solo artist Adem Ilhan in the evocative liner notes to Early Output 1996-1998: ""(We were) trying to make music that didn't sound like anything else; all of us not quite skilled enough to translate the sound in our head onto cassette, but creatively filling the gaps, using them and making them integral."" This pretty much sums up the appeal of this collection of Fridge's rare early releases on Trevor Jackson's now-disbanded Output Recordings imprint. Paired with six previously unreleased tracks, Early Output 1996-1998 is the sound of a young band holed up in a south London basement with limited gear, finding itself through extended improvisations and trial-and-error composition. While the material doesn't match up to their finest album, Happiness (2001), it's interesting to hear what the English post-rock trio were up to and influenced by while bands such as Tortoise and Do Make Say Think were experimenting in a similar field on the other side of the pond. Comprising Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, Ilhan, and drummer Sam Jeffers, Fridge are known for bringing color to their brilliant, rhythm focused experimental rock with heavy sampling, a predilection that really came into the foreground around the release of their third album, Eph. The building blocks of their initial sample dabbling are evident here though, creeping stealthily in and out of songs such as ""Helicopter"" and the thorny assault of distortion on ""Cassette"". Although Early Output 1996-1998 is more of a thoroughly enjoyable thought piece for Fridge/Four Tet/Adem fans rather than a solid introduction to the group's work, the 21 tracks on offer, which are arranged in chronological order, show an incredible musical range for a largely self-taught band whose members were barely out of their teens. On ambient, bass-anchored songs like ""Zedex Ay Ti Wan"" and the 15-minute krautrock freak-out ""Anglepoised"" the trio sound like they're channeling Can, yet a little later their sound is drenched in robotic funk on ""For Force"", and towards the end the listener is led through a sonic jungle of grunge influenced power chords on ""Swerve and Spin"", plus a spat of tracks that run just shy of a minute and consist purely of gnarly feedback. The greatest pleasure of Early Output 1996-1998 is hearing just how much Fridge are enjoying themselves as they confront their technical limitations, take the bull by the horns, and set out on the path that led to the members' impressively innovative careers both in Fridge and their respective solo projects. It's patchy at times, as one would expect, but feeds on the fire of youth and the result is passionate and elegantly playful.","The post-rock band that included Four Tet and Adem collects its initial releases, plus unreleased tracks.

Grace/Wastelands,Peter Doherty,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34913d1975652138a5e/1:1/w_160/47e54a61.jpg,2009-03-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12857-gracewastelands/,Parlophone,"Eminem said it best: ""Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs."" I'd certainly prefer to think of a more original way to introduce a Pete Doherty solo album, but it's not like he's left me much choice. And besides, ""tired"" shows up twice as much as ""drugs,"" because it's really exhaustion that defines following Doherty: Either you're tired of the questionable appendage of ""genius"" to ""smack-addled,"" or you're tired of nearly everything Doherty's done since Up the Bracket being a vehicle for laments on how far off the grid he's gone. So no surprise that Doherty's sobriety (his game is grown, prefer you call him ""Peter"") is the biggest selling point for Grace/Wasteland as opposed to its long-time-coming partnerships with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon and famed producer Stephen Street (the Smiths, Blur). Imagining an alternate reality where ""Radio America"" was the jumping off point for the rest of his career, Grace is a record that splits the difference between its collaborators: Though largely acoustic and peppered with plenty UK signifiers of string pads, light drums, horns, and shuffle/skiffle tempos, its production resembles that of any Coxon solo record, closely mic'd to the point where everything sounds smudged. As Doherty's voice continues to take on a sort of empathetic piteousness, this sort of unkempt sonic rendering adds a humanizing touch. None of which excuses the main problem with Grace/Wastelands-- an absence of memorable songs. It's a new beginning and a definitive closing as some of Grace is taken from songs that have aged more than five years. Either way, it's hard to tell what's been written in a week and which ones come with a ratpack stench. Though ""A Little Death Around the Eyes"" has a slinky seductiveness, it's saddled with lyrics that are pure placeholder-- ""Your boyfriend's name was Dave/ I was bold and brave/ And now you're mine."" Other times, the influence of Coxon manifests in a tendency to stuff as many chord changes into a verse regardless of whether Doherty can think up a decent melody to lay on top of it. Most of the time, he's not up to task, as on ""1939 Returning"", which details the plight of a World War II soldier turned dissident without paying much attention to writing hooks. More successful is ""The Last of the English Roses"", which combines the strongest melody with the most intriguing arrangement. It's also the most far removed from anything Dohetry's tried to date, riding a distant melodica (is there any other kind?) and a Paul Simonon-style dubby bass over a Madchester beat into something that could play in the same junkyard as Simonon's Damon Albarn collaborations with the Good, the Bad & the Queen. But the lyrical bookends of Grace/Wastelands suggest that Doherty hasn't kicked his tendency to plant Easter egg lyrics to the point of distraction. Each with a wink, the record is bookended with an antiquated ideas of escape-- the pastoral escape plan ""Arcady"" bemoans when you've outgrown your teachers with a loaded, sophomoric reference to ""seraphic pipes"" and closer ""New Love Grows on Trees"" turns 25 into the new 50 with a plea for a death sentence. And then there's ""Sheepskin Tearaway"" and the flatulent music hall number ""Sweet By and By"" which prop themselves up on the assumption that you have any interest in hearing the last bit of gristle picked from his beefs with Kate Moss and the Libertines. Still, best thing he's done since the debut? Well, sure-- regardless of what exactly that means, it can be viewed as a comeback and one that can keep his cottage industry chugging along. Problem is, the more traditionally reflective Grace/Wastelands just manages to make his solipsism double over on itself and your memories of listening to Up the Bracket are more rewarding than his memories of making it.","Ex-Libertine enlists Graham Coxon and Stephen Street, but the story here is still his self-aware yet not terribly insightful approach to his own sobriety.

Advance Base Battery Life,Casiotone for the Painfully Alone,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31ac0084474cd0c01d4/1:1/w_160/ca708929.jpg,2009-03-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12821-advance-base-battery-life/,Tomlab,"With a proper release of new songs due in less than a month, you might wonder why Owen Ashworth, the man behind Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, feels the need to release this collection of singles and rarities now. The reason seems to be threefold. The clearest reason is necessity: The 15 songs on Advance Base Battery Life are culled from three years of contributions to split 7""s and compilation albums-- all but two are on CD for the first time here. Also, the compilation shows off the sheer size of Ashworth's output. From 2004 through 2007 (the period that Battery Life covers), he released two full-lengths, but he also released almost as many songs outside of those albums as on them. Anyone who has complained that the three-year absence between CFTPA albums was too long will now bite their tongues, considering that this collection proves just how busy Ashworth has been. And finally, with the forthcoming Vs. Children adding new instruments and mostly avoiding the lo-fi keyboards from which the band takes its name, it seems like Battery Life is a last hurrah of sorts, a good reminder of how Ashworth has made so much out of so little for so long. Though the expected tracks of washed-out vocals, shimmery keyboards, lonely drum machine thumps, and efficiently told tales of romantic disappointment abound, there are also surprises here. ""The Only Way to Cry"" is a 46-second blip of bedroom-recorded, droning keyboards that would play as novelty if its sentiment wasn't so strangely moving. Succinct like a musical haiku, its tells its story in only five lines, but its economy of language makes the tale of a man who buys out a movie theater just so he can have a good cry alone even more affecting. And ""Holly Hobby"" flips the script on Ashworth's usual ""why isn't she with me"" storyline, indulging in his inner manly heartlessness with a blunt monologue to a girl whom he's treated the way he's always complaining that he is: discarded and unappreciated. ""I'm sorry that you fell/ But you should have known just as well/ That you're just a hobby, Holly,"" he sings against a disarmingly sweet synthesizer melody. The covers that backload the album-- Missy Elliott's ""Hot Boyz"", Paul Simon's ""Graceland"", and Bruce Springsteen's ""Streets of Philadelphia"" and ""Born in the U.S.A.""-- act as added evidence for Ashworth's style, proving that even the biggest hits of the uber-masculine Boss can sound fragile and vulnerable when buried in layers of distortion and stripped of all studio gloss. The Missy cover is especially ingenious, keeping the rhythmic heaviness and playful skittering drum line of the original, but adding the slightly bored, girlish vocals of Dear Nora's Katy Davidson to undercut all the lyrical consumer-porn. That said, Advance Base Battery Life is not likely to earn Ashworth many new fans. If you already have little patience for his mumbled delivery, devastatingly astute observations of the banalities of slacker life, and amateur production technique (or lack thereof), then you won't be swayed by these buzzing, muffled tracks. But those who already like his sorrowful whispers will find these intimate odes to ennui stirring and sad. The good news for the haters, however, is that, with the impending arrival of the more floridly arranged Vs. Children, this album might be the last bow for Ashworth's Casiotone, which, it seems, may no longer be so painfully alone after all.","Just a month before his latest record of new songs, Casiotone offers this collection of singles and rarities.

White Bird Release,Pan American,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c1b1335d7bf1698579/1:1/w_160/fb9eaadc.jpeg,2009-03-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12750-white-bird-release/,Kranky,"Kranky has had its share of unlikely successes-- from Godspeed You! Black Emperor to, more recently, Deerhunter-- but from the start the concept behind the label has been pretty consistent: They sign what they like. In fact, as recalled in a recent Pitchfork interview, label founders Bruce Adams and Joel Leoschke originally formed Kranky specifically to distribute their discovery Labradford, and the rest rolled out from there. Other bands have brought it more money or attention, but looking back to its roots, Kranky remains the record label that Labradford built. Alas, Labradford went on indefinite (if unofficial) hiatus back in 2001, but vocalist/guitarist Mark Nelson has continued to release records as Pan American, a close cousin to Labradford's trademark drone and drift. Given Nelson's minimalist métier, it's a wonder he's been able to get the mileage out of his music that he has. Yet Nelson's work as Pan American has been admirably consistent in tone if somewhat uneven in quality. The excellent 2004 release, Quiet City, for example, re-imagined Labradford as a radical chamber outfit (albeit still draped in static and gauze). But 2006's oblique meditation on fatherhood, For Waiting, For Chasing, was virtually weightless in its ambient approximation of amniotic stasis. Pan American is a small-scale project in every sense and only a fan could explain the differences between one album and the next. But by this point, it seems safe to say that Nelson is probably not out to make new converts. The new White Bird Release isn't nearly as passive as its predecessor, but at the same time, it does often hew closer to linear ambient drift compared to the dub-inflected early Pan American releases or Nelson's subtle experiments in rhythm. At times, the album recalls Eno's mysterious but organic opus Ambient 4: On Land. Other times it's more modern and digital, like something from Kompakt's pop ambient stable (with an even less-defined pulse). Throughout, however, it's proof of how ambient music can benefit from a songwriter's disciplined ear and instinct for concision. White Bird Release, while not as conceptual as For Waiting, For Chasing, almost by default flows as a sort of suite, with each track named after a fragment of this quotation: ""There can be no thought of finishing for 'aiming at the stars"" both literally and figuratively is a problem to occupy generations so that no matter how much progress one makes there is always the thrill of just beginning-- Dr. Robert Goddard in a letter to HG Wells, 1932."" (Labradford used a similar trick ten years ago on E Luxo So, using the album credits as song titles.) Just what bearing each track has on the next-- track one is ""There Can Be No Thought of Finishing"", track two is called ""For 'Aiming at the Stars'"", and so on-- is unclear, other than to emphasize rocket scientist Goddard's awed contemplation of infinity. Much ambient music serves a similar purpose, designed to float and mingle in the background almost invisibly, like it's part of the very air we breathe. Nelson is as guilty as anyone of occasionally making music seemingly designed to disappear. In its own quiet way, however, White Bird Release knows how to call attention to itself. ""There Can Be No Thought of Finishing"" begins with a thoughtful and pretty tremolo guitar melody, enhanced by Nelson's whispered vocals, but ends butting up against some discordant digital noise and echoing, almost random percussion. ""For 'Aiming at the Stars'"" starts as a repetitive homage to Frippertronics-- Nelsontronics?-- before a rubbery bass figure pulls the minimal melody in new directions. ""Both Literally and Figuratively"" pulls off a similar trick, congealing into something close to a traditional song, replete with rhythm section, halfway through. ""Is a Problem to Occupy Generations"" may be not much more than hum and hiss. But it helps emphasize the pacific Nelsontronics piece ""So That No Matter"" before ""How Much Progress One Makes"" conflates all the impressive qualities that have marked past Labradford and Pan American releases into an impressive, deceptively propulsive whole. The static-filled noir of ""There Is Always the Thrill of Just Beginning"" and the Zen-inducing ""Dr. Robert Goddard"" ease the disc down gently, illustrating the beauty to be found between the notes, while ""In a Letter to H. G. Wells, 1932"" highlights the soulful essence-- invisible but present nonetheless-- in all the empty spaces and near-silence. ""It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow,"" said Goddard, who spent his life bringing mankind closer to outer space. One imagines White Bird Release would have therefore left him impressed, since it, like the best ambient music, achieves what once was considered impossible: With the ease of an old hand, the ever-steady Nelson brings the awesome and infinite recesses of space down to earth.","The latest solo project from Labradord's Mark Nelson is proof of how ambient music can benefit from a songwriter's disciplined ear and instinct for concision.

Static Tensions,Kylesa,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a307ea9e61561daa4bac/1:1/w_160/a589137c.jpeg,2009-03-23 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12807-static-tensions/,Prosthetic,"If the world were just, Kylesa would be a household name. Fellow Georgians Mastodon have rocketed to fame due to hard work, press hype, and acceptance by non-metalheads. Fellow Savannians Baroness have earned plaudits due to a sound that's more classic rock than metal. Kylesa, too, have alloyed sludge metal with melody and finesse. Their star, though, has brightened more slowly. After four albums and thousands of road miles logged, its shine has become brilliant. Kylesa formed in 2001. From the beginning, it was somewhat of a mutt. Hardcore punk, crust punk, caveman metal, and rough-hewn prog did battle on its self-titled debut. 2005's To Walk a Middle Course was darker, dragging sludge metal through murky depths. The following year's Time Will Fuse Its Worth was a breakthrough for several reasons. First, its production was relatively clear, exposing diverse elements: flashes of psychedelia, dueling male and female vocals, punk and metal at each other's throats. Second, it was Kylesa's first album with two drummers. At that time, though, their impact was greater live than on record. Most importantly, the band discovered catchiness. ""Hollow Severer"" found guitarist/vocalist Phillip Cope carrying an actual tune, and its video got MTV exposure. The lessons learned are manifest on Static Tensions. In the past, Kylesa's songs were often about a minute too long. Their head-down pounding worked well live, but dragged on record. Now riffs repeat only when necessary. Songs climb up and down with relentless momentum. ""Scapegoat"", for example, is basically a hardcore punk two-step. But despite this newfound efficiency, the songs are more baroque than ever. They flaunt melodies shamelessly now. Choruses are insistent. Practically the whole record is hummable. The bright theme of ""Unknown Awareness"" arcs like a rainbow overhead. ""Running Red"" alternates Slayer harmonies with riffs redolent of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"". Laura Pleasants' singing, once a buried gem, is often upfront. She ranges from a mysterious coo to more forceful declamation. Both provide a feminine contrast to roiling, downtuned riffs underneath. Headphones, or a good stereo, reveal this record's masterstroke: production that mostly separates the drummers hard left and right. This yields both greater clarity and density. Together, the drummers form a prickly thicket of percussion. But they often separate into rich counterpoint. ""Said and Done"", for example, pits blastbeats on the left against slow accents on the right. They're playing in time, but they're almost fighting each other. The body is torn as to how to react. Such push and pull echoes Kylesa's lyrical obsession with time. Yesterday and tomorrow are common concerns. The specter of aging haunts this record, with repeated references to fading away. ""Insomnia for Months"" swims in a haze of ""Multitude of memories/ Left in a stupor/ Sobriety out of boredom."" But the delivery is sharp, with ride cymbals cutting through tumbling syncopations. Kylesa's lyrics lean towards the abstract and personal. They avoid grand gestures or obvious themes that allow for easy grasp. (Contrast, for example, Mastodon and mythology.) This time, though, grasp is almost moot. The band has etched light, dark, sky, and earth so deftly onto wax that it vibrates the very soul.","Like fellow Georgians Mastodon and Baroness, Kylesa have brilliantly alloyed sludge metal with melody and finesse.

The Proper Sex,I.U.D.,by: Mike Powell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34813d1975652138a58/1:1/w_160/7bf12887.jpg,2009-03-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12856-the-proper-sex/,Social Registry,"The Proper Sex is the debut full-length from I.U.D., a duo of Lizzi Bougatsos of Gang Gang Dance and Sadie Laska from Growing. It's a purposefully messy and undirected record that sounds like early Boredoms and industrial music. I have tried listening to it sitting down, standing up, on the bus, in my room, fixing soup, just before bed, and just after my morning coffee, and I don't like it very much. I will humbly try and explain why. Growing is a drum-less project that, at best, makes rippling, druggy, and exquisitely loud drone music. Gang Gang Dance is, like Animal Collective, a hip, urbane band trying to integrate non-Western dance rhythms into experimental pop. Both are self-consciously progressive but take comfort in the past-- Growing in early ambient music and the sublime patterns of 1970s composition, and Gang Gang Dance in post-punk and no wave's tribal outliers. I.U.D. is a side project that will be marketed based on its members (even in this review's homepage blurb), but it doesn't share a lot of common ground with either Gang Gang Dance or Growing. As a listener and writer, this is a simple but frustrating position to be in. Just because I own leather boots does not mean I want a hamburger. But if I give the hamburger a try and don't like it, my waiter will remind me that I ordered a hamburger not leather boots. Admittedly, that's not the cow's fault. And yet there's a latent, dangerous fascination to stuff like side projects and stylistic departures-- Lil Wayne's terrible, post–Axe body spray rock music is interesting because it was made by Lil Wayne and not by a contractor who downgraded to day-old bread at Food Lion for a year to be able to afford Pro Tools. This is the sad, populous border at which audiences forsake the experience of music to psychologize and contextualize. If I'm listening to I.U.D. fairly, they sound like a band with goals: music that feels animalistic but self-aware, chaotic but controlled. Most of the songs are built from layered shrieks, thuds, and samples. No real melodies, few discernible lyrics. The best tracks on The Proper Sex sound great on headphones-- the dense, spirited bricks of ""Glo Balls"" or ""911"", for example, where drums and voices tumble across the sound field, demanding attention for an instant before being wrestled aside. These are moments of violence and vitality. These are moments where I don't even register that I'm listening to I.U.D., let alone a Gang Gang Dance/Growing side project-- a full-on nightmare state that fellow New Yorkers Excepter and Black Dice have been chasing for nearly a decade. But most of The Proper Sex is conducted with the compassion of a bank transaction: distracted, a little inert, a little perfunctory. I know, I should be taking I.U.D. at face value. Maybe the loping ""Girls Just Wanna (Time to Have Sex)"" and ""Monk Hummer""-- 11 and 8 minutes, respectively-- are supposed to lack... climax. In that case, it's blasé, threat-less industrial music, a concept with no more internal logic than skydiving from 20 feet. Ultimately, The Proper Sex sounds like a lark: harmless and a little ignorable for everyone involved; perfectly irrelevant; gravy-- in a way, just what you'd expect from a side project.","The Proper Sex is the debut full-length from I.U.D., a duo of Lizzi Bougatsos of Gang Gang Dance and Sadie Laska from Growing.

The Hazards of Love,The Decemberists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a335b1335d7bf1698693/1:1/w_160/b9e13686.jpg,2009-03-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/,Capitol,"Nobody got into the Decemberists for the riffs. In other ways, though, the theatrical Portland folk-rockers' noble sojourn into heavy narrative prog-folk was probably always in the stars. Ornately antiquarian diction was their Ziggy Stardust. Ginormous song suites based on world folklore were their deaf, dumb, and blind kid. Yes, they were meant for The Wall. In an interview with Paste, singing guitarist/songwriter Colin Meloy mentioned that The Hazards of Love was ""initially conceived as a musical... but I decided about halfway through my time in France that it wasn't going to work as a stage piece. But it would still work as a rock record, so that's where it ended up."" Alas, for all the derring-do of the Decemberists' resolutely un-sold-out (I guess?) fifth album, its failures as a stage piece may explain some of the problems that hamper it as a rock record. It makes sense that the Decemberists would end up here. A willingness to make their fans put in some work, whether with fancy language or sprawling song suites, has been part of their steez ever since the baroque reveries of 2002 debut Castaways and Cutouts and stagey bookishness of 2003 breakthrough Her Majesty-- both of which still kick pantaloon. After 2004's The Tain EP flashed the first signs of metalhead envy, Picaresque a year later ended the Decemberists' indie years with their most relatable and poppiest album (still my favorite of theirs). Capitol debut The Crane Wife showed no symptoms of what Meloy had termed ""major-label sellout-itis"". The Hazards of Love, inspired by UK folkie Anne Briggs' 1966 EP of the same name, has thick stoner-metal sludge and peat-bogged prog-folk arpeggios. Tucker Martine, who mixed The Crane Wife, produces exactly right for the material, focusing on the songs. Multi-instrumentalist Jenny Conlee and bassist Nate Query add several string arrangements. Robyn Hitchcock adds subtle electric guitar textures on an instrumental interlude, and My Morning Jacket's Jim James and the Spinanes' Rebecca Gates are in there somewhere, too. Still, although the album's grandiose narrative about star-crossed lovers William and Margaret-- and the dastardly villains who beset them-- has some nice twists, it's not exactly Andrew Lloyd Webber. Usually here's where I'm supposed to say, ""That's OK, you don't have to follow the plot, because the songs stand on their own""-- except, with a few exceptions, they don't, not quite. It doesn't simplify things that Meloy sings the parts of multiple characters, also including ""First Voice"" and ""The Rake"". The blessedly thorough lyric sheet makes advance mp3s like dark infanticide memoir ""The Rake's Song"" a lot funnier, full of witty wordplay (""I was wedded and it whetted my thirst"") and sly foreshadowing (""You think that I would be haunted""-- he will be), but reading isn't the same as listening. Too much work, not enough payoff. (Hmm, imagine that.) Not that the Decemberists' latest has anywhere near the smugness that haters might wrongly expect-- they sang ""California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade"", calling ""all bed wetters"", after all. ""The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid"", in which Meloy's William argues against the Queen to set him free to be with his beloved, has blazing classic-rock riffs and a commanding vocal by My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden. (The reprise is less essential, unless you're still following the plot.) Worden returns on the ""The Queen's Rebuke/The Crossing"", which has blistering dynamic shifts, an organ solo, and plenty of lurching Black Mountain heaviness. Surprisingly, it all sounds like the Decemberists, at least if you've been paying attention over the years. For the love songs, then, The Hazards of Love puts on some Nashville twang. Pedal steel cries alongside swaying accordion on ""Isn't it a Lovely Night?"", with a precious post-orgasm (post-Pete & the Pirates?) pun. As the pregnant Margaret, Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark is a welcome pairing for Meloy, smiling with Princess Bride-like serenity through her worries on ""Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)""; Meloy's voice is at its vulnerable best on the trembling meadow-makeout ballad ""The Hazards of Love 2 (Wager All)"". I can take the undead children chanting on ""The Hazards of Love 3 (Revenge!)"", but not the watery wedding vows on the drunken finale-- what can I say, I really, really didn't like Titanic. Enough happens musically on The Hazards of Love that I can still see it being fun for fans in a live setting, especially if you know the lyrics. On disc, though, it's largely missing the catchy choruses and verisimilar emotions that previously served as ballast for the Decemberists' gaudy eccentricities. As a turn toward metal, The Tain EP's smaller portion was more satisfying-- although, as mid-career change-ups go, this is still a fair piece more enjoyable than something like MMJ's Evil Urges. ""Doing The Hazards of Love took a lot out of me,"" Meloy confides in the press bio. ""And I'm definitely curious what will come out now that I've got this out of my system."" The Decemberists already released three non-album singles last year, compiled as the Always the Bridesmaid EP; ""Sleepless"", a lovely orchestral lullaby from the recent Dark Was the Night charity compilation, suggests the Decemberists still have plenty more nautical epics to perform. ""I've got nothing to hold onto,"" Meloy sings. A friend of Bobby McGee's once called that feeling freedom, and it only took a four-and-a-half-minute song.","Always defined by their eccentricities, the Decemberists offer a tangled narrative set to thick stoner-metal sludge and prog-folk arpeggios.

Lamb's Anger,Mr. Oizo,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e513d1975652138983/1:1/w_160/a7ef9948.jpeg,2009-03-20 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12778-lambs-anger/,Ed Banger,"In 1999, French producer Quentin Dupieux, aka Mr. Oizo, propelled his song ""Flat Beat"" to the top of the UK charts by placing it in a trendily absurd Levi's commercial. The ad, which Dupieux directed, featured a puppet named Flat Eric bobbing his little yellow head to a skidding, shuddering bassline. That's him on this album's cover, about to get eye-sliced Un Chien Andalou- style. This seems to impy that Mr. Oizo is putting Flat Eric-- and perhaps the catchy, irritating style of ""Flat Beat""-- out to pasture for good. But this turns out not to be the case. If you can remember (or YouTube) that commercial, then you already have a good idea of what to expect from Lamb's Anger: cockamamie bass patterns that zoom and stutter, ear-grating trebles punching in, and a sense of going nowhere fast on Daft Punk's fumes. The album seems intent on emphasizing its own annoying qualities; you start to wonder if Oizo is secretly a minimalist trying to destroy French touch from the inside. Overblown and frantic, with a surplus of sounds and a dearth of ideas, Lamb's Anger too often falls back on cliché, and a shrieking, nerve-shredding resgister. There are hideous vocoder mumbles on ""Hun"", arpeggios based on an idea of funk derived from the ""Seinfeld"" theme on ""Z"" and ""W"", schmaltzy guitar and horn licks on ""Cut Dick"", cynically hedonistic club raps on ""Steroids"" and ""Two Takes It"" (the former a snap-music-inspired Uffie vehicle, the latter an electro flip of Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's ""It Takes Two"" featuring Carmen Castro, who's either a spot-on Uffie imitator or just Uffie under a pseudonym). There are antagonistically ugly synth tones bleating all over the place, and squealing soul-diva cuts on the astonishingly cluttered ""Gay Dentist"", which sounds like a C + C Music Factory song imported to iTunes from a badly scratched CD. It isn't the only track that verges on open hostility; See how long you can withstand ""Blind Concerto"", with which Oizo closes the album, as if maliciously farting on his way out of the room. The most lucid and listenable tracks are the smoother ones-- the aforementioned ""Cut Dick"", and the breezy lite-funk of ""Jo"", a blatant approximation of the Field. A handful of experimental pieces, like the ominous rave-siren workout ""Bruce Willis Is Dead"", fare better than the club songs, simply because they're supposed to be incoherent. But they suffer from the same structural deficiency; namely, a profound lack of communication between adjacent loops, which are so isolated that they might as well have picket fences between them. Most tracks consist of rigid repetitions of a single basic theme, afflicted with every rhythmic convulsion and soft-synth tone imaginable. There's a glut of movement within each bar, but little sense of movement across the bars, no overarching pulse or momentum. This constant feeling of starting over at every one-beat is exhausting, and makes the music seem at once predictable and erratic. Groups like Justice do tooth-grindingly obnoxious machine-noise anthems right, a thrilling hair's breadth away from too-muchness. But handled this clumsily, this ungenerously? There's not enough cocaine in the whole wide world.","Ten years after Levi's and Flat Eric, Mr. Oizo issues his latest via French touch linchpin Ed Banger Records.

Pierced,David Lang,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e05e6ef95969320509/1:1/w_160/aceae9ff.jpeg,2009-03-20 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12774-pierced/,Naxos,"David Lang, alongside Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, founded Bang on a Can in 1987 for the same reason most contemporary composers organize ensembles-- to hear someone play their music. Twenty-two years later, ""Bang on a Can"" has become as much a movement as an organization, having gathered forces and expanded in all directions with a tenacity that would impress the Wu-Tang Clan. Despite their countless offshoots, side projects, collaborations, and a growing number of disciples, Lang, Wolfe, and Gordon remain the beating heart of BoAC, and their shared aesthetic has come to define a wide slice of the American contemporary classical scene. The three tend to subsume their individual efforts into the collective, so it is enlightening and refreshing to hear when one of them breaks off on their own. Lang's music, released mostly on the BoAC's Cantaloupe label, does arguably the clearest job of defining the ""Bang on a Can"" sound of the three. If we're sticking with the Wu-Tang analogy, then Lang is the GZA figure, the one who most deftly negotiates all of the quirks and contradictions that make BoAC's world worthwhile and interesting. Pierced is a further refinement on that world, a place steeped in both the New York rock and the minimalism of the 70s without being overly indebted to either, an ingenious meld of film-score ambience, rock propulsion, and minimalist textures. Lang's pieces come in two basic varieties: rippling, liquid, and quietly restless (""My Very Empty Mouth"", ""Sweet Air"", both off of 2003's excellent Child ) and chattering, agitated, and bustling. The works on Pierced fall mostly in the latter category, which can make it a tougher listen. The title track, for example, is a near-exhausting exercise in rhythmic rug-pulling, a hard downbeat switching accents every few bars while strings shudder and groan like a leaky barge and a piano endlessly hammers a low note. The piece lurches in place for almost 14 minutes, an equal parts maddening and absorbing shell game of ""where's-the-beat?"" ""Cheating, Lying, Stealing"", an older work, has a similarly spiky hide, bristling with nervously stuttering piano, low bass-clarinet blats, and feedback squalls, all scored by the bangs and clunks of scrapyard-metal percussion. It resembles the sort of bracing urban chaos that Industrial Age composers like George Antheil sought to capture in his 1924 Ballet Mecanique, except that here the machinery has rusted and grown creaky with age. There is a long, mournful moment of repose, though, in Lang's startling reworking of the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"". Art-rock legends and classical composers often make dicey bedfellows, but Lang wisely avoids trying to win cool contests against Lou Reed. Maintaining the original's trancelike quality, he ditches everything else, recasting the song for the hauntingly pure-voiced singer/composer Theo Bleckmann and a single cellist. The result resembles a cross between an English Renaissance ballad and a Chet Baker-style torch song, stripping away the thin veil of bravado and leaving only piercing sadness. The only work that directly references rock music, it's also the most ""traditional""-sounding piece of classical music on the album, a canny switch-up that demonstrates how comfortable Lang is in the cross-genre slipstream. The album isn't perfect-- there are a few dead patches towards the end-- but Lang, who won the Pulitzer in 2008 for his Little Match Girl Passion, remains the rare Downtown composer who has managed to enter the Uptown world of big-name commissions and hefty grants with both his spirit and voice intact.","Bang on a Can co-leader makes a refreshing and rare foray into solo territory.

Born Radical,Friendly Foes,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e75e6ef95969320519/1:1/w_160/feee2c90.jpg,2009-03-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12780-born-radical/,Gangplank,"Rarely on a rock record has the adage ""write what you know"" been put to such good use as it has on the debut by Friendly Foes, the newest project of Ryan Allen of Thunderbirds Are Now!. Despite some notable exceptions (Art Brut's ""Formed a Band"", Pavement's ""Range Life"", Jackson Browne's ""The Load-Out"" among them), the ratio of great bands to great songs about being in a band is still remarkably small. But astonishingly, this Detroit-area trio has created not just one catchy track about the journeyman's life, but a song cycle of sorts of vigorous, stupidly sloppy power-pop that deals explicitly with the details of life in a rock band. Perhaps this is because, between its three members, Friendly Foes have quite a bit of experience in that area. (Aside from Allen's aforementioned affiliation, bassist/vocalist Liz Wittman is one half of Kiddo and drummer Brad Elliot played with Satin Peaches.) Listeners are warned from the onset, with opening track, ""Full Moon Morning"", that Born Radical is going to be an overtly ""meta"" experience. Encapsulating everything from the excitement of first playing together (""Picked a name, picked a sound/ Played some shows, the kids came out/ But remained underground when they couldn't figure us out"") to the less savory details of road life (""Our clothes smell like piss/ We're running out of strings/ Do you think we'll live like this through the winter and the spring?""), the track manages to cram a warts-and-all look at life as a struggling musician into barely two minutes of sugar rush harmonies, crashing cymbals, and insistently downstroked, fuzzed-out guitars. A few songs later, on ""Couch Surfing"", the three-piece try to prove that not all slackers are unmotivated, as Allen sings about the chasm between his ambitions and his circumstances. And while he yelps about his dream of his band getting good reviews and not having a permanent place to sleep, he's backed by Wittman's girly ""ba ba bas"" and some cutesy woodblock percussion, making Friendly Foes sound like the New Pornographers on particularly strong amphetamines. ""Wild (Once in a While)"", the final track in the triumvirate of songs that overtly addresses band life, has a comparably spare opening-- though it later blooms into a bouquet of ""ooh la la""s, bright, driving keyboards, and crashing cymbals-- that reminds listeners that at the bottom of this saturated sound lurks Elvis Costello's melodic economy. Musically, Friendly Foes sit on a precarious highwire, balancing between cheery 1970s power pop and the gloriously lo-fi ""college"" rock of the early 90s. Despite the similarities to a jittery Carl Newman and his crew, Allen's infectious, chugging guitar riffs and nasal, androgynous delivery make it hard not to hear Superchunk pretty explicitly as an influence throughout the album, though Mac McCaughan's group never sounded this rich or sunny. Adding to the 90s nostalgia is Wittman's babydoll voice, which recalls Juliana Hatfield and the slew of other Sassy female frontwomen of her era. ""Get Ripped"", the only track of the collection to feature her lead vocals, feels like a sped up version of ""My Sister"" (or better yet, something off Belly's 1993 debut). Wrapped in purposely rough production that makes it seem like the distorted guitars and muddy, trebly vocals were literally recorded in a garage, Friendly Foes seem punk, even though, at their heart, their nerdy, hyperactive anthems are no more punk than songs by the similarly named slick English dance poppers with whom they are often confused (that would be Friendly Fires). Admittedly, as Born Radical wears on, its helium-injected vocals become tiring to the ear. Ditto the record's full-throttle velocity, though there is something to be said for the enthusiasm of a group that can't help but play at maximum speed at all times. But luckily this 13-song collection only lasts 34 minutes, so listeners will barely have time to register such fatigue before the album is over and they're craving its hooky blasts of harmony all over again. After all, you'd be hard pressed to find another album this year that will give you such an accurate feeling of what's it's like to be a band (and no, being an expert at ""Guitar Hero"" doesn't count).","Ryan Allen of Thunderbirds Are Now! returns with a vigorously played song cycle about the life of a rock journeyman.

The Floodlight Collective,Lotus Plaza,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a337b1335d7bf169869c/1:1/w_160/761cb79b.jpg,2009-03-20 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12844-the-floodlight-collective/,Kranky,"It'll be a shame if Lockett Pundt's solo debut gets lost in all the light and heat coming from his main band. But it won't be surprising. In a rare interview, the shy Deerhunter-er told blog BBQCHICKENROBOT that he started recording his album at the beginning of 2007. Since then, Deerhunter has released Cryptograms, the Fluorescent Grey EP, and last year's Microcastle/Weird Era Cont.; lead singer Bradford Cox's Atlas Sound has released Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel, plus a staggering number of mp3s, mixes, and non-album tracks. At shows, Pundt can be seen strumming wordlessly, staring toward his effects pedals. And yet the sole figure behind Lotus Plaza has had a huge-- and all too often unacknowledged-- role in establishing Deerhunter's hallucinatory sound. The Atlanta band's chaotic 2005 debut, Deerhunter aka Turn It Up Faggot, gets kind of a bad rap, no doubt in part because Cox disavowed the thing. But it shows that Deerhunter didn't turn into the shoegaze-drenched dreamweavers we know and love until after Pundt joined. Pundt wrote the music for some of Deerhunter's most indelible songs-- ""Strange Lights"", ""Like New""-- and made his singing debut on Microcastle. The Atlas Sound album, which features Pundt's guitar on ""Cold as Ice"", is dedicated to him. So that the first Lotus Plaza album, The Floodlight Collective, is a hazy bedroom reverie shouldn't surprise listeners accustomed to other Deerhunter-related projects, the hypnotic solo work of Panda Bear, the lonesome longing of Jeremy Jay, or to a lesser extent the introverted homemade racket of Wavves and Dum Dum Girls. Produced by Brian Foote of Nudge, the album submerges plaintive vocals in layer after reverb-washed cloud layer of ethereal guitar atmospherics, achieving a woozy and sometimes barely intelligible prettiness. That can best be heard on tracks like the tambourine-jangling ""Whiteout""-- its gentle melody gaining force on repeat listens-- or the squealing, Quickspace-esque rocker ""What Grows?"" (it does, an abstract Yo La Tengo). Pundt plays all instruments, except for Cox's turn on Factory-ready drums for the sweet dream pop of ""Different Mirrors""; a bouncy Supremes beat gives way to outer-space Roy Orbison on ""Quicksand"". The krautrock pulse and piano-dripping radiance of seven-minute centerpiece ""Antoine"" sound like a Stereolab disciple starting to come into his own. As with bashful Blur guitarist Graham Coxon on his own solo debut more than a decade ago, Pundt at times lets his diffidence get the best of him. For all the subtle detail in a track like the mournful, pitch-shifted ""Sunday Night""-- which vaguely recalls Atlas Sound's ""Bite Marks"" in its nostalgic main riff-- with Pundt's melodic and conceptual strengths so submerged, the album can begin to run together. That's probably the point: From the washed-out cover art to the few discernible lyrics, The Floodlight Collective is obsessed with the indistinctness of memory, the dazzlement of bright lights. Opener ""Red Oak Way"", maybe Pundt's ""Hazel St."", longs for ""sunny Saturdays watching cartoons in the living room,"" warm rays shining through the windowpane. So The Floodlight Collective is a mostly elegant listen, and one whose failings are part of its theme: Like a vague recollection, it's still a little hard to hold onto after it's over-- pretty albeit somewhat ephemeral. Memory knows before knowing remembers, sure, but too much light makes the baby go blind.","Deerhunter guitarist makes his solo debut, a hazy bedroom reverie that shouldn't surprise listeners accustomed to his main band.

Fever Ray,Fever Ray,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a338c0084474cd0c020f/1:1/w_160/b40eb146.jpg,2009-03-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12845-fever-ray/,MuteRabid,"That the Knife's 2006 breakthrough Silent Shout didn't set the dominoes on a series of similarly grotesque and unnatural sounding imitators is less an indictment on its impact than a comment on its inimitability. The current apex of ten years' collaboration between siblings Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer, it's one of a handful of albums from the past decade that one might argue sounded like nothing before it. In the three years since, the Dreijers have treaded lightly, touring and remixing in carefully managed bursts before quietly receding back into silence altogether. When news of a Dreijer Andersson solo project called Fever Ray broke in October, one would have been forgiven for wondering if the duo hadn't secretly made good on their threats to call it quits. God knows, they still might. The point is, you'll get no clues here: although every bit as alluring, this debut has as much in conflict as it has in common with Silent Shout. The sounds often square, but the ferociousness has been subsumed by a slow drip of anxiety and dread. The macabre nursery rhymes have given way to lyrics that imply a sort of domestic cabin fever. It's still of the same creator, just not from the same swamp. Things move slowly here; they slither instead of stomp. The house-inflected, booming low end of Silent Shout has been scrubbed away, leaving Karin's voice naked and upfront, anchoring the songs in a way it hasn't previously been required to. Although no less inscrutable, her lyrics adjust. Where those on Silent Shout had a witchy scale and ambition appropriate to the hugeness of the songs, Fever Ray's words feel so interior as to seem slightly unhinged. Indeed, one of Fever Ray's most remarkable aspects comes from how Dreijer Andersson funnels little moments of humor, banality, remembrance, mania, and anxiety through her deadpan affect to create a central character worthy of any psychological horror. You might even reasonably suggest this record is about psychosis. ""I've got a friend who I've known since I was seven/ We used to talk on the phone/ If we have time/ If it's the right time,"" she declares conspiratorially, amidst pattering drums and faintly tropical synths in ""Seven"". In the morose, slumbering ""Concrete Walls"", she slows her voice to a pained yawn, which repeats the final couplet to a resigned fade: ""I live between concrete walls/ In my arms she was so warm/ Oh how I try/ I leave the TV on/ And the radio."" In addition to many of the same plasticky percussions and goofy synth sounds that the Knife made their stock in trade, Fever Ray also brims with fragile, more finely articulated sounds, such as the delicate mallet instruments that punctuate ""Now's The Only Time I Know"", the bamboo flute that wanders through ""Keep the Streets Empty For Me"", and the grinding guitar sound in ""I'm Not Done"". The album moves at roughly the same pace and with the same general tone, rendering some of the songs indistinguishable at first, but committed listens will reveal this to be as nuanced and as rich of a production as anything either Dreijer has done. The highlights are many. Opener ""If I Had a Heart"" is a shivering, timely meditation on greed, immorality, and lust for power that dovetails nicely with AIG and Madoff (""This will never end cause I want more/ More, give me more, give me more""); ""I'm Not Done"" is a pressurized squall that culminates with Karin dueting with a helium-voiced version of herself; while seven-minute closer ""Coconut"" rumbles on a pattern of synths and staccato drums before a ceremonious wall of voices arrive at the midpoint to march it to a close. Except, ""close"" implies it was written: the more time you spend with Fever Ray, the more you become convinced that these songs aren't written so much as they're temporarily let out. They're too starved, too eerie, and too transfigured to have been anything but.","Three years after the landmark Silent Shout, the Knife's Karin Dreijer Andersson returns as Fever Ray.

White Light Strobing,Desolation Wilderness,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc2abf31b7dc7156006/1:1/w_160/d6613380.jpeg,2009-03-19 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12775-white-light-strobing/,K,"Some records punch you in the face, and others don't dare even whisper in your ear. Then there are the ones like White Light Strobing, the full-length debut of the recently upsized Olympia, Wash., trio Desolation Wilderness. Records like that just hang in the air. If you're fond of word-shy, languid rock in the style of, say, Galaxie 500, you know the kind of record I mean: they're long on atmosphere, and the really good ones making themselves known only after you find yourself a spot amongst the beds of spindly guitars and hushed drums. If you're fond of such records, it won't take you long to get acquainted with White Light Strobing. To paint White Light Strobing as This Is More of Our Music is, of course, reductive. But it's all there, from Nicolas Zwart's unhurried, unaffected vocals to the gentle gyrations of the guitars down to the record's lovely live-in-a-room sound. If Zwart took his vowels down under a bit, his high, clear (but not exactly strong) voice could pass for Dean Wareham's, too. Instrumentally, Desolation Wilderness are almost certainly more accomplished; not a great feat considering the amateurish glee at the heart of so much great Galaxie music, but a point in their column nevertheless. Lyrically, however, it's no contest. Whereas Wareham's moony non-sequiturs helped hang even a lackluster melody among the stars, Zwart's not saying much of anything worth mentioning throughout White Light Strobing. What we're left with is a whole lot of atmosphere-- which will be all too familiar to most folks who find this record-- in search of better songs. It'd help some if there were more to say about the vocal tracks. Limber though they are on record, Zwart seems to treat his instrumentals with the utmost care: The gently cascading ""Road Song"" is just pure gorgeousness on wax, and if they play their cards right, it'll soundtrack one hell of a Gap commercial someday. You can practically hear the frost growing on the glistening ""Paris to New York"", and ""Turquoise and Gold"" flits around like Chet Atkins playing with Codeine. For the most part, however, the tracks on which Zwart gets a word or two in on don't have the weight to support even the flimsiest of vocal melodies. There are quite a few songs about cars and girls, but nothing that reads more like poetry than a placeholder, and hardly a song with vocals that wouldn't have sounded better with another guitar or something instead. And the songs never sink in, they sound just as willowy and pleasant on first listen as they do on the 20th, and they pass through your ears in much the same manner. It doesn't help that Zwart, a singer in the ""Well, guess somebody's gotta do it"" school, mumbles his way through half these tunes, often rendering his voice the least interesting element in the mix. With all that said, it's still easy enough to see an instrumentally assured, atmospherically gifted Desolation Wilderness stepping back from the reverberations on their forebears and cranking out a gem. It's gonna take better songs than these to match the sumptuous swirl they've got down pat here on White Light Strobing, however, and whether that means Zwart spends more or less time pushing the pen around the lyric page, this is a band with greater strengths than they're playing to on White Light Strobing, and one that'd do well to hang some of their glorious noise on something more worthy of it. All those reverberations gotta start from somewhere, after all.","Pacific NW band crafts word-shy, languid dream-pop in the style of Galaxie 500, heavy on atmosphere and gently cascading guitars.

Fabric 45,Omar S,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31fb1335d7bf169865f/1:1/w_160/536a01fc.jpg,2009-03-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12824-fabric-45/,Fabric,"For a world still actively exploring its own boundaries, techno is history obsessed and ferociously insular. So when relatively unknown Detroit producer Omar S told the dance-music site Resident Advisor, ""I don't even know who Ricardo Willalobo is""-- backhanding Ricardo Villalobos, techno's frustrating, progressive king-- pundits rushed to their keyboards, birthing messageboard threads that reached 10 pages in length but rarely moved past a collective oh no he didn't. On the one hand, Omar S knows how to handle press-- curse, a lot (nine instances of ""fuck"" in under 150 words!); show more interest in illegal auto racing than the genre you perform in; claim to not buy music; claim, even, not to really like it. On the other hand, the prospect that he really is a know-nothing-- or, at least, that he doesn't care about his environment-- is magnetic. In a scene that often seems to feed off itself, it's hard not to wonder what Omar S is eating. So London club and label Fabric asks him to make his own mix, and he turns in 80 minutes of his own tracks, some dating back to 2004. (""I don't need other people's music; I got over 100 songs released."") Whether that's heresy or not, I don't care. Most of this stuff was only on vinyl until now, and it's just as easy-- and as rewarding-- for me to think of this disc as a compilation of his productions as a DJ mix. His music isn't unlike his public persona-- brash, bitter, soulful, and vaguely threatening. The tracks collected on Fabric 45 aren't funky, but they have a zombie-like imperative to them. They're not melodically complex, either, and when he builds a half-memorable tune-- ""Oasis 13 ½"" or ""Psychotic Photosynthesis"", both which resemble Kraftwerk, a little-- he straps it to the bassline in a way that suggests he thinks melody is frivolous. They're built on blocky, simple sounds, but structured with subtlety and control. For someone who flaunts as much confidence and ego as Omar S does, his music is almost impetuously basic at times-- he's like a woodsman who builds a lean-to in your living room when you already set up the air mattress. It's not conservative, it's gutter, it's flamboyant. The occasional vocalists-- on ""U"" or ""The Maker""-- sound lonely and disoriented, like deep-house divas who collapsed in alleyways before ambling home in the last few minutes before dawn. Video-game samples pollute 19th century church organ (""Strider's World""); and brutish, deadlocked four-four gets syncopated with noise (""Simple Than Sorry""). Zealots say the crown is ""Psychotic Photosynthesis"", a dizzy, slow-bubbling track whose melody peels out of its bassline so carefully that it's hard to notice until it's fully arrived-- it definitely stands out, but doesn't overshadow. While it's tempting to draw Omar S into the long narrative of Detroit techno, he doesn't fit the mold: Detroit, as I always heard it, represented a banging but sophisticated futurism; Omar S, by comparison, is definitively unrefined. The cover of his one full-length album, 2005's Just Ask the Lonely, is a sloppily altered photo of him playing an arcade console whose display shows a picture of what are presumably his kids. He claims to sign his white labels with the same marker he uses working a day job at Ford. Just Ask the Lonely takes its name from a Four Tops song-- another Detroit institution, Motown. ""Day"", on the Fabric mix, samples the Supremes' ""Come See About Me"", briefly. Omar S' music doesn't have any of the charm of Motown-- it's unfriendly, nocturnal stuff. But in a way, Motown's an even better touchstone than Detroit techno: Music made with efficiency and confidence; music that didn't have to be too aware of what was going on around it because it was busy trying to make a little world of its own.","Fabric's latest was created by an up-and-coming Detroit techno producer, but not one genuflecting before his city's rich dance history.

I've picked up a few of these in flea markets, used record shops, and online, and I've frequently been surprised at how great some of them are. I guess if you spend every night playing the same songs, putting together a pretty great album of those songs is a cakewalk. The musical life of the Caribbean has long been one of cross-currents and mixed identities. The black, slave-descended populations of the islands have towering musical histories, often in spite of European attempts to squash those histories, while the legacy of colonialism and the reality of tourist-driven economies adds European and American influences-- to say nothing of what the hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese immigrants brought to the region after slavery's abolition brought with them (some of Folkways' LPs of Jamaican traditional music include Hindustani dance music). Calypsoul 70 reflects that melting pot through the lens of the funky 70s with an inspired and wide-ranging selection of tracks from Cuba, Trinidad & Tobago, Bahamas, Martinique, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Jamaica, Dominica, Antigua, and mainland Guyana that range from Carnival rave-ups to disco, reggae, gospel, hard funk, and soul jazz with garage rock organ on top. The use of the word Calypsoul as an umbrella term is more clever than historical, and it could be argued that the disc's broad focus means it fails to tell much of a story about this music, but it could be argued more strongly that such a body-moving mixture needs no larger intellectual justification-- there's a lot to be said for shutting up and getting down. Getting down is no big challenge when confronted with the riff-heavy proto-disco of the Revolution of St. Vincent's ""The Little You Say"", one of a handful of dancefloor burners that are the stock-in-trade of compilations like this. Where the disc gets more interesting is when it heads a little further off the beaten track into distinctly Caribbean recordings. Clarence Curvan & His Mod Sounds turn in a swinging Carnival instrumental with the compilation's title track, mixing trap drums and hand percussion with a crashing, celebratory horn section and even a twangy guitar solo, while the Hondells' ""Raycan"" travels similar ground. It's uplifting, insanely fun music that sounds all the better for its relatively ragged production values. You can hear the horns in a room, all gathered around one microphone and just blowing. Politics were never far from the mic in calypso music, and there are some brilliant examples of that at work here, from Tyrone Taylor's roots reggae ""Move Up Blackman"" to Biosis Now's raucous funk celebration of independence, ""Independent Bahamas"". Duke (known earlier in his career as Mighty Duke) is openly confrontational on ""Freedom in Africa"", offering that if dialogue doesn't produce results, war is certainly an option. The best of the political offerings, though, is Lancelot Layne's stunning ""Yo Tink It Sorf?"" The Trinidadian singer's style is sometimes called rapso, which makes total sense-- his sing-speak cadence on this song prefigures both dancehall toasting and rapping. The song's musical backing is little more than an army of hand drums and some flute, while Layne rips into Trinidadian youth's idolization of American ghetto life, sometimes oddly harmonized in his raps by his backing musicians. ""How you going to feel to see a child suffer permanent brain damage from lead poisoning/ Who you go blame when they end up in the hands of some lawless lawman?"" It's a breathtaking track and a revelation for calypso fans who don't know his work. The other musically radical track is Martiniquan pianist Marius Cultier's wicked, rocket-propelled tribal jazz workout ""Guanavaco"", which opens with a call-and-response chant over wild hand drumming before settling into a strong piano-funk groove. Even tracks that scream novelty up front, like Amral's Trinidad Cavaliers Steel Orchestra's steel drum cover of Gwen McCrae's ""90% of Me Is You"" turn out to be great. For a lot of Americans and Europeans, the Caribbean is an entire region reduced to a couple tri-fold brochures and a taxi ride straight from the airport to the resort hotel. This collection doesn't change its image as a sunny, friendly place, but it does reveal deeper aspects of its melting pot culture and complex politics. It's a superb first step into the region for beginners as well.","Calypsoul 70 reflects the incredible melting pot of the Caribbean by collecting tracks recorded in the funky 70s from throughout the region.

Take My Breath Away,Gui Boratto,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a336b1335d7bf1698696/1:1/w_160/781ffa7a.jpg,2009-03-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12843-take-my-breath-away/,Kompakt,"Gui Boratto is as much a product of the democratization of techno as he is a preacher of it. While he started out in the early 1990s as a jingle writer in São Paulo before moving to rock production and performing, his subsequent move to techno was motivated primarily by the desire for control: He wanted to be able to run his own studio from his living room. And control he did: Chromophobia, his 2007 breakthrough on Kompakt, evangelized the steady bass pulse and austere dissonance of contemporary techno within the context of inviting, discrete songs. In 2007 Boratto and Axel Willner, aka the Field, mixed a powerful serum of pop-aware techno. They posited consumer-friendly full-length albums that appealed to rock listeners skeptical about dance music's extreme repetition and track-driven culture. Take My Breath Away, the follow-up, folds the cold abstractions of techno into the lyrical sheen of synth-pop. You can take the album's title any way you like-- a reference to the Top Gun Berlin jam, a mawkish platitude, or a winking jab at both. In any case, the record is quite different thematically from Chromophobia. The latter was an elemental evocation both aesthetic (reflecting Boratto's desire to expand his expressive palette) and political (""Chromophobia"" being a veiled reference to the racial and sexual tensions of the style). Cover art comparisons rarely do their subjects justice, but here it suffices: Boratto approached Chromophobia as an abstraction of design; Take My Breath Away is a living, breathing portrait painted in simple (maybe even simplistic) terms. For better or for worse, Take My Breath Away feels comfortable and content. Boratto battered Chromophobia opener ""Scene 1"" with skittering rhythms and gong-like bass revelations, pushing the mix so far in the red it almost knocked the track off its rhythmic foundation. ""Take My Breath Away"" purrs in comparison, winding up tension not via rhythmic interplay, but by the fact that he's actually playing it straight. Single ""Atomic Soda"" offers the same sort of view from 10,000 feet, playing like a streamlined mix of Chromophobia's ""The Blessing"" before burning into and re-constituting itself via glitchy beats in the breakdown. The lead synth lines on ""Colors"" and ""Azurra"" could have been cribbed off a ""Legend of Zelda"" game, but Boratto contextualizes them within a sentimentalized backdrop and sells them convincingly: they are discrete little packets of schmaltz. Fittingly, ""No Turning Back"", this record's standout track, reaches for the same heights of pop idolatry as Chromophobia's ""Beautiful Life"". Slower and kissed with cymbals from his drum machine's ""Rock"" kit, ""No Turning Back"" delivers on Boratto's unstated notion that techno's best grooves are really just rock riffs extended over longer time periods. Vocalist Luciana Villanova (Boratto's wife) also sang on ""Beautiful Life"", and her simple and divine verses again arrive pregnant with empty meaning. Yes, Boratto's loudest denial of techno strictures, smack dab in the middle of an album full of such denials, arrives in the form of a house music diva verse. The words themselves are so dull, they verge on parody; her voice is detached but holds dear to the song's platitudes as the siren-wail of guitars surrounds her, sublimely unexpected. It's one of the best songs of the year so far, but it may have delivered the final stroke in painting Boratto into his own corner of semi-serious banality. No turning back, indeed. Boratto once told Stylus Magazine of ""Beautiful Life"": ""There's that bassline at the end of the track-- well, I made a little joke. I was pretending to be like [New Order's] Peter Hook. It was just a little joke."" I never really believed that New Order jab was really a joke. Boratto's fluency with the pop music idiom informs his eloquence within the hard jargon of techno. But what really makes his work special is his ability to speak two musical languages at once without sounding like he's pandering to either side. His deliberate inflections of melody often emerge with a ring of truth, especially as he guides his repetitions through the peaks and valleys of his little mostly-nonverbal anecdotes. One gets the sense, however, that in acknowledging where his inspirations came from and figuring out where his compositions will go on Take My Breath Away, he's misplaced the present tense and the once-present tension.","Brazilian producer's follow-up to 2007's excellent Chromophobia is another fusion of rock dynamics, synth-pop textures, and techno propulsion.

Enemy Mine,Swan Lake,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a331b1335d7bf1698689/1:1/w_160/02c88a0f.jpg,2009-03-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12839-enemy-mine/,Jagjaguwar,"Easy math even I can do: two gigantic heads are better than one, three certainly better than two, and so on and so forth. But when you're talking about records by supergroups, that logic doesn't always hold. Projects run the risk of being trampled by big feet and bigger egos. Avoiding these pitfalls is Swan Lake, that three-headed dragon comprised of left-field Canadian indie rockers Dan Bejar (of Destroyer and the New Pornographers), Spencer Krug (Wolf Parade, Frog Eyes, and Sunset Rubdown) and Carey Mercer (Frog Eyes, Blackout Beach). As vocalists, they range from downcast warble to abrasive yelp; as writers, they're known for cryptic, densely allusive songs that twist and slither into unexpected places. The phrase ""acquired taste"" comes to mind. But their 2006 debut Beast Moans was muscular and melodic and dizzying in all the right places; when the three crashed into each other on tape it made for a satisfying ""Kablaam!"" that reflected the weight of their pedigree and differing gifts. But then again, for better or worse, that first record only hinted at the fireworks a less manic or dense collaboration might yield. Enemy Mine finds the group in such a wide-open brainspace-- breathing easy and totally in step. Containing just nine songs, each songwriter enjoys three distinct showcases. And while Bejar's tics tended to dominate on Beast Moans, this time it feels more inclusive-- you can hear them coaxing the best out of one another, fortifying the spaces that separate them. Opener ""Spanish Gold, 2044"" arrives on a platter of serrated guitar and moans, all of which can be traced to Mercer. And as strong a first step as it is, the track doesn't take off until Krug and Bejar join in with wails and instrumentation of their own. Then there's ""Paper Lace"", a Krug-fronted pop embrace with a feathery hook that Mercer and Bejar amplify but never overwhelm. And Bejar? He finishes up the opening blast with ""Heartswarm"", a ballad that stands tall on album full of them. It's not the nutty poetry or ""Duke of Earl""-like chord changes that gives the song its shine, but rather the warmth of the textures they've bundled it up in. As relatively bare bones as some of these arrangements are, the songs are as kinetic as one might hope for from such dynamic songwriters. They just wouldnt sound as rich had they been fleshed out by any other set of players. Still, the album's middle stretch sags quite a bit in comparison. Bejar's self-references, Krug disappears into the tangles of his own keyboard work, and Mercer, despite emerging here as a not-so-secret weapon, collapses from the weight of his inhalations and spasms. But even this lull is a useful reminder. Because as triumphant as the closing seconds of ""Spider"" and ""Warlock Psychologist"" are (and they really are), it's important to remember that Swan Lake's appeal can be found in the way their creative personalities merge. More unites these dudes than just a tireless work ethic, Bowie fetish, and hair-raising vocal delivery. All have made names for themselves by crafting fractured pop music, for framing the off-center beautifully. It's not only remarkable that they found each other, but that they're able to make so much room for one another as well.","Second album from the indie rock supergroup comprised of Dan Bejar, Spencer Krug, and Carey Mercer is more balanced and inclusive than its predecessor.

The Wolf Also Shall Dwell With the Lamb,Brethren of the Free Spirit,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32113d1975652138a08/1:1/w_160/20d6e1da.jpg,2009-03-18 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12825-the-wolf-also-shall-dwell-with-the-lamb/,Important,"James Blackshaw and Jozef van Wissem are logical collaborators. Blackshaw, a British guitarist descended from the modern primitive tradition of John Fahey and Robbie Basho, and van Wissem, a lute player and minimalist composer from Maastricht, both produce searching but accessible music that lends itself to meditative states. It should come as no surprise, then, that the music they make together traverses similar terrain. The tension between texture and melody in Blackshaw's music and van Wissem's love of palindromic melodies and spare composition are each well in evidence on these four joint compositions-- it's a pairing of rare sympathy, but it also feels somewhat more slight than the work of either man on his own. Perhaps it's the brevity of the album-- half an hour-- or the fact that the first seven minutes is nothing but a wandering exploration of guitar harmonics and the wolf tones of the lute, but any chance for true immersion the album affords is lamentably fleeting. That's not to be taken as a write-off. At its best, this music is vibrant, deriving amazing amounts of energy from simple interplay of repeated figures. Blackshaw plays a 12-string guitar tuned to DADEAD on the whole album, and van Wissem counters with a specially-built 13-course Baroque lute. The tones of the instruments blend well, allowing the listener to concentrate on the slow mutation of patterns and the strange symmetry of the musical figures. The two middle pieces are the best of the four, with the title track beautifully building a collection of tiny melodic fragments into a gentle flowing, lighter-than-air bed of sound that almost resembles a harpsichord caprice. Its nearly nine minutes pass by in a flash as the figures come and go in steady waves. ""Into the Dust of the Earth"" is a little more involved, harmonically, revolving around ancient-sounding, cycling melodies. The rhythm is accented with hard, buzzing plucks of the strings, and 12-string guitar has an interesting, almost chorused sound in the lower registers. The album's longest piece, ""I Am a Flower of Sharon and a Rose in the Valley,"" closes things out on an intentionally unresolved note, ending its spare, fragmented run by leaving a few notes just hanging in the air-- it's a neat piece from moment to moment (especially when van Wissem breaks out the bottleneck slide in the mid-section), but it lacks the flow from tension to release and back that characterize the best tracks on the record. Those who are devoted to the new wave of acoustic experimentalism Blackshaw and van Wissem are helping to lead will undoubtedly find much to enjoy here, but for more casual listeners it lacks the power and emotional pull of either man's work.","James Blackshaw, today's foremost guitarist in the modern primitive tradition, teams with lutist Jozef van Wissem.

L'Entredeux,Marianne Dissard,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2be9d034d5c69bf2c83/1:1/w_160/7b10d443.jpeg,2009-03-18 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12748-lentredeux/,self-released,"Marianne Dissard's songs are about falling apart and coming together, but not necessarily in that order. Her second album, L'Entredeux, was reportedly written during the break-up of her marriage to fellow Tucson musician Naïm Amor and certainly deals with desires relieved and thwarted, commitments betrayed, relationships redefined. That Dissard sings in French only makes her subject matter seem more precarious and interiorized, as if she is keeping listeners at a safe distance even as her low, smoky chanteuse vocals draw them closer. Born in France but based in Arizona, the singer-songwriter-filmmaker writes as if she must constantly take stock of a relationship, sorting through memories both good and bad. She thanks him for ""hot tea and a weather report"" on ""Merci de Rien du Tout"", then adds ""thanks for nothing."" On ""Les Confettis"" she toasts ""to my handkerchiefs, to your laziness... all our hopes in pieces by night"" in a one-woman ticker-tape parade for dashed dreams. Finally, ""Indiana Song"" delivers harsh closure: ""It's over,"" she sings, her voice quavering only slightly. ""We won't save our skins no more."" L'Entredeux may be Dissard's Rumors or Shoot Out the Lights , but the album sounds idiosyncratic: a coming-together of European musical traditions and American sounds. This is chanson adapted to the American southwest; of course Joey Burns produced the album. Dissard may be best known for dueting with him on ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"", from the Calexico's Hot Rail, and he returns the favor by giving L'Entredeux an arid luster, full of soundtrack strings, curious accordion, and John Convertino's rumbling, shuffling drums (few drummers have a sound as immediately recognizable as Convertino). Long-time Willie Nelson cohort Mickey Raphael lends high-desert harmonica to ""Sans-Façon"", and Amor himself even adds snappy guitar licks to ""L'Embellie"" and """"Ce Visage-Là"". Burns' Wurlitzer turns ""Les Confettis"" into a dark carnival, then ends ""Merci de Rien du Tout"" with a lengthy sound collage outro pasted together with pieces of a sampled French lesson. At its best, L'Entredeux sounds lively and expansive, an idiosyncratic view of French and southwestern musics; at other times it sounds a bit too much like Calexico. But generally Burns keeps the arrangements textured enough to be interesting but not intrusive: a mere backdrop to reinforce Dissard's endeavors of intimacy. With the crisp phrasing of Françoise Hardy and the bluesy tone of Chan Marshall, Dissard holds the album together bravely. Unless you undestand French, you may not apprehend the narrative specifics of the garage-rocking ""Trop Expres"" or the slow-burning ""Cayenne"", but she easily and naturally communicates each song's strange mix of strong desires and overwhelming regrets.","French-born, Arizona-based, this singer-filmmaker keeps listeners at a safe distance even as her low, smoky chanteuse vocals draw them closer.

Flood Bank,The Lines,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3039d034d5c69bf2d17/1:1/w_160/f3a9a9c7.jpg,2009-03-18 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12804-flood-bank/,Acute,"Between the years of 1976 and 1986 alone, approximately 5,943 punk/indie/new wave bands formed and folded, never to be heard from again (trust us, we counted). That was just in the UK and, needless to say, mostly for the better. Many of those acts weren't even memorable enough to be forgotten. Of course, that hasn't stopped a cottage industry of reissue imprints from treating every lost album like a classic, but every so often, the stream of overlooked acts given second chances turns up something pretty great. Case in point: the Lines. Falling somewhere between the minimalist funk of A Certain Ratio, the angular Spartan punk of Wire or early Cure, and the atmospheric art rock of fellow coulda-beens the Sound, the Lines existed between 1978 and 1983, releasing five singles, one EP, and two LPs. The group apparently never toured and, more obviously, never took off, disappearing off the grid to all but the most avid collectors. But when those singles and EPs were compiled last year as Memory Span, many wondered how a group like the Lines could escape notice for so long, especially considering the band's linear post-punk owed much to the evergreen (and everhip) Factory Records aesthetic (even if, like a lot of the Factory stable, the music boasted more potential than payoff). Still, the group had something, and finally, with the release of Memory Span, new fans had something as well. And now with Flood Bank, they have something more. Specifically, the set rounds up the group's two LPs, Therapy and Ultramarine, resequenced for impact rather than chronologically, offering a fresh way to approach the Lines' admittedly limited output, whether you caught them the first time around or (more likely) didn't. There are some great tracks here, most of which have escaped the post-punk reissue craze. ""Stripe"" is half-speed funk, all groove and menace, while ""Airlift""'s combo of canned and live percussion, spare guitar, and rubbery bass leads to an unexpectedly melodic chorus. The sentimental ""Blow a Kiss"" comes off almost as a UK take on Buddy Holly's pop primitivism, and if the hectic ""Have a Heart"" is more recognizably proto-new wave, it's sparse enough to have escaped many of the era's gaudy trappings. The ballad ""No Hiding"" doesn't sound quite fully formed, yet the slow jam ""Ultramarine"" could have been a college radio hit, given more spit and polish. Lines leader Rico Conning (now a noted engineer) hailed from Macclesfield, also home to Ian Curtis, and you can often hear glimmers of Joy Division, too, in the tribal percussion and studio experiments. (Conning himself claims allegiance to Krautrock and Television, among others.) But the more time you spend with the Lines, the more individual character the music exudes. This isn't the sound of train-jumping followers but contemporaneous leaders-- leaders no doubt shocked that few were lining up behind them. So belated or not, let the queue start here.","The EPs and singles by this sadly unheralded post-punk group finally saw the light of day on Memory Span; here their LPs are collected as well.

Quiet Please...The New Best of Nick Lowe,Nick Lowe,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3059d034d5c69bf2d19/1:1/w_160/385b53ed.jpg,2009-03-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12805-quiet-pleasethe-new-best-of-nick-lowe/,Yep Roc,"Quiet Please...The New Best of Nick Lowe doesn't beat around the bush. It's direct not just in name (both reflecting Lowe's current stylistic bent and logically supplanting 1989's Basher: The Best of Nick Lowe) but also because it begins with what may literally be the very best of Nick Lowe: the increasingly canonical ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"". That song could have appeared on this set in any of several different forms, each equally important to Lowe's career, albeit for different reasons. There's of course the popular and most recognizable version by Lowe's friend Elvis Costello. There's also the less familiar version by Curtis Stigers, found on the soundtrack to The Bodyguard, whose massive sales earned Lowe enough cash to subsidize his 90s  resurgence. Then there's the stripped-down version Lowe typically plays live these days, indicative of the hushed turn his career has taken in its fourth decade. The version that begins the new 2xCD best-of set, however, is by the marginal pub-rock band Brinsley Schwarz, the early outfit that gave Lowe his start. The Brinsley Schwarz cut dates back to 1974, well before Lowe hitched his wagon to the nascent Stiff imprint, produced vital singles by the Damned and Pretenders (among others), struck out on his own with a brilliant debut, Jesus of Cool, rode a solo career through many ups and downs (both musical and personal), and eventually even married into the Johnny Cash clan (Lowe's ""The Beast in Me"" would also become a highpoint of Cash's own contemporaneous comeback, American Recordings). Which leads us to where Lowe is today, a place far removed from his sly roots-rocker persona and more inclined toward post-war proto-rock and subdued soul. If there's one favor this new best-of does, it's reminding us that this other side of Lowe was in fact there all along. ""Endless Sleep"", from 1977's cleverly titled Bowi EP (released in response to Bowie's Low) wouldn't be out of place on any of Lowe's recent records, and the same could be said for 1979's ""You Make Me"", 1982's ""Raining Raining"", or 1990's ""What's Shakin' on the Hill"". On the other hand, Quiet Please is the product of artist prerogative. Its tracklisting was handpicked by Lowe, and with the benefit of hindsight the artist has deemed a few songs from his previous best-of unworthy of inclusion here. If the effect isn't quite the rush of Basher, Quiet Please does offer a more fully-formed portrait of the artist as a young man, old man, and all places in between, tossing in among the obvious ""Cruel to Be Kind"", ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"", ""Without Love"", ""I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock and Roll)"", and a handful of tracks from Lowe-related projects such as Rockpile and Little Village before moving on to more recent material. Lowe has claimed that his current reinvention as a classy and classic crooner stems from toting his acoustic guitar out into the countryside and playing anonymous music halls until his own compositions approached the somewhat obscure numbers he'd long admired. You can sure hear that in songs like ""You Inspire Me"", ""Lonesome Reverie"", ""Faithless Lover"", ""Lately I've Let Things Slide"", and the wry ""Has She Got a Friend"" (essentially a gender-swapped rewrite of Richard Thompson's ""Has He Got a Friend for Me"", and the lonely companion to Lowe's blithely misogynist ""I Trained Her to Love Me""). Admittedly, not everyone has taken to Lowe's quiet side, and compared to his early work it's easy to confuse his weariness for snooziness. But that early work's still there-- and here-- for the listening. What Quiet Please does, then, is offer a clearer trail of breadcrumbs leading anyone familiar with Lowe only at his most witty and high-energy to his current role as punk jester in repose.","Not to be confused with the 1989 best-of Basher, this new comp presents a fuller view of the diverse singer-songwriter's career.

Bromst,Dan Deacon,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32ac0084474cd0c01f0/1:1/w_160/c87276fb.jpg,2009-03-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12833-bromst/,Carpark,"Midway through 2007, someone asked me the usual question-- the one about which records I'd want to take with me to a desert island. The first answer that sprang to mind seemed somehow perverse: Dan Deacon's Spiderman of the Rings? I certainly didn't think this was one of the best, most profound, or most life-sustaining records I'd ever heard, and it wasn't as if I had some great personal attachment to it; I'd only first heard the thing that spring. But it seemed like a lifetime on a desert island would get awfully lonely, and there was something about the album that seemed like a solution to that problem. All the happy massed shouting on a song like ""Wham City""! There's plenty of music in the world that conjures up the feeling of crowds, but so much of it feels mob-like and jack-booted, or else it's just hero-worship of whoever's posing on the stage in front. Here, on Spiderman, was at least one song where the crowd felt joyous and inviting, like people celebrating the fact of sharing something. Which seemed about as essential, desert-island-wise, as a good sharp knife. The press material for Deacon's follow-up, Bromst, talks about the notion of community, and the odd knack Deacon has for evoking it, but I'm not so sure that's entirely the point anymore. Sure, Deacon's method and sound remain mostly the same here; if you feel like you recognize the chord progressions from Spiderman, there's every chance you're right. The guy trades, after all, in movements that feel simple: He creates a dense rush of sound and then guides it through changes as broad as mountains, these shifts that slide together like blocks and burrow straight into some basic pleasure center deep in the gut of the western scale. What's different, on Bromst, is the texture and size of it all. Deacon does what most acts do to follow up a small hit: The palette is richer, the samples smoother, the space larger, the programming slightly less buzzy. Actual instruments, the kinds with microphones next to them, abound-- live drums, layers and layers of mallet instruments, a player piano that goes fluttering up and down the scale like it's stuck in the lobby of an avant-garde department store. As for community? Deacon's still fond of massed shouting, and the overlapping exhortations of electronically processed cartoon vocals-- and all the pounding of toms and ecstatic chanting can leave much of Bromst feeling like the pagan rituals of some woodland filled with chubby, bespectacled Deacon-gnomes. But those small changes manage, strangely enough, to change everything-- including the question of the happy crowd. Spiderman felt grainy, cheap, and primary-colored, an overload of cartoon buzz and bodies dancing. The denser, more sedate sound of Bromst shoots off in the opposite direction; it makes Deacon's music feel almost solipsistic, like it's ceased to come out of speakers and now lives deep inside your brain. If Spiderman was for dancing on sticky floors, Bromst feels better suited to sleeping, or contemplating the sublime, or anything else that happens mostly between your ears. As it closes, with the gorgeous ""Get Older""-- building from malfunctioning-modem synths into dreamy sheets of buzz on an achy major-seventh chord-- it actually begins to resemble the heavy, romantic sound of acts like M83, or Pluxus, or shoegazer bands, or the 8-bit ""chiptune"" programmers Deacon shares some kinship with. These are people who make music for getting lost inside your own head. What makes this change worthwhile is the complexity of Deacon's project. Most of us could have been forgiven, after a cursory listen to Spiderman, for not noticing that Deacon was conservatory-trained. But as Bromst rushes steadily by, mostly avoiding the big crowd-pleasing breakdowns and exclamations of its predecessor, the clearer production lets you sink into the minutae of it-- say, the Steve Reich-style rhythms of different mallet or drum patterns overlapping one another. The music becomes something like a natural process: one clean, simple sweep, but built from an insane complexity of detail. And there's enough to un-knot in there to make this a terrific step for Deacon-- out from the sticky basements into a space where he can try to tackle the sublime.","After breakthough Spiderman of the Rings, Dan Deacon returns with another great record whose palette is richer, the samples smoother, the space larger.

All Aboard Future,These Are Powers,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fc9d034d5c69bf2d03/1:1/w_160/a1f2deb3.jpeg,2009-03-17 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12798-all-aboard-future/,Dead Oceans,"As far as tone is concerned, These Are Powers have that down above anything else. Teeth-grittingly tense and with chilling atmosphere, they play the appropriate soundtrack for a bombed-out, water-damaged Brooklyn basement with one bulb for light. If the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had pursued the more confrontational branches of New York no-wave, they would probably sound like this. Since drafting Bill Salas on drums, electronic percussion, and weird noises in 2007, they've been adding 8-bit bells and whistles and a touch of 1990s Warp sound palette to the band's art-rock. Meanwhile, Pat Noecker continues to use his guitar to gnash and threaten around the edges of the songs, never being much of a riff guy from Liars to n0 things to now. Singer Anna Barie babbles, barks, and purrs over the peculiar pastiche. When it all comes together, it makes for something singular, and there are three great examples at the top of their latest, All Aboard Future. Opener ""Easy Answers"" starts with a galloping glam bounce of a beat-- somewhere on the same line as Battles' ""Atlas""-- that makes sampled handclaps and firecrackers indistinguishable from one another. Noecker's guitar and blurts of keyboard sound like ducks honking in a military march, while Barie veers between a mocking mutter and possessed wail. ""Life of Birds"" continues with the evil carnival vibe, with especially high and grating guitar bends and more of a spotlight on Barie, purring come-hither nonsense in between screams over a bubbly electronic two-step. ""Double Double Yolk"" has a thick, slow beat and startling ascending and descending electric tones; Barie sings more than screeches, while there's little to no guitar at all. You can pretty easily guess at the contributions of each member here, but you can just as easily see them working together and pulling back or stepping forward to lift the track higher. From there, the record withholds the release on all of its tension. ""Parallel Shores"" resolves itself instead with melodic guitar work; ""Light After Sound"" is largely static and nearly aimless, whispering the same phrase repeatedly over an ominous mechanical hum, until the band kicks in without ever breaking the mood. It seems like the kind of experiment in tension that These Are Powers might have grown out of, given the progress from release to release and their promising Taro Tarot EP from 2008. ""Adam's Turtle"" and ""Glass Blocks"" are more spooky, if familiar, skronk with unusual percussion, from steel drums to handclaps to water drops. But the parts seem more incongruous here, the slow, menacing beats of both being the only constant. There's not a lot of middle ground between no-wave and laptop workouts or modern R&B, but TAP are committed to finding it while steadfastly adhering to the creepy mood of their self-described ""ghost-punk."" This brief album is carefully sequenced, and even the most static of their songs has added texture and direction, sounding more purposefully tense. Their catchier material that front-loads the record is so distinct and stunning, however, that it's hard not to be left wanting more after those opening tracks.","If the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had pursued the more confrontational branches of New York no-wave, they would probably sound like this.

Beasts of Seasons,Laura Gibson,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3135e6ef9596932057a/1:1/w_160/40c649f9.jpg,2009-03-17 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12816-beasts-of-seasons/,Hush,"The Pacific Northwest coughs up folksy, understated singer-songwriters by the coffeehouseful, which puts Portland-based Laura Gibson at risk of getting lost in the crowd. That would be a shame: Gibson has more to offer than vague descriptors like ""folksy"" and ""understated"" would suggest, and besides, her music is far better suited to a fireplace and a cup of warm apple cider than to your local Starbucks. Raised in a tiny coastal town, the soft-spoken songstress inched quietly into the scene in 2006 with If You Come to Greet Me, her refreshingly homespun if sometimes staid full-length debut. At first blush, the follow-up, Beasts of Seasons, doesn't appear to mark a significant departure from its predecessor. But unravel its seemingly rudimentary façade and you'll find an affecting study in contrasts from a songwriter a good deal more sophisticated than she's generally willing to let on. At the core of this study is a thematic concept of Gibson's own design. She's divided the record roughly in half; ""Communion Songs"" comprise the first part, while the second is made up of ""Funeral Songs"". Yet the two ideas are hardly mutually exclusive, a notion Gibson makes evident in the opening song, seven and a half minutes of gently cascading majesty entitled ""Shadows on Parade"". Apart from evoking the passage of time, the song's central image-- ""I will watch the shadows on parade""-- suggests the solitude, repose, and even isolation of the lonely and the waiting. With Gibson's ""parade"" description, however, the solitary activity of shadow-watching becomes something contrastingly communal and celebratory, a point underscored by the sample of a distant drum corps and crowd she and producer Tucker Martine (the Decemberists, Sufjan Stevens, Mudhoney) use to close out the song. It's the first of many little moments on the record that illustrate Gibson's willingness to see an image through at a time when a lot of similar songwriters are content to settle for what ""feels good"" or ""sounds good"" and move along. Shadow-watching gives way to other pensive activities as Beasts continues: reminiscence, daydreams, diary-like appeals to an unnamed ""other"", and the meditations on mortality that mark the ""Funeral"" half of the record. ""If these bare walls could sing,"" Gibson begins on the transitional track ""Funeral Songs""-- is she still watching and waiting for something even after the sunset has extinguished that parade of shadows? Indeed, a line about a body ""swaying like a drunkard"" and a trio of ruminations on Gibson's mother, father, and sister on closing track ""Glory"" are among the few moments where we're transported from Gibson's head to someplace outside. Yet for all of the singer's insularity, she never sounds alone on Beasts of Seasons, thanks to a mostly exquisite array of backing arrangements courtesy of a host of PDX luminaries, including Laura Veirs, labelmate Shelly Short, and members of the Decemberists, M. Ward's band, Menomena, and Norfolk & Western. ""Spirited"", easily the record's liveliest track, gets a boost from a chorus of ""OOH-ooh-OOH""s and booming percussion-work that keep things moving at a steady cantor, while ""Where Have All Your Good Words Gone?""'s fatalistic imagery rubs up against foreboding timpani rolls and chilly fiddle-playing that calls to mind Death bowing the buried to life in Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. As a singer, Gibson treats syllables with the same patience and loving precision a mosaic maker might put into cutting and arranging his/her tiles. It comes as little surprise, then, that words are a lyrical preoccupation of Gibson's throughout Beasts of Seasons. On ""Come By Storm"", the singer recalls how she ""took great care with words,"" and, later, how she loses herself to them. ""Spirited"" finds her describing how ""morning tends to... turn our words to smoke,"" while the aforementioned ""Where Have All Your Good Words Gone?"" has her grappling with the loss of a loved one by asking, ""Where are all the pleasures from the timbre of your tongue?"" Yet for all her talk of words, Gibson allows herself a fairly limited lexicon on Beasts of Seasons. If she knows some ""good"" ones like her sesquipedalian-prone onetime tourmate and fellow Portlander Colin Meloy, she wisely forgoes them in favor of repeated references to bodies and bones, trees and tongues, pictures, poems, and stories-- all of which lend the record a reflexivity that rewards repeat listens.","The Pac NW coughs up folksy, understated singer-songwriters by the coffeehouseful, but this Portland-based singer shouldn't become lost in that crowd.

Heavy Ghost,DM Stith,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3115e6ef95969320575/1:1/w_160/a9b342b8.jpeg,2009-03-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12814-heavy-ghost/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Skimming his website, one might get the impression that David Stith, who records as DM Stith, takes his music seriously, but perhaps not that seriously. ""Heavy Ghost is streaming in its entirety over at AsthmaticKitty.com!"" he blogged recently, alluding to the impending release of his full-length debut. ""I recommend steamed potatoes as an accompaniment. Steam them, then fry them a little, then shake some soy sauce over them. I had mine sliced an eighth of an inch thin and they were delish. Fever's still here but I'm full of yum. And a little broccoli. Excellent."" But Stith's casually quotidian conflation of his cooking and craft (overlooking, for now, the intimation of illness) is belied by the weight of Heavy Ghost itself, a perfectly named disc. A designer by trade, Stith has apparently always been musically inclined, but it took working with Shara Worden on My Brightest Diamond's bow to serve as a catalyst for releasing his own works. Yet it's hard to imagine Stith keeping this music bottled up and private for so long. ""Music feels less like striving for acceptance and more like life,"" wrote Stith on his site a few posts earlier, and that admission provides a more accurate glimpse into the subconscious but intensely spiritual inclinations that make Stith's idiosyncratic songs tick. As for just what those songs constitute, well, that's a tall order. As a vocalist, Stith shares some soft-spoken similarities with the ever wistful Robert Wyatt, especially on tracks such as ""BMB"", ""Creekmouth"", ""Thanksgiving Moon"", and ""Morning Glory Cloud"", but as with Wyatt's own records the music's difficult to encapsulate. Here that beguiling elusiveness manifests itself as a sort of eerie chamber cabaret, full of distant choirs and hypnotic percussion, folky interludes and dissonant deconstructions, augmented by strange scraping and strumming and the occasional striking shift from minor to major chord. It's this push and pull between equally mysterious poles that makes songs such as ""Pigs"" and ""Pity Dance"" so entrancing, if ultimately, intriguingly tough to pin down. Elusiveness can be a frustrating quality in music, rebuffing any attempts to engage and often leaving the song suspended in a state of untouchable purgatory, but here that elusiveness works largely in Stith's favor. As tough as it may be to pin down the pastoral but still somehow strikingly tense ""Fire of Birds"" or the stunning emotional catharsis of ""Braid of Voices"", the experience of being trapped with Stith in such a strange, sui generis little world is in some ways compensation enough, even if the odd, unpredictable melodies and structures make a quick embrace impossible. Heavy Ghost is music that demands attention but rarely acts out as an easy means of getting it. It's an impressively dense and mature work, and without a doubt sometimes tough listening, too, but somehow not hard to listen to, let alone hard to like. It's almost as if Stith is meeting the listener halfway but no more than that, keeping his distance rather than helping us over that final hurdle. No, that would be ""striving for acceptance,"" and therefore unacceptable. Rather, Heavy Ghost is, in Stith's words, ""more like life:"" sometimes challenging, sometimes confusing, but, in the end, rewarding.","A designer by trade, this My Brightest Diamond protégé is proving himself an adept songwriter as well.

The Tiffany Transcriptions,Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b8ea9e61561daa4af1/1:1/w_160/bc75d350.jpeg,2009-03-17 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12742-the-tiffany-transcriptions/,Collector's Choice,"During the 1930s and 40s, with the Great Depression bankrupting farms and World War II bolstering manufacturing, America witnessed a massive population shift that carried many Midwesterners to the West Coast to work first in citrus groves and eventually in military factories. They brought with them their musical tastes, which were often derided by Californians but which created a market for Texas swing far beyond the Dust Bowl. In this environment, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys flourished: He appeared in Hollywood westerns, played to enormous crowds from San Diego to Seattle, and-- with a handful of performers like Spade Cooley and Tex Ritter-- dominated country & western radio. In an attempt to expand his audience and further entrench His Texas Playboys (as well as his offshoot groups, led by his brother and various associates) as a pre-eminent touring act, Wills formed Tiffany Music, Inc. with a radio disc jockey named Cactus Jack and a businessman named Clifford Sundin, with the intent of syndicating performances to radio stations across the country. Wills and the revolving line-up of Playboys recorded 26 radio specials between tours, showcasing an incredibly wide repertoire that included his biggest hits, raucous live staples, and an array of covers. For three decades, the transcriptions sat in Sundin's archive, until Kaleidoscope Records purchased the masters, edited them to 150 songs, and distributed a 10-record set through Rhino starting in 1981. Collector's Choice has based its new set on that release, replicating the tracklist on ten discs and adding liner notes by usual suspect Rich Kienzle. It's difficult to overstate the set's importance, as it allows a valuable glimpse into the group's creative process and musical prowess, but The Tiffany Transcriptions is no dusty artifact: This is Texas swing at its rowdiest and most anarchic, corralling jazz, blues, swing, jug band, and Zydeco stomps and reels into a distinctly American sound that has more than a little in common with the rock'n'roll of the next decade. Because these transcriptions were recorded between the Texas Playboys' long tours throughout the left half of the United States, these songs sound practiced and a little punchy, with a rawness not heard in the more popular studio versions. Wills directed his band in much the same way as his more urban counterparts, taking the conductor's role and calling out sidemen to solo. Only, his sidemen soloed on string instruments-- fiddle, mandolin, and acoustic, electric, steel, and pedal steel guitar-- instead of horns. That made the 16-inch format of the transcriptions ideal for the Texas Playboys: With more room to stretch out in a song, the crack band could really cut loose, taking more solos and locking into longer jams that only hint at their rambunctious live shows. The Tiffany Transcriptions includes 150 songs and only one repeated (as both an instrumental and a vocal), which gives an idea of their vast repertoire that ranged from Texas songwriter Cindy Walker to New Yorkers Cole Porter and Billy Strayhorn to Singing Brakeman Jimmie Rodgers. At ten CDs (each handsomely packaged in gatefold cases with period artwork), the set is enormous and daunting, but there are enough jaw-dropping moments to make it more than accessible. Listen to Lester ""Junior"" Barnard's electric guitar snaking into the solo on ""Take Me Back to Tulsa"". Or Wills egging on piano player Millard Kelso and guitarist Eldon Shamblin on ""At the Woodchopper's Ball"". Or Alex Brashear's jazzy trumpet high-stepping through ""I Had Someone Else Before I Had You"". Or Wills tripping up Tommy Duncan's straight-man vocals on, well, just about any song. Or the way their road-weary dynamic makes this the definitive version of ""San Antonio Rose"" (never mind that it's titled here ""Lum & Abner Special (San Antonio Rose)""). Or Tiny Moore's otherworldly electric mandolin solo on ""Playboy Chimes"". Or Dean & Evelyn McKinney's sisterly harmonies on the tenth disc. I could go on and on. I could also climb inside this box and live for a few years. Tiffany Music, Inc. was not especially profitable. By and large, the stations that picked up the series were already playing Wills' music, and under these call letters, the Tiffany series was wildly popular. But their number was too small to expand Wills' market, with most non-C&W stations attaching a bumpkin stigma to the music, and the company shut down before all 26 transcriptions were distributed. The venture may have failed financially, but it left us an undeniable musical success.","Texas swing at its rowdiest and most anarchic, corralling jazz, blues, swing, jug band, and Zydeco stomps and reels into a distinctly American sound.

Fist of God,MSTRKRFT,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32cea9e61561daa4c07/1:1/w_160/3ec94419.jpg,2009-03-17 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12835-fist-of-god/,Dim MakDowntown,"At the beginning of ""Click Click"", guest E-40 says, ""MSTRKRFT, what is it doe,"" dwarfed by a maelstrom of pulverizing riffs that seem to come with their own laser show. What it is, for E-40, turns out to be something of an endurance test: Even the limber-tongued rapper struggles to assert himself through the breakneck pace of MSTRKRFT's power chords. It's like listening to someone trying to rap in a lightning field. This is a telling moment on an album that always seems to be shouting over itself, a tone that accounts for Fist of God's virtues and shortcomings alike. Jesse F. Keeler still played bass and synths in Death from Above 1979 when he formed MSTRKRFT with producer Alex Puodziukas (aka. Al-P), which is now his primary endeavor. The transition represents Keeler gradually weaning himself off of rock, trading his bass guitar for various consoles and his dance-inflected rock music for rock-inflected dance music. Indebted to Daft Punk's vocal-infused robo-house, Justice's arena-sized stomp, and Vitalic's tooth-grinding tunnels of distortion, Fist of God has an metallic quality that doesn't falter even when riffage occasionally subsides, like on John Legend vehicle ""Heartbreaker"", where piano phrases seem wrought in gleaming chrome. More often, the tracks are comprised of loops caught perfectly between guitar- and synth-sounds. MSTRKRFT use delay, reverb, attack adjustments, and distortion to carve up these loops, reveling in quicksand bass and scintillating treble. At their most aggressive, the various strands of each track seem locked in mortal combat. ""1000 Cigarettes"" is like an electro-funk version of ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"", with Eddie Van Halen as Johnny and a Roland drum machine as the devil. Fist of God improves on MSTRKRFT's first effort, The Looks, simply by jettisoning its omnipresent vocoder. If anything, it's too well-groomed, despite its wild-out vibe. There's a whiff of genre-exercise in the way strobe-light drum claps telegraph whooshing surges, vocal snips crisply striate each measure on the title track, and each contorting lick moves inexorably through real-time filter sweeps. With an ever-expanding collection of hardware and software, samples and sound banks, analog and digital synths, MSTRKRFT's sound is formally pristine, but a few stray hairs would lend it more character. As it stands, Fist of God is a roundly enjoyable album with few highs and lows. A couple of the cameos are worthwhile: N.O.R.E.'s turn on ""Bounce"" suits the record's tone, and the track rates a prestige-bolstering remix on A-Trak's forthcoming mix album, Infinity + 1. Freeway is game and energetic on the alternate mix of ""1000 Cigarettes"", although he sounds rushed (and you can imagine how gnarly a track must be to rush Freeway), and Little Moe's deep-house diva turn on ""It Ain't Love"" holds up surprisingly well against the track's dot-matrix abrasion. John Legend's incredibly insipid lyrics about butterflies and rainbows don't do ""Heartbreaker"" any favors, but neither do they completely ruin it. It's a mystery why Jamal of soul-punk band the Carps warranted two guest spots, as both are profoundly anonymous. And what the hell happened with ""Word Up"", the Ghostface collab? His warm-up chatter predicts a firebrand verse that never arrives-- instead, a couple of innocuous phrases (""word up,"" ""do it hard"") get cut up in uninteresting ways with clipped rave sirens and gymnastic synth-bass. You have to wonder if they got Ghost in the studio and then couldn't get anything worthwhile out of him, but you can't blame them for attempting to work with what they got-- would you pass up the chance to write ""feat. Ghostface Killah"" on your tracklist? In a way, this is representative of the album-- it's got all the right moves in place, but MSTRKRFT's handle on content is still slightly lagging behind their facility for tone and form. But if you're just looking for well-turned, rock-friendly, dance-party fodder, you could do a lot worse than Fist of God.","Latest from half of the sadly departed DFA79 always seems to be shouting over itself, a tone that accounts for its virtues and shortcomings alike.

"Baby, They Told Us We Would Rise Again",Bloodkin,by: Stephen M.

They're survivors, which isn't a comment on the music but a comment on the fact that they're still making music, undeterred in the mission despite the ups and downs implied by that album title. Then again, maybe that's a nod to geography: Principles Eric Carter and Daniel Hutchens hail from West Virginia, but have been based in Athens, Ga., for years-- and sound like it. Or that title could be about zombies. For many listeners, Baby, They Told Us We Would Rise Again will be their first exposure to Bloodkin, and many others heard them open for the Drive-By Truckers. There are enough musical similarities between the two bands, though, that it seems perfectly natural that Mike Cooley would cameo on Rise Again, David Barbe would produce it, and Patterson Hood would write the liner notes. Bloodkin scribble with their guitars, creating churning ambience as well as cab-forward riffs. The guitar licks on ""Easter Eggs"" shoot like sparks from a campfire, peel paint on ""Ghost Runner"", course like heroin through the addiction lament ""The Viper"", which builds to a climax with Orenda Fink's trumpet. They see beyond the Truckers, though, to drivin' n cryin' and Georgia Satellites, to Skynyrd (of course) and .38 Special, yet the accomplishment of Rise Again is that Bloodkin manage to sound like so many other acts but most of all like themselves. And because they're Southerners by choice, there's a literary bent to Rise Again, as if the legacy of Faulkner or even the Beats were alive on vinyl rather than in ink (Hutchens proclaims himself the ""bastard son of Neal Cassady""). The words are more carefully chosen and placed than the notes, as it usually is with the best southern rock bands. Occasionally the imagery can be a bit pat, as on ""Rhododendron"", when Hutchens sings, ""Life is a mystery, but it's fragrant as an apple tree,"" as the guitars crash into each other. On the other hand, considering the mean highway they've traveled, they've earned the right to such placid similes. On the other hand, Bloodkin may be at their catchiest and most quotable when they're at their funniest. ""Heavy With Child"" is a litany of reasons to be happy, some sincere and some sarcastic. ""I'm so happy you're heavy with child."" ""I'm so happy that you're a real blonde."" ""I'm so happy the bathroom door locks."" And so on. But when Hutchens admits ""I'm so happy we're living the dream,"" he sounds like he means it, and the song's true meaning becomes clear: These are the reasons that make a happy, albeit imperfect, union, where the good outweighs the bad. Or, as they theorize on the road anthem ""A Place to Crash"": ""I think what saved us was we never lost that feel."" Here's hoping they never do.","Recent Drive-By Truckers openers issues their eighth album in 23 years of hauling ass around the country, playing to every kind of crowd.

To Lose My Life...,White Lies,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a300b1335d7bf169860a/1:1/w_160/b9b2f396.jpeg,2009-03-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12801-to-lose-my-life/,Fiction,"Two months after Ian Curtis died, Bono stopped by the desk of Factory Records founder Tony Wilson and said something like, ""Now he's gone, I promise you I'll do it for him."" At least that's what Wilson later told critic Simon Reynolds. U2 soldiered on without Joy Divison's gothy glamor, and of course Bono wasn't the only one carrying an unforgettable fire for Curtis. Then and since, a long list of bands have tried fusing U2's stadium-size grandiosity with Joy Division's bleak foreboding. Sometimes they're Radiohead, sometimes they're Interpol, and sometimes they're White Lies. The most relevant current comparison is probably Glasvegas, another UK band groomed early on for success, only to release a disappointingly ponderous debut album. Except where Glasvegas' roots in girl-group, JAMC, and early Creation bands amounted to an Exciting New Direction in the beleaguered British indie scene, White Lies have been striking the usual post-punk moves ever since a pair of Stephen Street-produced singles in 2006, back when they were called Fear of Flying. White Lies' debut To Lose My Life... recently entered the UK charts at #1 and combines prose-purple darkness with rafters-shooting arena rock. It's better than Elefant, worse than the Stills, nearly on par with Editors-- which in the English rock press these days assures descriptors like ""classic"" and ""masterpiece."" Produced by Ed Buller (Pulp, Suede) and Max Dingel (the Killers, Glasvegas), and boasting melodramatic accompaniment by a 20-piece orchestra, To Lose My Life... can't be faulted in terms of tightness or radio-ready polish. If you liked the new Oasis and U2 records, never bought Turn on the Bright Lights, and tend to ignore clumsy lyrics, you might enjoy raising your beer to this album just fine. Hell, the hummable Cars-esque new wave at the bridge of dour opening track ""Death"" is just what you needed if you're willing to forget ""Just What I Needed"". But White Lies know beer is really more for staring at glumly: ""Everything has got to be love or death,"" singer/guitarist Harry McVeigh declares. Why not both? ""Let's grow old together and die at the same time,"" the title track urges, certainly not the last time someone will rewrite the Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" by way of the Modern Lovers' ""Dignified and Old"", crank up the bombast, and leave out all pathos, personality, and charm. White Lies' flirtations with mortality certainly don't help their drab tunes. ""If you tell me to jump then I'll die,"" goes the galloping ""E.S.T.""; ""As you said goodbye, I almost died,"" the weepy ""Nothing to Give"" adds. But their rote cheerlessness suggests no such emotional intensity. As McVeigh sings on POW-invoking sub-Joshua Tree ballad ""Fifty on Our Foreheads"", ""All we heard was lies about the truth."" Right, as opposed to the other kind of lies. White Lies could even get away with a little heavy-handed somberness if anything of their own (other than unintentional humor) shone through their reconstituted gloom-rock. A little less death, a little more love-- of creativity, of life in all its urgent particulars rather than just the hand-me-down cliches that stand in for them-- would go a long way. Take ""Unfinished Business"", where gothic organs, Interpol-like phrasing, and a jarring James Bond allusion convey little other than that White Lies own a few critically acclaimed records and probably know who Roger Moore is. ""Love and death are always on my mind,"" the Stills sang back in 2003. In other words, White Lies are boring and stuff.","Lots of bands emulate bits of Joy Division. Sometimes they're Radiohead, sometimes they're Interpol, and, alas, sometimes they're White Lies.

But it's probably fair to say that his records tend to work best when focused on a specific theme. Take Interstellar Space Revisited, his live album with Gregg Bendian that re-imagined the legendary John Coltrane-Rasheed Ali classic, or Ash and Tabula: Out Trios Vol. 3, a set of full-speed improvisations with Andrea Parkins and Tom Rainey. Both are smart, sharp, and consistent. On the other hand, consider albums by his group the Nels Cline Singers-- all interesting, but also, as Aaron Leitko put it in a Pitchfork review, ""schizophrenic"" and ""hard to pin down... Because of this constantly shifting focus it's hard to call any one album the definitive Nels Cline statement,"" Leitko wrote. ""Each record is just another group of solid but diffuse tunes."" The same applies to Cline's latest, the solo, all-instrumental Coward. According to a press release*,* the album resulted from him ""contemplating a solo overdub project for nearly 25 years."" So one might expect the record to be focused, and in fact each track has a clear, well-executed purpose. But as a whole, Coward is pretty schizoid. Spinning through delicate acoustics, genre homages, abstract meditations, and even an electro-funk number, Cline wanders around the map without much concern for connecting the dots. This dizzying diversity makes Coward less an album than a collection of unrelated essays. It's easy to admire, not too tough to enjoy-- but the abrupt stylistic shifts make it hard to love. Still, examining individual tracks reveals a wealth of interesting music. Opener ""Epiphyllum"" builds a tense, textured drone, while the obviously-titled ""Thurston County"" does a convincing impression of the Sonic Youth guitarist's Branca-punk style, yet gains enough momentum to become a worthy rocker in its own right. Even better are two acoustic guitar pieces, ""The Divine Homegirl"" and ""The Nomad's Home"", whose precise, patient tones recall the prettier tunes from Sir Richard Bishop's Polytheistic Fragments. The other acoustic pieces on Coward are less compelling, more like exercises in Derek Bailey or John Fahey scholarship than coherent songs. But even there, Cline's devotion and energy are never in doubt. One section of Coward, a six-track suite dubbed ""Onan"", actually retains some thematic consistency, with a darkly insistent mood running throughout. Still, here again we get so much hopping around-- from the post-rock drama of ""II: Lord and Lady"", to the Pink Floyd psych of ""IV: Interruption (Onan's Psychedelic Breakdown)"", to the Black Dice throb of ""V: Seedcaster""-- that it's nearly impossible to get hooked by all the tonal leaps that Cline so quickly and effortlessly glides through. It's perhaps unfair to fault Cline for stretching his many creative limbs-- the guy has long been adept at every conceivable guitar sound, and he could probably base a full album on each mode he employs here. But it's also likely that such albums would be more memorable than this one, whose songs are hard to recall once Cline has discarded them and jumped forward. There's no doubt that  Coward is a worthy addition to his canon, but the chances of it being anyone's go-to Cline disc are roughly the same as someone listing a compilation as their favorite album.","Spinning through delicate acoustics, genre homages, abstract meditations, and electro-funk, Wilco guitarist Nels Cline offers an eclectic new LP.

Froberg has a long legacy to live up to-- if he didn't want albatrosses like Drive Like Jehu or Hot Snakes around his neck, he should have been in bands that were less awesome-- but while there's evidence of growth here, there's not enough change to alienate fans. If they can appreciate a little less mania and a little more melody, I Blame You will be a comfortable fit. Along with the voice that fronted his old band, Froberg carries the same staunch, traditional, almost obstinate approach to guitar-driven rock'n'roll. He even continues his streak of doing all the artwork for his albums. Despite a tongue-in-cheek cover claiming it's ""Xtra Compressed for Maximum Listener Fatigue""-- another shot at modern recording methods and another window into Froberg's own ideals-- I Blame You just sounds right: dueling guitars that have refined the echo and twang of surf and rockabilly into a sharp edge, basslines that are less walking than swaggering, drums too respectful and too evil for elaborate fills. Yet with all that, it is probably Froberg's most melodic and diverse record. ""Widow of My Dreams"" treads familiar ground with a descending surf-rock riff and a few hair-raising guitar bends, and ""Two-Headed Coin"" is the album's catchiest and most linear track, built on a foundation of shimmying bass and the shake of maracas. The span of ""Pine On"" to ""Fake Kinkade"" is more than enough proof that no one has lost their touch, but outside of a rather jagged Snakes-esque run through of an old blues track by Kokomo Arnold, ""Mllk Cow Blues"", those songs are the exceptions rather than the norm. Some of that aforementioned diversity translates into filler, including the meandering ""Run"", led by second vocalist/guitarist Sohrab Habibion, and the instrumental title track-- and that's just side A. Hearing Froberg later chart a failed relationship over the mid-tempo earnestness of ""SUD"" is rather leaden, but he takes a different tack with the same subject on closer ""Back and Forth"". The ""Be My Baby"" beat seems a little easy for someone like Froberg, who's found plenty of ways to rock convincingly on countless records without ever being obvious. But the winking retread and simple shout-a-long chorus doesn't sound tired here-- it sounds earned. That's possibly in part due to Froberg's lyrics being no less cynical when slowing it down (""You say that nobody ever knows anyone at at all/ That's not true; I know you""). Nor is the album deficient for lacking big choruses or muscular shock and awe; in fact, many of this record's best surprises are moments like when the white-knuckle ascending riff of ""Light Sweet Crude"" recedes into a quieter, simmering chorus, something more appropriate for a low-gear pursuit on a dark, winding road than a high-octane highway chase. It's great that the band can slow down and still hold attention, and one hopes Obits will dig deeper and find new thrills in old traditions in the coming years.","Former Drive Like Jehu and Hot Snakes singer/guitarist Rick Froberg unveils his new Sub Pop project.

Why There Are Mountains,Cymbals Eat Guitars,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3225e6ef9596932059c/1:1/w_160/e2776342.png,2009-03-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12826-why-there-are-mountains/,self-released,"Plenty of bands want to take you higher and even more are looking to get you down, but it's increasingly rare to find a record that sounds good with a AAA guidebook and a few hours to get to god knows where, as long as it's somewhere else. Despite the unabated use of adjectives like ""sprawling"" or ""sweeping"" or ""epic,"" the indie road trip album has become something of a lost art, with bands mostly forgoing dense, pent-up instrumentation that slowly unfurls and releases-- you know, that lonesome crowded sound. You could blame it on so many bands being from autophobic NYC, or that the Pacific Northwest gods of indie are still going too strong to already be a primary influence, but neither would explain New York's Cymbals Eat Guitars' Why There Are Mountains. While there's plenty of geographical signifiers on their debut, it's almost topographic in its approach, without hooks and choruses so much as map-like layouts of mountains and sloping valleys. Six-minute opener ""...And the Hazy Sea"" has Why They Are Mountains sounding like it could immediately implode, kicking off with the kind of cataclysmic blowout Built to Spill used to get to in a few minutes' less time. Occasionally adding reverbed guitar and electric piano to give an eye-of-the-storm calm, the band reaches about six different crescendos; it's less showy theatrics than Cymbals Eat Guitars just packing a lot of ideas into their songs. It's tough to consider structures this unpredictable to be templates, but upon hearing the subtle instrumental shifts of ""Indiana"" evolving from noise-rock interlude to a horn-led piano waltz, you locate a certain pretzel logic in these songs-within-songs. Yelpy and adenoidal, bombastic and yet unkempt, you could pretty much slap a sticker on this thing saying ""RIYL: indie rock."" ""Some Trees (Merritt Moon)"" emerges from the feedback exhaust of ""...And the Hazy Sea"" into two minutes of tightly coiled post-punk dance and strangulated, sugary hooks. At first an environmentalist's lament of suburban sprawl, a much more sinister effect of deforestation is revealed-- ""I was thankful for the mystery/ But by the time the girl had hanged herself/ I could have looked out my back window and watched her neck just snap."" CEG are rarely as dark as they are on ""Some Trees"", but besides a sound engineer, the group also shares with Modest Mouse a tendency to turn supremely stoned observations into startling lucidity. Why There Are Mountains gains as much impact from its quieter moments, especially ""Share"", which parlays queasy, whammy-bar shoegaze atmosphere into a defeated, yet regal procession of horns. As its followed by ""What Dogs See"", four minutes of echoing rubble and near spoken-word mumbles, it initially seems like a pokey bit of sequencing, but the song evolves into a prelude to the deceptively bouncy ""Wind Phoenix"", which turns personal devastation into a sing-along. The scattered lyrics could pass for a whimsical recollection of an Indiana youth spent watching Notre Dame football and listening to Sub Pop until you focus on the song's macabre laments. What's most admirable about this sophisticated self-released debut is Cymbals Eat Guitars' willingness to think big with gestures that shouldn't fly in the hands of a young band, instrumentally or thematically. Occasionally, albeit rarely, it leads them astray, as in the closer ""Like Blood Does"", where the group dawdles a bit too long before reaching its arresting conclusion. But that's a minor quibble considering how Why There Are Mountains ends up being like any great result of wanderlust-- here, the journey is the end not the means; fortunately, that gives Why There Are Mountains astounding replay value.","Plucking influences from 90s indie rock isn't new, but Cymbals Eat Guitars perfectly embody that casually ambitious slack-rock sound.

The Otha Side of the Trap...,OJ Da Juiceman,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c79d034d5c69bf2c99/1:1/w_160/5761ac5b.jpeg,2009-03-13 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12755-the-otha-side-of-the-trap/,Asylum,"As Lil Wayne became a household name, an adventure that culminated in a bowling match with Katie Couric, Gucci Mane built organic street buzz by flooding the market with quality rap music. A judge didn't consider this work to be ""community service""-- Gucci was on probation for assaulting a man with a pool cue, a detail memorably documented in 2007's ""I Move Chickens""-- so it was off to the Fulton County jail for 2008's most important mixtape rapper. Once news of Gucci's impending incarceration hit the wire, protégé OJ Da Juiceman's promotions game kicked into high gear; a guest verse on a Project Pat single, successive mixtapes with cartoonish artwork riffing off his nom de plume, and a video single for tense earworm ""I'm Gettin' Money"". And now 2009 dawns with a debut release, a compilation of already-released material with few new tracks, an enjoyable but ultimately confusing consolation prize. It's true that OJ's personality seems slight when compared to Gucci's manic creativity, humor, and range-- compared to Gucci's palette of adlib effects, even OJ's distinctive ""AYE! AYE! AYE!"" can feel one-note. But he does share Gucci's ability to ingratiate himself to the listener. Lyrically, he slots in as a rougher-edges version of Young Dro, sharing his impressionistic embrace of trapper status as signified by colored jewelry, seafood, white boy tags, and his own ""fruity-crazy-stupid-swag."" Unlike Dro, Da Juiceman's raps have a halting quality, and his strained-voice approach feels undistinguished next to Gucci's stuffed-nose ignorant flow. Although OJ's vocals are far from sonorous, trapped in one tone-deaf timbre, that limited range becomes its own aesthetic. The effect is unsettling; when relaxed, his nonchalant calm suggests he hides a murderous instinct; over up-tempo tracks his vocals have a frenzied yelp. But this isn't like Freeway's emotive enthusiasm; for OJ it is a stylistic affect, unconcerned with sincerity, purely conveying visceral style. He embraces the tension between exuberance and nonchalance, as if he's constantly restraining the volume of his voice. The previously unreleased material, what little there is, is promising. ""Batman"" is a breakneck-tempo trapper's version of T.I.'s ""Whatever You Like"" with sizzling synths from beatmaker Fatboi and a classic rapid-fire chorus. It should put doubts about OJ's rapping abilities to rest; fast raps give his shambolic flow a stilted grace. The beats, provided primarily by Gucci's usual crew, including Zaytoven, DJ Speedy, and Fatboi, embrace a crafted ""cheapness""; listen to the horns on DJ Speedy's ""Good Night"", which harmonically aim for uplift, intentionally undercut by the raw rapping and the ""cheap"" synthesized horns, like a southern version of the Lox's ""Wild Out"". Everything is high on treble and heavy on keyboards, absent ""soulful"" signifiers and midrange, with heavy trunk-rattling bass thump. That said, purely on a conceptual level, this record feels unnecessary; much of it had been previously released on mixtapes, and it's not a particularly comprehensive document of those. The unofficial word has been that this is the ""album-before-the-album,"" a chance for his label to test whether OJ's buzz can translate into sales. While it is nice to have these tracks without DJ drops, it's hard to imagine major-label records doing all that much artistically for street rappers these days anyway. Lil Wayne's records were more fun before Tha Carter III dropped. Check OJ's Culinary Art School mixtape now, catch Da Juiceman chopping it up on Rachael Ray's show later.","While Gucci Mane cooled in a cell, his protégé OJ Da Juiceman kicked his promo game into high gear.

Love's Recurring Dream,Coloma,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f2c0084474cd0c016f/1:1/w_160/7d762c41.jpeg,2009-03-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12788-loves-recurring-dream/,Italic,"Coloma always seemed like a group doomed to unfashionability. Six years ago, the duo's second album, Finery, might have seemed like the last word on fusing ""microhouse"" sonics with, you know, proper songs. But it was simultaneously the first-- and, it turns out, solitary-- word on a return of Tim Rice lyricism to pop: Amazingly, Alex Paulick's ear-tickling technicolor arrangements were less florid than singer Rob Taylor's thesaurus-happy songwriting and mannered Broadway vocals. So it's not surprising that Coloma's profile has since been almost non-existent, nor that they immediately began to beat a trail away from the startling modernity of their early work and towards a more familiar and comforting ""real instruments"" sound. Perhaps they've reasoned-- quite sensibly-- that most listeners will only stand for so much scene-stealing idiosyncrasy at once. On the duo's fourth album, Love's Recurring Dream, the transition from sharply etched micro-pop to billowing chamber-pop is almost complete: The music's organic lines are colored in with jazzy drum fills, maudlin trumpets, even anonymously soulful backing vocals. Nonetheless, even leaving aside Taylor's sore-thumb singing, this is clearly the work of the same group. Guitars, harpsichords, and muted horns may have replaced synth burbles and skittery beats, but the arrangements are still by and large prickly and pointillist, each tiny sound burnished to a dazzling sheen. It's a remarkably neat, punctilious sound; whereas once a slightly buzzy bass line might have suggested a hedonistic looseness lurking under the surface, Love's Recurring Dream's composure remains unruffled throughout, offering only starched shirts as far as the ear can hear. Coloma's poetic predilections have also been reined in. Once, the duo's songs sounded scripted more than written and performed, complete with stage instructions like ""turn to audience"" and ""exit stage left."" Love's Recurring Dream retains some of this air (""You look like a dummy in a shopfront... [dramatic pause]... and I mean that as a compliment""), and Taylor still hasn't overcome his fondness for terrible puns (see the found-sound cod-blues mope ""Blue Blood""), but most of the time these songs feel literary rather than verbose, less top-heavy with overblown melodrama than before. All of which makes Coloma seem much more like other stuff you maybe already know and enjoy. In its softer and more traditional moments, Love's Recurring Dream sounds a great deal like Rufus Wainwright if he spent more time paying tribute to Leonard Cohen than Judy Garland. Taylor has always shared a good deal of Wainwright's declamatory, slightly nasal vocal style and his tendency towards lyrical and performative overreach, but the more subdued, soft-focus arrangements sharpen the echoes of Cohen's patient craft. This is undoubtedly a smarter set of stylistic coordinates for the duo, but it's also a safer one: more agreeable, but less idiosyncratic, and correspondingly less demanding of obsession or even a great deal of repeat-listening. Still, when the album tries to summon up a mirage of the band's former, electronically charged sound, the results are very good indeed. ""Do You Know What It Is Yet?"" is charming pastoral-schaffel reminiscent of Borneo & Sporenburg's ""Boys in Shorts"". ""These Days Are Ours"" is breathlessly excited, buoyed by airy xylophone runs and a perky rhythm hidden away under a mountain since the late 1980s. The urgent throb of ""Standstill"" evokes the wide-eyed, widescreen majesty of Simple Minds at their pre-crossover peak. The iridescent echoes of ""Tired of Summer"" discover an uncharted middle-ground between Bark Psychosis and Basic Channel. These occasionally magical moments always come as a surprise, as it's hard to accept that the duo could wrest such startling sounds from such familiar tools. If Love's Recurring Dream proves anything, it's that Coloma were never about technology, but rather a sense of otherworldliness, however it might be acheived. Once, they offered a vision of the past as it might appear to people in the future; here, the duo's music sounds like our own past as it might appear in a dream. Like a dream, it retreats quickly into forgetfulness once you emerge from it, but moments of transfixing eeriness linger like a hazy memory of a memory.","The new one from Coloma sounds a great deal like Rufus Wainwright if he spent more time paying tribute to Leonard Cohen than Judy Garland.

Birdseed Shirt,Deleted Scenes,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2efea9e61561daa4b81/1:1/w_160/8340018b.jpg,2009-03-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12786-birdseed-shirt/,What Delicate,"To some secular types, the most interesting thing about faith is watching someone lose it. When you waver from an ironic disbelief in religion to a stricken doubt in yourself, you've got yourself a great arc. Or as Deleted Scenes put it, more off-handedly, ""Got god, got boring/ Lost god, stayed boring, got drunk."" Birdseed Shirt isn't a record specifically about faith, but they work the theme hard. It carries through as they swing from grizzled jokes to unabashed emo bellows. The disgusted drunken Catholic schoolboy waltz of ""Deacons"" sits easily with the upbeat vibes of ""City That Never Wakes Up"". And the country humility of ""One Long Country Song"" still can't quite take a heartbreak lying down. The band's boast that they're influenced by both the Danielson Famile and Talking Heads holds water, not least because frontman Dan Scheuerman has the range and power to give direction to their genre wanderings. He can carry two vocal modes-- modest, country and a little bit strange, and brave and ferocious; he saves the latter approach for special occasions, always making it pay off. The songwriting is strong throughout the set, and even the short songs aren't slight. With Matt Dowling primarily on bass, Chris Scheffey on guitar, and Brian Hospital on drums, the band is a well-worn quartet that takes risks in the arrangements but never gets clever for the sake of it. They do big indie rock, like the build-up to the horns and harmony vocals that punctuate the opener, ""Turn to Sand"". The singalong and warm guitars of ""Take My Life"" make the deeply emo evocation of suicide surprisingly palatable. But they also picked up the best scraps from post-rock, including the vibes on ""Deacons"" and ""City That Never Wakes Up"", or the organ on ""Fake IDs"", a descendent of Radiohead's ""Let Down"" and the album's must-hear cut. Credit to producer L. Skell, Birdseed Shirt isn't a knock-down-the-walls powerhouse, so much as a well-balanced demonstration of all the band's best sides-- from thoughtful existentialism to friendly irony to strange, drowsy downers. The finale, ""Get Your Shit Together for the Holidays"", encapsulates its spirit: warm and familiar at the outset, sliding into a massive, deliciously echoey climax, with dark lyrics that end on redemption-- except redemption basically means telling the protagonist to get off his or her ass and do the right thing for a couple of days. This is a young band, but they already know that good cheer will only last you so long.","Ferocious and brave, this debut LP is a well-balanced demonstration of both thoughtful existentialism and strange, drowsy downers.

Troubadour,K'naan,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fdb1335d7bf1698603/1:1/w_160/a4d28fde.jpg,2009-03-13 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12799-troubadour/,A&M,"When the name ""Somalia"" penetrates Western consciousness, its invocation is almost invariably horrific, saddening, and dire. We may still most readily associate the nation with the famously disastrous UN peacekeeping missions of the mid-90s (documented in the book and film Black Hawk Down), yet a cursory glance at headlines in 2009 yields news of malnutrition, piracy, and ominous support of Al-Qaeda, and we're reminded that strife, fighting, and famine have been facts of life in Somalia for decades. Somali-born rapper K'naan managed to flee the country in 1991, shortly after the outbreak of its still-ongoing civil war, yet there's no doubt he experienced more than enough violence and destitution in the 1980s under the totalitarian regime of president Siad Barre to last a lifetime. As you'd expect, emerging from one of the fiercest, bloodiest places on the planet has indelibly shaped K'naan's artistry. On his initially unnoticed but ultimately highly acclaimed 2005 debut, The Dusty Foot Philosopher, this intimacy with horror manifested itself in a combination of deeply felt African melodies and bitterly spat rhymes, which unblinkingly held up a picture of Third World hardship presumably exceeding in chaos and misery even the most harrowing upbringing in the ghettoes of the United States. Truth be told, K'naan's weighing of the Somali experience against the inner-city struggles of American rappers became a fairly substantial talking point both on his debut record itself and in the media run-up to his first major-label offering, the newly released Troubadour. K'naan provides enough ammunition for music writers to fashion the comparison into the crux of their profiles and reviews, permitting them to rail against ""bling"" (The Telegraph) and ""braggadocio posturing"" (Spin) without coming off the slightest bit flippant, because hey, K'naan had it far rougher, and he finds current American rap (according to an interview with NPR) to be ""a comedy"" that's ""kind of cute"" in its attempts to be hardcore. Regardless of the fact that I wouldn't last five minutes in Somalia and 50 Cent might not last an hour, it seems rather counterproductive and pointless to even indirectly diminish the very legitimate formative struggles of someone like T.I. or Lil Wayne. But it's hardly surprising, considering K'naan seems to be positing himself (and allowing himself to be posited) as an antidote to conscience-less, spoiled, insular mainstream rap in all kinds of ways. The ambition is admirable, and K'naan's talents are formidable, yet Troubadour suffers from the same shortcomings as many major-label debuts from arresting independent artists. Namely, it tries to do too much and aims to be too many things to too many people. K'naan hasn't yet demonstrated the capacity to be a full-on savior, and Troubadour's noble breadth ends up stretching its protagonist too thin. Without question, Troubadour makes K'naan more accessible and openhearted than the snarling, apoplectic emcee who often sounded like Eminem on his debut. The new album was largely recorded at the Marley-famed Tuff Gong Studio in Jamaica, and at its best finds K'naan remarkably approximating Bob's great gift for conflating the personal and the universal, for crafting broadly appealing global pop that brims with pathos and personality. There's the Lennon-echoing ""Dreamer"", which finds a teenage K'naan quoting A Tribe Called Quest to distract himself from the atrocity in front of his eyes, as well as ""Wavin' Flag"", a melodic gem and a stirring redemption song for the suffering people of his homeland. There's ""Somalia"", with its eerie spare flutes and haunting images of ""coffins closing,"" and the heartbreaking Slumdog-ish ""Fatima"", a devastating story of young love and big dreams dashed in a war zone. And to show cleverness and verve still thrive in an ill-fated land, there's ""15 Minutes Away"", a comically engaging saga about restlessly waiting for Western Union funds that evokes the scamp-ish charm of Mike Skinner. Unfortunately, this big-tent spirit also occasionally dilutes some of the elements that made K'naan's debut so striking. The grooves and hooks of ""I Come Prepared"", ""America"", and ""Take a Minute"" are far more limp than anything on Troubadour's predecessor, which boasted richly native musical explorations like ""Soobax"" and ""Hoobaale"". What's worse, someone decided this coming-out party needed a dose of star power, and so even setting aside the presence of K'naan supporter and facilitator Damian Marley, the album unnecessarily features a sluggish Mos Def (""America""), a totally superfluous Kirk Hammett (""If Rap Gets Jealous""), and a game but jarringly out of place Adam Levine (""Bang Bang""). K'naan may well be prescient in his canny prediction that ""I'll probably win a Grammy"" (""America"") since his remarkable story and positive bent are pitch-perfect bait for such honors. Still, I wish I left Troubadour feeling like I knew more about Somalia than I did going in, and I'm not entirely sure that's the case.","Somali-born MC is positing himself as an antidote to what he considers conscience-less, spoiled, insular mainstream rap.

Grrr...,Bishop Allen,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a328c0084474cd0c01eb/1:1/w_160/7ff6a348.jpg,2009-03-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12831-grrr/,Dead Oceans,"Recorded and mixed by the excellent Bryce Goggin, Grrr... sounds immaculate: The guitars are sharp. The drums are steady. The harmonies are supple. Its various strings, shakers, and horns captured and layered into a well-spaced, easily listenable whole. After a spin or three, a handful of Grrr...'s 13 tracks should stick, too, whether it's the vibraphone-abetted ""The Lion & the Teacup"" or the squiggling, lustful plunder-like-pirates number, ""Shanghaied"". And maybe being swept up by a hook or two is enough, but much like the politely irritated word it takes for its name, the too-pleasant Grrr... concedes to middle-of-the-road safety, hoping to offend no one and, in the process, says absolutely nothing. Music that's safe, of course, isn't necessarily worthy of derision, especially if its origins and aims are pedestrian. If you're criticizing Jason Mraz for writing ""I'm Yours"" to push a few hundred thousand units, you're picking an easy and misguided fight. But, complete with references to Pliny the Elder's ornithological bent, their borough's rooftop activities, and a friend's broken vinyl records, Grrr... is by, of, and for indie kids. In fact, Bishop Allen regularly remind us their protagonists are apart from and above the masses: Characters climb roofs and hit the road in idealized beatnik fashion. They leave everyone else behind, staring down from the tops of buildings or forgetting people's names when they cross state lines. They treat the rest of the world as a quaint curiosity. What's more, Bishop Allen's narrators see their surroundings solipsistically. The world is theirs for the using, Bishop Allen suggests, an idea epitomized by the mercurial character of ""Dirt on Your New Shoes"". She turns seashells into her necklace, the ground into her mattress, and the band into her jukebox. And worse, Bishop Allen's subjects suggest the world has no bigger worry than their feelings. When the South China moon shines down, it burns ""a hole in my head out of spite."" The particularly unstable narrator of ""Rooftop Brawl"" startles that the sun still shines, not that he's lived long enough to see it again. That is, he fancies that the world's fate hinges on his ability to outlast his depression through the night. Fuck you and me and all y'all, really: The sun rises only for him. So this batch of smug tunes comes aimed above or around the lot of us, but it's not a significant loss. In their neat instrumental outfits-- where everything is mannerly and tucked and where a distorted guitar actually sounds parodic-- these songs serve mostly as reminders that songwriters singing about love, wounded friends, and hitting the road have long done this stuff better, both through more relevant references and less banal sonics. Musically, these songs don't deserve to pretend they're better than anything else. That's too bad, as Bishop Allen's 2006 monthly EP series suggested a band of guileless but educated, prolific but considered romantics. Back then, Bishop Allen could turn moving a piano into heart-quaking triumph (""Corazon"") or meeting a mistaken woman into reassuring compassion (""Bellingham""). A sense of musical delight and adventurousness served those EPs well. Mixing docile acoustic waltzes with clashing, blunt bar rock, Bishop Allen sounded eager to explore all corners of pop. But even when Bishop Allen regales with the crazy sights they've seen or the tough lives they've lived, Grrr... seems transcribed from a distant memory or read from the pages of a script (Sullivan's Travels perhaps, or O Brother, Where Art Thou?). In the movie Mutual Appreciation, Bishop Allen frontman Justin Rice played an aspiring singer-songwriter named Alan who said he was looking for experience, not happiness. Five years later, Rice's real band-- which has never sounded so woefully self-involved and unengaged-- would do well to heed that advice.","Bishop Allen's 2006 monthly EP series suggested a band of educated romantics.

Reincarnations: The Remix Chapter 2001-2009,DJ Koze,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2dac0084474cd0c0135/1:1/w_160/f2b061d4.jpeg,2009-03-12 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12769-reincarnations-the-remix-chapter-2001-2009/,Get Physical,"It was fitting that Germany's Stefan Kozalla-- aka DJ Koze/Adolf Noise and one-half of techno-pop duo International Pony-- wound up the dance producer tapped to remix Battles' slippery electronic-rock single ""Atlas"" back in 2007. Obviously there was the track's queer bounce, the future-retro glam-rock rhythm partly inspired by Battles' interest in German ""schaffel"" techno, a sound pioneered by the Kompakt label, one of Koze's benefactors. But also: Go back and listen to Battles' Mirrored. Then throw on Reincarnations, this bulging new collection of Koze remixes. Rhythmically, they have next to nothing in common. Instead, they're two albums that delight in the goofy-unto-surreal things electronics can do to the human voice. There's hardly a track on Reincarnations that's not peppered with tweaked vocals. Koze is a devotee of the ancient art of the vocoder or its modern-day software plug-in equivalent. He loves to use gender-flipping filters to turn his singers into robot androgynes. And he's not above a David Seville-ian blast of pitch-shifting just for fun. Sometimes, as on the sublimely silly ""Minimal"" by Matias Aguayo, the vocal is outlandish enough that Koze can more or less stay out of its way. And other times, as on Matthew Dear's ""Elementary Lover"", Koze the remixer overstuffs the track's four minutes-- from arch, starched whiteboy funk to a Venusian stadium rock outro. If you're cringing slightly at the thought of yet another techno remix album filled with identikit instrumentals, know that Koze's vocal play on Reincarnations adds new facets to already interesting tracks and turns boring cuts beguiling. And lest you think his cut-ups are all laughs, there's nothing comedic about Koze's take on the laid-back funk of Heiko Voss' ""Think About You"". Instead he stretches the ""I"" in the ""I think about you"" refrain into an angelic background hum that sets the whole track swooning. It's a subtle move that points up the other thing that makes Reincarnations so listenable: Koze's craftsmanship, which is often put in the service of the kind of spaced-out, gentle loveliness that characterizes the ""Think About You"" remix. He may have a shameless a weakness for novelty shock tactics, but Koze's also a big softie with deft touch. The aforementioned ""Atlas"" remix is on the one hand truly perverse, stripping away that big, booming, instantly recognizable schaffel beat for fractured mid-tempo micro-rhythms. But its oddness becomes enchanting when the drums drop out entirely for a twinkling breakdown straight out of the late-1990s IDM school of music box melodies. Indeed, Koze's breakdowns alone elevate many of these tracks, even the ""already good"" ones: the water-torture pauses in Sascha Funke's ""Mango Cookie""; the rave-y bleeps colliding with smeary swells of strings on Malaria's ""Kaltes Klares Wasser (DJ Koze & the Tease Remix)"". Reincarnations isn't flawless. Koze's take on Lawrence's ""Rabbit Tube"", for instance, settles for the kind of passable but generic minimal techno that's so temple-clutchingly dull across an entire album. But the fact that the ""Rabbit Tube"" remix acts more as a palette cleanser here, slipped between Koze's sonically restless techno-pop (Wechsel Garland's ""Swim"", with its long, silty intro) and dancefloor experiments (the drunken jazz of Noze's ""Danse Avec Moi""), points out how effectively Reincarnations is programmed, if nothing else. That ear for sequencing means Koze's fashioned that rarest of remix albums: the kind might play start to finish, and more than once.","Like Battles' Mirrored, this Kompakt remix album delights in the goofy-unto-surreal things electronics can do to the human voice.

Fleischmann,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e35e6ef9596932050f/1:1/w_160/53d94d1d.jpeg,2009-03-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12777-angst-is-not-a-weltanschauung/,Morr,"Bernhard Fleischmann makes it look easy, turning out sensitive electronica thick with detail and feeling. Lately, on Angst Is not a Weltanschauung!, his seventh or fifth album-- not even his label can agree on the number-- he's been wandering a little beyond his remit. An older track of his, ""Phones and Machines"", a standout from 2006's The Humbucking Coil, was a typical hunk of skittery digitalia, forthright in emotion and playfully oblique in composition. Angst 's ""Phones, Machines and King Kong"" builds on this track, riveting above it Daniel Johnston's ""King Kong"", diminishing the haunting quality of Johnston's heartfelt song. It's an impossible task, to hold on to the deeply personal resonance that Johnston drew into his song, but although it falters on those terms, Fleischmann's ambitious mash-up does offer a number of neat surprises. The other collaborations trade in transformation, too, with a little more success. Take ""24.12"", where Sweet William Van Ghost stars in a miniature Christmas romance manque that hinges, improbably, on borrowing ice from a neighbor. Sweeter than this desperate gesture is Fleischmann's carefully programmed percussion, and the husky quaver of Marilies Jagsch, which blanket the song with a wintry sparkle, and maybe a bit of saccharine. But the flinty-widow feminism at the heart of it, and a Christmasy falling-snow guitar figure in the background, catches you off-guard with its delightful moral and sonic complexity. Another Van Ghost piece, ""In Trains"", gives over more space to the earthy tremble of his voice, an instrument that shares its rusty, heartworn finish with John Cale and Lee Hazlewood. All these tracks work because they leave behind IDM traditions, more or less. Others are more faithful. Though it may not merit the iffy label ""intelligent dance music,"" ""When Last We Met at a T&TT Concert"" points toward the bubble and glisten and space of Richard D. James's ambient period, the amorphousness disciplined slightly into a pop structure. Compared to the rest, however, instrumentals like this are not the standouts here. The idiosyncratic duets and mash-up make that clear enough, but for once, even Fleischmann's own notoriously flawed singing outclasses his wordless pieces. In fact, on Angst, the two tracks graced with his vocals (the eulogies ""Even Your Glasses Miss Your Eyes"" and ""Still See You Smile"") are among his most potent, less for their arrangements than for their somberly biographical, yet still expectedly off-kilter, lyrics of grief and memory. Refreshingly light on self-seriousness, as the title likely gave away, Angst still manages to move. That upbeat exclamation, the kind of thing you imagine a Hegel professor yelling at his undergraduates, is dead right as a descriptor of Fleischmann's own musical bent. Since 2000's A Choir of Empty Beds, he has commanded a broad emotional palette absent in the ominous monotony and thoughtlessly turgid textures of that whole generation of cookie-cutter Aphex Twin copycats. All the way up to this most recent release, recorded in the wake of a friend's death, Fleischmann's subtly uplifting tunes have never lost the through-line of melancholy that winds back to his Morr Music debut, Pop Loops for Breakfast. Angst continues that upward curve of building complexity and nuance, owing no small debt to the chorus of new, colorful, delicate voices that, to take a phrase from his closing song, fill up Fleischmann's castles of memory.","Even while recording in the wake of a friend's death, this Morr mainstay's complex, nuanced tunes don't lose their subtle uplift.

Kaleidoscopic,Lars Horntveth,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d013d1975652138957/1:1/w_160/11e3d995.jpeg,2009-03-12 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12762-kaleidoscopic/,Smalltown Supersound,"Post-rock is stuffed with overrated albums, so it's extra-exciting to find an underrated one, like Jaga Jazzist's What We Must . Its flirtation with smooth jazz is the probable sticking point. Fey reed instruments are laden with uncool associations-- it's all good to graft some severe classical strings to your rock music, but heads turn when you start fucking with Kenny G. Even their name downplays the fact that they're a rock band (understandably-- ""Jaga Rockist"" is problematic). It's too bad, because What We Must brims with indelible melodies set in muscular rhythms: the lively, interlocking motifs so much post-rock forsakes for morose blears. If Jaga Jazzist excels at weaving together striking set pieces, Kaleidoscopic insinuates that Lars Horntveth is the band's driving force. In this 37-minute composition, his sprightly themes seem like glass cases in a museum, both self-contained and part of a greater narrative. At the beginning of the piece, Horntveth returns to a cunning device used on Jaga songs like ""All I Know is Tonight"": By setting an eerie lead melody against a quiet shimmer, he makes it contort gracefully in an isolated field. Then come the piles of gushy strings (the orchestra contains 34 string players), the glinting harps, the sly pizzicato sub-rhythms, the unfurling brass, and coiled woodwinds. On the whole, it suggests Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf minus the Boris Karloff narration: jaunty, temperate, and willfully naïve. It improves upon Horntveth's solo debut, Pooka, by desegregating his instrumentals, making them talk to each other. Kaleidoscopic occupies the ambiguous region between classical and pop/indie-- the same one occupied by Horntveth's stated influences, including Joanna Newsom, Robert Wyatt, Stereolab, and Jean-Claude Vannier. On one hand, it was recorded in a small church in Riga with 41 members of the Latvian National Orchestra (Horntveth himself plays piano, clarinet, and horns) and conducted by Terje Mikkelsen of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic and the Moscow Radio Orchestra. On the other, it isn't grounded in any cultural meta-narrative or musicological doctrine. Instead, it takes up that indie-est of subjects: his emotions. Horntveth has said that Kaleidoscopic sought to document his evolving state of mind, which sounds like a fancy way of saying that he wrote whatever he felt like writing and then knitted it together. In the same year when Arvo Pärt addresses himself to the book of John (on his new release, In Principio), Horntveth takes up the book of Lars. The self is the new culture. This explains the album's roundabout, intuitive progression, and gives one the impression that Horntveth is a pretty sanguine guy. Only the mildly menacing piano of the middle section disturbs the beatific mood, which is rather refreshing at a time when menace's currency seems drastically inflated. For the most part, the album wavers between pensive happiness and outright ecstasy-- a tingly shine constantly attends it, like the air just above a glass of something highly carbonated. If this makes Kaleidoscopic sound a bit lightweight, that's because it is-- a charming, unapologetically frothy bagatelle, more concerned with spontaneous inspiration than formal rigor. But I had the pleasure of seeing its premiere performance at Oslo's Øya Festival last summer and can attest that the skill of the players belies the lack of ambition Horntveth's vague thematic content might imply. In fact, this ambiguity-- this tinge of slackness and self-obsession-- might make it the consummate indie-symphony: navel-gazing, capricious, influence-heavy, and broadly accessible.","The leader of underrated post-rock combo Jaga Jazzist follows Joanna Newsom or Robert Wyatt by occupying the ambiguous region between classical music and pop.

Just Like Heaven: A Tribute to the Cure / Perfect as Cats: A Tribute to the Cure,Various Artists,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d5b1335d7bf16985a3/1:1/w_160/3f1c0b99.jpg,2009-03-12 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12766-just-like-heaven-a-tribute-to-the-cure-perfect-as-cats-a-tribute-to-the-cure/,Manimal Vinyl,"While you're scrolling through your mental Rolodex trying to remember the last tribute record you actually liked, realize that the Cure are still a pretty damn fine candidate for the Various Artists treatment. Perhaps three discs released almost concurrently is a bit much but the Cure's discography is deep, complex, and, most importantly, erratic enough to give Just Like Heaven and Perfect As Cats a chance. You could pay tribute to just how much ground the group has covered from their spiky, spooky post-punk origins to their current status as revered figureheads of nearly all forms of alternative rock, or you could stick to a single style that emphasizes the strength of the songwriting. The participants could show their devotion by digging through the vaults for lost treasures or they could try to find a new angle in their more popular canon. But Just Like Heaven chooses the latter for both and does nobody any favors, especially the listener. It's jammed with enough Nick and Norah-styled bands to make Dark Was the Night come off like the Judgment Night OST-- you know the drill: cutesy band name, mussy, bored-sounding guy, mousy, bored-sounding girl, lots of childish synths, and the burden of waking up every day knowing damn well ""Young Folks"" will totally pwn anything they ever come up with. And of course, they're going to pick the sort of songs that the Cure just kept on the right side of embarrassing, the kind that you might have viewed as gospel in your hormonally challenging teen years that their cloying, lustless approach will completely ruin for you. In other words, don't expect ""Shake Dog Shake"" or ""One Hundred Years"" here. At least you're tuned in to how bad things are going to be from the first second. How much does Robert Smith convey in just the first line of ""Just Like Heaven""? But Joy Zipper can't be bothered: Instead of evoking the desperation and dire, wrist-slashing romance of the original, they conjure the self-satisfied smugness of every couple you hate in an insultingly flat and tuneless performance. Tanya Donelly and Dylan in the Movies' (teasingly, ""Tanya Donelly and Dylan..."" on your iPod) mismatched voices prepare ""The Lovecats"" for a cross-species CGI love story yet to be made. While Robert Smith has claimed that ""Friday, I'm In Love"" is a Cure song for people who don't usually like the Cure, there's an undeniable uplift in the chorus lauding the possibilities that the weekend can bring to even the most harried of us. The way it's handled by Dean & Britta, you'd think it was called, ""Friday, So What Do You Want to Do Tonight? I Dunno, What Do You Wanna Do?"" And did you know that there was a shitty mall-punk song dying to get out of ""In Between Days""? If so, then you'll hear what Kitty Karlyle heard when they left the studio. How hard could this be? Take an emo sensibility, slow down some Cure songs and add a layer of updated studio trickery and boom, you have the coordinates for Jimmy Eat World's increasingly prophetic Clarity. But Luff and the Submarines pick the wrong tunes for the job-- though both classics, ""Jumping Someone Else's Train"" and ""Boys Don't Cry"" are more powered by the vigor of their streamlined arrangements than the depth of the lyircs. Here, they're lugged at a slowcore pace and are exposed as sonambulent bitch sessions. At the very least, ""The Walk"" is done justice by the Rosebuds-- not surprising since that very song pretty much invented their Night of the Furies-- and Elk City turns ""Close to Me"" inside out to a sprawling, percussive clatter. (Though it still falls short of Kaki King's understated virtuosity on the Perfect as Cats version.) And unlike Perfect as Cats, this isn't even for charity. It's not every day where a 2xLP tribute is a favorable alternative to anything, but Perfect as Cats immediately trumps Just Like Heaven with generally more inspired song selections and a greater level of talent...or at the very least, more recognizable talent, though it doesn't stop relative headliners the Dandy Warhols from making a typically bored walk-through of ""Primary"". Xu Xu Fang take ""Fascination Street"" on a trip through Massive Attack's Mezzanine, with static crackle, flutes, and a portentous tom beat inverting the sentiment from wide-eyed wonder to heavy-lidded menace. Credit Bat For Lashes for skillfully retaining the grayscale psychedlia of ""A Forest"" without turning it into trip-hop. But the people who put together Perfect as Cats seem to be acknowledging the ridiculously remote possibility that anyone could want to listen to this 33-song platter end-to-end and ignore anything that could pass for smart sequencing or pacing. Witness putting two versions of ""The Walk"" back-to-back, the first in which Indian Jewelry takes it under the Knife with clamorous steel drums and general awfulness. The next is Geneva Jacuzzi's near perfect facsimile, right down to the lead synth tone. Strangely, it suggests the trajectory for the rest of the affair, where the more satisfying numbers are either straight covers or complete about-faces. The Muslims (now the Soft Pack) wisely resist ""Killing an Arab"" and instead apply their no-bullshit garage rock to ""Grinding Halt"", while ""In Between Days"" is stripped down to a Three Imaginary Boys chassis by Blackblack. On the other side, Jesu stretch out ""The Funeral Party"" to post-rock infinity, Joker's Daughter does the inevitable J-Pop twist on ""Kyoto Song"" and ""Hot, Hot, Hot"" is given a salacious en francais treatment by Les Bicylettes Blanches. But even after all of that, it must be stressed that the vast majority just proves how many bands you've never heard of can pull off perfectly good imitations of Robert Smith (Rainbow Arabia, Wolfkin, Buddy, the Corridor and Ex Reverie, stand up and be counted!) and yet somehow still miss the point that these things should at least try to be entertaining. I'd hate to suggest that fame is correlative to great music, but in this realm, maybe that's the case. You want to hear a familiar act taken out of their comfort zone or a song doing the same. Here, it's just Amateur Hour three times over proving that the Cure were better than anyone at doing what they do. But at least everyone could've waited until Disintegration was out of print.","Did you want three discs' worth of Cure tribute material? Too late.

Face Control,Handsome Furs,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a323b1335d7bf1698667/1:1/w_160/4fc11034.jpg,2009-03-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12827-face-control/,Sub Pop,"The trouble with Plague Park, the 2007 debut LP from the then-betrothed duo Handsome Furs, was that it never sounded like anything but a side project. And I suppose it was; chances are, if you know Handsomer Fur Dan Boeckner, you know him as co-marshal of Wolf Parade. More than that, though, Plague Park was far too long on mood and entirely too spare with the nervy buildups and outsized choruses Boeckner's provided to his parent band's records. What Plague lacked in focus it made up in atmosphere and the odd killer hook, but it was an oddly dispassionate album for a couple of young lovers, and it did little more than make one wish Wolf Parade would get on with it already. In the couple of years since Plague Park, Wolf Parade issued the intriguing but ultimately underwhelming At Mount Zoomer and Boeckner got himself properly hitched to Alexei Perry, also his partner in Handsome Furs. The two found a little time in between merging their checking accounts and posing for increasingly salacious press photos to craft Face Control, and boy, the sound committed now. On every conceivable level down to the cover art, Face Control bests its predecessor, adding stuttering nuance to their previously too-spare sound, which they drape over some of the finest songs Boeckner's ever written. The Furs' greatest songwriting strength is their ability to imbue a select line or two with a terrific amount of meaning; even when said line could easily turn cliché in less able hands. Boeckner's proven this time and again with Wolf Parade-- ""This Heart's on Fire"" ain't exactly a new thought, but a helluva chorus-- and it's a skill the Furs used all too sparingly on Plague Park. ""All We Want, Baby, Is Everything"" isn't just the title of Face Control's best song; it's the text of the entire hook, and, really, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot just sitting there on the page. To hear Boeckner sing it, though-- especially over the effortlessly exultant chiming provided by he and Perry-- you'd swear you knew just what he was on about. Lyrical inscrutability peppered with the occasional waft of clarity has always been a Boeckner trademark, and Face Control continues that. Disaffection, if not necessarily rage, seems to be directed at the machine this time but Boeckner's well-hewn vocal affectations and the album's sleek, spare veneer lend its lines a palpable sense of dread. There are a few tunes that reference Russia in one way or another, which, coupled with the album's oft-synthetic Glasnost-era sonics, at times suggest a particularly Cold War-borne paranoia, but it's not quite so clear as that; Boeckner and Perry keep their words open enough to invite interpretation without resorting to either nonsense or platitudes, and these easily applicable feelings of dread seem like a good fit for these strange times we find ourselves in. Fittingly, Face Control is just more than a little addled, due in no small part to the inspired synth work of Ms. Perry and an increased focus on the eerie snap of their drum machine. Where keyboards would float by on Plague Park, they splatter and stain on Face Control, finding the sweet spot between the clattering underpinning and Boeckner's sturdy, sometimes searing guitar. Though they pepper the mix with a lot more stuff this time around, there's a spare, dubby quality to most of the record that smacks of fellow minimalists Spoon. All the more appropriate a setting for allowing Boeckner's impressionistic verses and revelatory choruses to rattle around in your head, I'd say. Sure, not every song hits quite as hard as the New Order-referencing ""All We Want"" or the terrific closing twofer ""Thy Will Be Done"" and ""Radio Kaliningrad"", and ""Nyet Spasiba"" shares a bit too much with ""All We Want"" to be sequenced quite so close together on the disc. Small quibbles, though. What's clear is that Boeckner and Perry ought not break that embrace they're so often captured in; they're clearly a match made in weirdo heaven, and we're nearly as lucky to have them making strange, sumptuous records like Face Control as they appear to be to have each other.","On every conceivable level-- even down to the cover art-- the new LP from Wolf Parade-related Handsome Furs bests its predecessor.

Drone Trailer,MV & EE,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b2c0084474cd0c00d5/1:1/w_160/2149933e.jpeg,2009-03-11 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12737-drone-trailer/,Dicristina,"The freak-folk universe has two major poles. One is represented by the Jewelled Antler collective, the San Francisco wing of the operation. The other surrounds Vermont's Matthew Valentine, who rose to a kind of prominence as Tower Recordings, and more recently plays as MV & EE with his partner Erika Elder. Of course, there is plenty more to this freewheeling, loosely defined scene. And, at his best, Valentine embodies everything that marked freak folk as a promising path for American musicians looking to place a woodsy focus on acoustic sounds, whether Western banjos or Eastern tablas. The new record breaks rank. Drone Trailer arrives-- after numerous CD-Rs and tapes of cross-cultural, relentlessly unconventional music to stargaze by-- bearing principally unthreatening, old-fashioned rock'n'roll. A curveball of cosmic proportions, ""Anyway"" opens the record, muscling through with fuzzy, hard-rock riffs. The cataract of distortion overpowers Erika Elder's singing, leaving audible only the enigmatic question, ""Hey spaceman, hey spaceman/ Whatever happened to the master plan?"" Valentine repeats, ""Anyway I can"" from across the room, a gentle faraway presence that sounds spectral and disembodied. Turning around completely, ""The Hungry Stones"" finds Valentine channeling Neil Young circa Sugar Mountain. A surprising juxtaposition of close-up harmonica and distant distortions amplifies the melancholic singing and nostalgic-stoner lyrics. The sleepy vocals and daydream guitars on the 10-minute ""Weatherhead Hollow"" and ""Huna Cosm"" verge on slowcore, a sort of bucolic Low. The title track suggests a Deep South-meets-the-Subcontinent fantasia, in the soupy swirling together of Doc Dunn's curving pedal steel, Valentine's bantar, and Elder's anesthetized, steel-magnolia delivery. A fitting summation of a batshit philosophy that, on Drone Trailer, goes down easier as straight-ahead rock.","Matthew Valentine, who rose to a kind of freak-folk prominence as Tower Recordings, returns with partner Erika Elder.

Communion,Soundtrack of Our Lives,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b1ea9e61561daa4ae7/1:1/w_160/44743f61.jpeg,2009-03-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12736-communion/,Yep Roc,"It takes some balls to release a double album in this day and age, when most acts can barely muster the resources for a single disc. Then again, when you're a moderately successful but still mostly under the radar Swedish rock act with fondness for bands that made excess a big part of their art, perhaps it's more of a mystery why you don't release double-albums more often. Indeed, the well of maximum R&B from which the Soundtrack of Our Lives draw will never run dry. And that doesn't even take into account all the things the group can do to its 1960s psych and classic rock influences by filtering them through the subsequent forty-plus years of musical progress (not that the band has ever tried terribly hard to bring its rocking retreads ""up to date""). Yet a double album today is a much more demanding proposition than it was in the time of Quadrophenia. The two discs of Communion , the Soundtrack of Our Lives' fifth full-length (with the emphasis on ""full""), runs a total of a whopping hour and a half. To put that in classic rock perspective, that's about ten minutes longer than the aforementioned epic by the Who, which both had the advantage of a) a plot; and b) the band's already substantial iconic legacy. Communion may not have a plot but it may, however loosely, have a concept, either one song for every hour of the day, or maybe even that old standby, a meditation on ""the state of the world."" Regardless, meaning isn't nearly as important here as execution, and to that end the band has easily come up with its best set of songs since its sort-of 2001 breakthrough Behind the Music. If not every track on the set is a winner, neither are there any outright stinkers. And then there's the added bonus that rarely does the album sound nearly as belabored as, say, Oasis, a band with which TSOOL's shares a certain dubiously defiant rockist mentality. Unlike the oppressively self-conscious Oasis, however, there's a real joy driving the Soundtrack to Our Lives. And the result is an album that embraces both the bluster and the grandeur of past high-watermarks of portent with a refreshing lack of both irony and cynicism. It's this vital distinction that helps songs such as ""Babel On"", ""Ra 88"", ""Mensa's Marauders"", or the Faces-y ""Thrill Me"" kick into gear, or the band's unexpected remake Nick Drake's ""Fly"" take off in the mold of early Who (much as the Byrds similarly adopted so many Dylan songs as their own). And that's just the first half. The slightly gentler second disc brings about a sigh of relief when the opener ""Everything Beautiful Must Die"" begins to solidify to suspicion that, hey, maybe the band will actually pull this thing off. It's a feeling ratified by songs such as ""Flipside"", the pretty instrumental ""Digitarian Riverbank"" and equally lovely ""Lifeline"", the stomp (but not obnoxious swagger) of ""Reconnecting the Dots"", and the Eastern-tinged ""Utopia"". After all those songs and all that time, a lesser band might have finally given in to the urge and ended the album on the most over-the-top climax possible. But Communion ends instead with the pleasingly restrained conclusion ""The Passover"", by which time the Soundtrack of Our Lives have pulled off the rarest of victories: bombast minus the abuse.","Sweden's unabashed retro rockers release a 24-song 2xCD album.

The B.C.

That's not an altogether uncommon occurrence, but it usually doesn't happen with stuff I downloaded for free online. Free downloadable rap usually means mixtapes with shitty sound-quality and obligatory obnoxious yelled DJ ad-libs. It doesn't usually mean lush, full-bodied Southern slow-creep stuff, well-recorded music that gives itself some room to breathe. That The B.C. Era sounds so good speaks to Bobby Creekwater's situation. He's one of the token Southern rappers on Shady/Aftermath, which, thanks to the almighty Dre/Eminem/50 triumvirate, is maybe the single most successful rap label ever. But these days, Dre and Eminem can't get it together to release their own albums, let alone those of their talented underlings. And so Bobby Creekwater remains in some moneyed limbo: not starving, not anxious, but not able to get his stuff heard unless he releases it directly to the internet. Which he did. * The B.C. Era* only barely qualifies as an EP; at nine songs and 30 minutes, it's practically as long as Illmatic. That's long enough that it gives us a strong idea of Creekwater's aesthetic sense and short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome. The production comes either from Creekwater himself or from unknown associates like D. Focis. That's a red flag, but this thing sounds great. The beats are so expansive and intricate that at times they almost become oppressive. Organs blare, horns bleat, drums explode. But it's never intense; all of this music unfolds at a lazy crawl, sunny and elegiac at the same time. This is car music, not club music, and we rarely hear this sort of warm thump anymore. It's Southern rap in the organic, bluesy mid-90s Dungeon Family/8Ball & MJG tradition, not the Casio bloops that dominate the market now. And the one exception, the skeletal bass-heavy knock of ""When I Go"", recalls an even older age without simply recreating it. Most rappers would try to yell over beats this grandly all-consuming just to be heard, but that's not Bobby's style. His rapping voice is slow and deliberate but also expressive and melodic, somewhere on the continuum between Young Bleed's flat mutter and T.I.'s melodic twang. And so he inhabits these tracks, sinking into them rather than popping off them. Even his boasts are smaller-than-life, conversational everydude shit-talk rather than transcendent ghetto-superhero noise: ""I see you niggas on that rap rap rap/ Shit, you need to be filling out a app app app."" When he talks about his money, it's on a small, approachable level: ""I'm not the early bird but I'm fashionably late, mayne/ Convertibles made me hate rain."" If he was talking about his Learjet, I'd call bullshit, but yeah, I can believe he could afford a convertible. Creekwater never mentions Eminem or Dr. Dre by name, but his situation does come up incidentally a couple of times. ""Shady Records, name a label we ain't outsold,"" he says, which is cute but sort of sad, since Bobby Creekwater himself has sold basically no records. And even if his label boss wasn't off in a Vicodin stupor somewhere, Creekwater would have a tough time being heard. These are lean times for intimate, small-stakes rap like this, and it's a shame that he had to dump all this onto the internet for free. But be glad he did. He didn't have to or anything.","Southern rapper loosely affiliated with Eminem and Dre has to release his music for free online.

As Seen Through Windows,Bell Orchestre,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a319c0084474cd0c01cf/1:1/w_160/555f37eb.jpg,2009-03-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12820-as-seen-through-windows/,Arts & Crafts,"Bell Orchestre released their debut full-length, Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light, in 2005, which was both good and bad timing. At the time, Montreal's music scene was holding Stateside listeners in thrall, with legions of talented and energetic multi-instrumentalists crafting classically trained bombast. Bell Orchestre's more abstract Recording a Tape, an entirely instrumental work, received a deservedly high profile but was perhaps unjustly viewed through the same lens. That's because the Orchestre essentially exists as a nexus, a connector of things. They're baroque pop without the pop, post-rock without (most of) the rock. The works on As Seen Through Windows might be called ""neo-classical,"" except to a classical listener they sound cacophonous: Opener ""Stripes"" is an orchestral take on Neu!, or maybe just an orchestral warm-up set to an insistent motorik beat. But for the group's proud no-synths policy, the brass lead could just as easily have been conceived as a Minimoog from the progressive 1970s. The analog sound comes in part from producer John McEntire. Under the Tortoise leader's helm, the Orchestre seems to have nudged a bit over into jazzy vibraphone ambiance. The rhythmic complexity and duration of songs has increased, but even the tracks ranging north of eight minutes flow with the easily parsed dynamics of three-minute works. The ""Arcade Fire thing"" is still relevant (violinist Sarah Neufeld and redheaded Napoleon Dynamite doppelganger Richard Parry are full-time BO members)-- the group engages in the same happy onslaughts as their better known contemporaries. Yet whereas Arcade Fire engage the listener in personal and political appeals, Bell Orchestre offer impressionistic narratives of the world around them. For example, ""Elephants"" actually features brass recalling a pachyderm call, accompanied by string screeches sounding like wayward seabirds. In lieu of actual vocals, lyricism is derived from the character of a French horn, the tenor of a violin's hurried bow, the Dave Fridmann-esque drum stampede. The work evokes a scene rather than a style, asking the listener to reconstruct veldt and seaside imagery in the context of (at least loosely) a rock song. Granted, some of this may seem similar to the overly conceptual work of post-rock forebears like McEntire's Tortoise. It might seem pedantic, but the over-referenced Arcade Fire thing is actually the best rebuttal. Orchestre, like many dedicated post-rock artists, are themselves critics, triangulating the state of rock music by abstractly recasting it according to their own training. But they're also editors, often juxtaposing subtle hints of their own influences with energy, subtlety, and originality. Take the record's closer: ""Air Lines/Land Lines"" breathes a folksy, almost antebellum charm before engaging a hymnic and jazzy crescendo, then closing by mediating on its original theme. It crystallizes Bell Orchestre as a group whose talented players voraciously consume the world around it and re-channel its varied histories into the works. Windows extends the filmic dynamism and orchestral spark that carried Recording a Tape, but instead of remaining in the background, the narrative-- impressionistic and imperfect-- comes to a often-unpredictable present.","Arcade Fire-related band enlists Tortoise's John McEntire and expands its cinematic scope and orchestration.

Fuckbook,Condo Fucks,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a316b1335d7bf1698647/1:1/w_160/546079a0.jpg,2009-03-11 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12819-fuckbook/,Matador,"Though the youthful exuberance that carried their Condo Fucks City Rockers EP and high water mark Straight Outta Connecticut to modern-classic status during their mid-1990s heyday is now noticeably muted, Fuckbook, the latest LP from New London, Conn., trio the Condo Fucks is nevertheless the veteran band's pinnacle... Oh, what the hell am I on about. Fuckbook is, despite outward appearances, the new record by Yo La Tengo. But the bait-and-switch goes a little deeper than pseudonym, itself a (pretty funny!) dozen-year-old joke from the booklet of the band's 1997 effort I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One. See, Fuckbook is a covers record, even more so than 1990's Fakebook (thus concludes the gag portion of our program). Yo La Tengo touch on about a million things in their music with varying degrees of success; the Condo Fucks, however, only do the one: Fuckbook gathers 11 mostly garage-borne rockers from the likes of the Troggs, Slade, the Kinks, Richard Hell, and others and, from the sound of things, runs 'em all through a shredder. If you've heard a Yo La Tengo record, you've probably heard a Yo La Tengo cover, but rarely if ever like these; so often the band adds its fine-tuned tumble to whatever they interpret, and the results are often reverent and, with some notable exceptions, inessential. But even the least jagged edge of this Fuckbook might give you a papercut. The thing rips-- its closest sonic counterpart is the Stooges' Fun House. You ever think you'd see a sentence like that about a Yo La Tengo record? This gnarly, live-in-a-room sound isn't unprecedented: You could easily cherrypick a dozen similarly scuzzy rockers from the past four or five Yo La Tengo records proper, albeit with a generally higher production standard. But Fuckbook is leaner than a typical Yo La Tengo record in every way: It halves its predecessor's length and triples its volume, resulting in the most cohesive thing they've released since Painful. But while a singularity of purpose hasn't always worked out for Yo La-- see the sleepy The Sounds of the Sounds of Science or the haphazard live-on-air covers set Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics-- Fuckbook's lazer focus makes it  the most immediately enjoyable, endlessly replayable entry in their catalog in some time. Though not all radio hits, these tunes are clearly familiar favorites to the band-- and, since no Yo La Tengo review would be complete without mentioning Ira's tenure as a rock critic, here's that part; to that end, the song selection's pretty impeccable, too. A false start marks the beginning of their opening take on the Small Faces' ""Whatcha Gonna Do About It"", and from there it's on; for the next 30 minutes and change, drums pound, guitars spill every which way, and a few voices you might recognize bleat out a tune or two you know by heart. Though they gleefully slop up every song here, quite a few stay close to their source material in tempo and timbre. For most bands, playing it that close to the hip would earn them a mark in the bad column, but even on the most reverent cover here-- the Georgia-sung ""With a Girl Like You""-- they sound like they're having a blast, like something like this was just what they needed. When they start to veer off the beaten path, Fuckbook really gets going. Their take on the Flamin' Groovies' ""Dog Meat"" actually manages to bring out the surfy central riff even further to the forefront, and James McNew's vocals throughout the disc-- and on their closing cover of Slade's ""Gudbuy T'Jane"" especially-- are a perfect fit with the material. Ira, a supremely underrated guitarist, gets his best showcase in forever here, and Georgia's as rock solid as ever behind the kit. She and Ira still aren't the most natural singers for this particular stripe of rock'n'roll, but their willingness to go for it adds a lot of Fuckbook's appeal. And, frankly, because the whole thing's so out of character, a lot of the charm of these somewhat unlikely lo-fi heroes-- who, even with Times New Viking, Fucked Up, and Sonic Youth as labelmates might be the single skronkiest band current signed to Matador-- lies in the fact that they just up and did this thing without provocation, and it worked. Sure, it's a covers record and a fairly unambitious one at that, unless ""being confusing"" and ""being loud"" are ambitions. And maybe for Yo La Tengo, they oughta be; as much as I'm looking forward to the next one from Ira, Georgia, and James proper, it's gonna have to work awfully hard to match the effortless blast that is Fuckbook.","Despite outward appearances, this is the new covers record from indie rock legends Yo La Tengo.
