Grey-Eyed Girls,The Fresh & Onlys,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a651ea9e61561daa5339/1:1/w_160/d2b1ad65.jpg,2009-10-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13507-grey-eyed-girls/,Woodsist,"The Fresh & Onlys formed just last year in San Francisco, but they already boast more music to their name than most bands manage in twice that time. Over the course of a flurry of 7""s, a limited-edition cassette, and two full-length albums-- last spring's self-titled and now Grey-Eyed Girls-- you can hear the sound of a young band busily honing in on what they're good at. In case you weren't tipped off by their almost distractingly evocative band name (should we be thinking of the Only Ones, or the Young Fresh Fellows?), the Fresh & Onlys traffic in jangly garage-pop, balancing psych-rock swagger with generous dollops of sweetly cockeyed melody. Their recordings are lovingly caked with crud, and their jams sometimes veer perilously close to derailing completely*,* which might seem to lump them in with other San Francisco psych revivalists like Thee Oh Sees and Sic Alps. But the Fresh & Onlys are set apart by an endearingly fussy devotion to songcraft and an understated and unfakeable weirdness. Their self-titled record was fairly straightforward but satisfying garage rock; Grey-Eyed Girls is stranger and more interesting, toning down the swagger and finding a sweet spot somewhere in between uptempo brashness and the quirky vulnerability of Beat Happening. If the Fresh & Onlys come off as more winsome than your average Nuggets fetishists, part of that might have something to do with their diffident rhythm section, which ensures that they wobble more often than they rock. ""What's His Shadow Still Doing Here"" is a classic piece of Buddy Holly yearning that drags and nearly trips over its own feet, gaining in poignancy and charm whatever it loses in a steady backbeat. ""No Second Guessing"", meanwhile, comes off like a handmade valentine straight from Calvin Johnson: ""Be strong, be wise/ Don't ever question your place in my life,"" Tim Cohen warbles in his unsteady baritone. ""Dude's Got a Tender Heart"", for its part, is a bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold tale that echoes the Crystals' ""He's a Rebel"" over a tin-can approximation of girl-group pop: ""You wouldn't know if you looked at him/ But dude's got a tender heart."" There are a handful of killer straight-ahead rave-ups as well: The spectacularly catchy ""I'm Gonna Be Your Elevator"" bops along on its ""I'm gonna lift you up/ I'm gonna bring you down"" chorus chant, while ""D.Y."" supplies the Yardbirds-style barn-burner. But the most intriguing numbers branch out into more wigged-out territory, like the B-movie paranoia of ""Invisible Forces"" or ""Clowns (Took My Baby Away)"", the title of which requires no further elucidation. These little weirdo touches help distinguish the Fresh & Onlys from their San Francisco brethren*,* and throughout Grey-Eyed Girls, their possibly unhealthy familiarity with garage-rock arcana is balanced out by a keen songwriter's eye, and their obsession with the past is elevated by genuine affection and love.","Prolific Bay Area band offers its latest album of jangly garage-pop, balancing psych-rock swagger with generous dollops of sweetly cockeyed melody.

Keep in Mind Frankenstein,Grand Archives,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6acc0084474cd0c0a00/1:1/w_160/7cf0a570.jpg,2009-10-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13587-keep-in-mind-frankenstein/,Sub Pop,"On their highly enjoyable 2008 debut, Grand Archives passed a very, very narrow test: They integrated rootsy influences from both the PacNW indie and Southern country to honor the Band of Horses connection (singer Mat Brooke is an alumnus), but by leaning towards the AM gold side of the dial, they managed to avoid being redundant. Now Grand Archives aim to make a record that can be defined on its own terms. The resulting disc, Keep in Mind Frankenstein, arguably does a good job of establishing a more singular sound for the band, but I'm not so sure their confidence is applied to the right things. Brooke's voice is nice enough, sort of like a Listerine breath strip-- oddly sweet, papery, and prone to dissolving on contact. On Grand Archives, it proved capable of delivering loopy but ingratiating melodies while exploring some of Sub Pop's more welcoming artistic avenues. Frankenstein occasionally reprises what made its predecessor successful-- ""Oslo Novelist"" and ""Left for All the Strays"" play like folky, half-speed power pop with tightly-strung acoustic chords, trebly leads, and Brooke's corkscrewing vocal lines. But as the tempos slog and the hooks soften in the service of a more uniform mood, those moments feel like brief respites of vigor amidst a record whose pacing feels awfully pokey for something that's barely over a half-hour long. Whatever menace gets conveyed in the repetitious invocation, ""Someday I will come back,"" from ""Topsy's Revenge"" is overshadowed by a weary arrangement, little more than plinking acoustic strums in a dragging tempo. ""Witchy Park/Tomorrow Will (Take Care of Itself)"" builds to a cyclical, beautifully melancholy refrain but takes about two minutes too many to rustle itself out of slumber, and with the exception of the aforementioned and ""Dig That Crazy Grave""'s blocky percussion, most of Frankenstein just kinda sails by you. Barely-there, near-instrumentals like ""Siren Echo Valley, Pt. 1"" and ""Willoughby"" (as well as actual instrumentals like ""Siren Echo Valley, Pt. 2"") try to turn Brooke and Sera Cahoone's harmonies into load-bearing instruments, but they're neither strong enough harmonically nor interesting enough texturally to feel spare as opposed to merely underwritten. Maybe we all should've just been careful about what we wished for: For all the adulation accrued by Grand Archives, I can't remember too many people being particularly high on ""The Crime Window"" or ""Breezy No Breezy"", the former sticking out as a gung-ho shoutalong, the latter for being a Calexico-ish curiosity. Lo and behold, either of those are what's missing from Frankenstein-- I'd hate to think that founding member Ron Lewis bolted for the Shins because he thought they'd be more attuned to the quirks and rawk he may have brought to the table. It's far from a bad record and fits the bill for the pace of a hungover Sunday. But while hangovers tend to be glorified somewhat as of late, it's worth noting that, most of the time, you're just listlessly waiting for them to pass.","Ex-Band of Horses memberÂ Mat Brooke and co. follow their highly enjoyable debut with their latest Sub Pop release.

Break It Up,Jemina Pearl,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c85e6ef95969320e0b/1:1/w_160/65c0e369.jpg,2009-10-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13611-break-it-up/,Ecstatic Peace,"""Drug runs and beer busts, it's all I know/ I don't wanna grow up and have to let go,"" barked Jemina Pearl on Be Your Own Pet's second and final LP, Get Awkward. ""I feel the pressure to change my ways/ All I see are more dark days."" By definition, BYOP was a fleeting endeavor-- a band of fuck-off teens destined to flame out rather than linger on. They wrote songs about food fights, robbing banks, and, like, adventuring; when Pearl declared, ""We ride bikes, cars are for idiots,"" narrow side lanes turned into unfuckwithable alleys of cool. To BYOP, concerns about contentment, love, and mortality were laugh lines. They even turned typical punk rebellion into a cartoon farce. ""Next year I'll be 21/ So look out, world, 'cause I wanna have fun,"" sang Pearl on BYOP's ""Super Soaked"". Now 22, Pearl's name is front and center on Break It Up, her solo bow recorded with BYOP drummer John Eatherly. The zombies and pizza parties of yore are replaced with predicted ""dark days,"" though this Brooklyn by-way-of Nashville badass is still thrashing against maturity as best as she can. Case in point, here's the singer describing a recent altercation with a fan: ""dude fucked up during the last song by flicking lit cigarettes at me. not cool. i kicked his ass, there was blood, and everyone at the show cheered because he sucked."" In Pearl's world, there's black and white-- and maybe some red. Things that suck get what they deserve, whether they're asshole fans, jerky boyfriends, or simply the notion of growing up. She's an old-school punk in that there's little pretense; she thrashes about onstage because she wants to and not because she thinks it looks cool. According to her Ecstatic Peace label head (and Break It Up guest guitarist/vocalist) Thurston Moore, she's not ""out to impress anybody; she [is] just kicking total ass."" He should know. As far as ass-kicking goes, there's plenty of it here. Nearly every song is marked with a rough-edged riff from another era, whether it be surf, garage, or girl group. And Pearl's guttural wail is intact. But there are no straight-up, minute-long goofs, and instead of raging on about pitch-perfect nonsense and suburban malaise, Pearl often turns inward. The self-reflection can be reassuring, as on the fizzy, Dave Sitek-assisted Gemini ode ""Ecstatic Appeal"", or deeply troubling, as on the laborious downer ""Retrograde"", where voices in the back of Pearl's mind tell her to ""go on, cut a little bit deeper, see how far we can go."" The LP's best reflective track finds a semi-happy middle ground between those two extremes; ""No Good"" has the singer lambasting herself for being lazy-- ""I've been trying for so long, can't get shit done""-- with the song acting as a fitful solution to the idleness. Break It Up isn't all introspection set to a Stooges beat-- there are still some hell-raiser cartoons. ""Looking for Trouble"" starts off with a classic rock'n'roll quotable (""Never sold my soul to the devil/ Gave it away for free"") but its troublemaker shtick is a little tired-- even Pearl sounds edgeless, as if she's bored with being bad. Better is ""I Hate People"", a knowing caricature co-starring Iggy Pop in full-on crooner mode. ""I hate people, and you do too,"" they sing, relishing their mutual loathing while a pepped-up Motown back beat adds another wink. Faced with a child star's dilemma of symbolizing infinite irresponsibility, Pearl dips into adulthood admirably on Break It Up. Her frankness makes the record a difficult proposition-- if she continued to shirk and joke like she was 17, it would be dishonest; turning in a collection of mid-tempo songs about twentysomething angst would negate everything she's done leading up to this point. The record never takes a breather, though you get the feeling it's only a matter of time before she attempts her own ""Maps"". And she'll still make you bleed if the mood strikes her. But the breakup of Pearl's old band has seemingly given her a taste of finality. Even a speck of nostalgia turns up on the wistful, winning ""Nashville Shores"". But instead of glossing over the dubiousness of her hometown's seedy watering holes, she highlights all the ""dirty water,"" ""children's cries,"" and ""easy girls"" that make it live. ""Nashville shores, it's all we got,"" she concludes, proudly.","Be Your Own Pet's precocious singer goes solo and grows up a bit, the zombies and pizza parties of yore replaced with predicted ""dark days.""

Other Truths,Do Make Say Think,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b55e6ef95969320ddd/1:1/w_160/dd67db05.jpg,2009-10-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13595-other-truths/,Constellation,"When instrumental rock bands get tapped for soundtracks, it can be kind of a gut-check that tests how a wider audience may view their music. Sigur RÃ³s' folkloric melodrama and emotive language made sense as a backdrop for Vanilla Sky, itself a sort of sci-fi fairytale about misplaced and unrequited love starring someone prone to over-excitement. The charged music of Explosions in the Sky fit the open expanses and crushing blows of Friday Night Lights' take on Texas high school football culture (hell, guitarist Munaf Rayani sometimes bends over his instrument like a lineman crouching down into a three-point stance). So it seemed odd that a track by Canadians Do Make Say Think was chosen for the oil industry drama Syriana. Not to say the Toronto post-rock band doesn't make the kind of mesmerizing music suitable for a film score (or that the more tense, overtly politicized music of Godspeed You! Black Emperor might have been a better fit). But DMST can sound so pastoral-- the music was literally recorded in a barn, in some cases-- it may seem to lack the bite for a blood-for-oil flick. While Do Make Say Think can project a gentle, laid-back vibe-- member Charles Spearin did just finish The Happiness Project-- they're far from spinning their wheels and rehashing post-rock clichÃ©s. Other Truths doesn't roughen up the band's jazz-steeped aesthetic. But it does add more dimensions and sharp textures to their songwriting, which continues to get tighter yet wider in scope. Spread across a suite of four lengthy tracks and titled with the same string of verbs as the band's name, the album isn't about momentum as much as it is about transitions. Opener ""Do"" starts with crisp, intertwined guitar lines playing off one another. As the track morphs and unfurls-- cue the slow-build and crescendo-- the themes reappear more charged, parrying with horns and descending into static. ""Make"" quietly delays the payoff, slowly ratcheting things up and marching toward a climax with a floor of tense bass, echoing chants, and sinewy, stretched string notes. When a warm motif of horns and fuzzed guitars begins to cut through the dread, the song's color noticeably shifts. ""Say"" strikes a grandiose yet road-weary tone, as a lonely slide guitar melody gets echoed and expanded by trumpets and churning drums, while ""Think"" may be its companion and comedown, a slow trail set forth by a quivering, reverb-laden guitar line. Compared to the group's first few albums, filled with echoing melodies reflective of cavernous recording spaces, Other Truths shows Do Make Say Think more adept at sketching out and imagining their own widescreen landscapes. The interplay here is more complex than You, You're a History in Rust, showcasing restraint and more subtle shifts. Calling instrumental rock ""soundtrack music"" might be stating the obvious. But when it manages to sound as composed and calculated as Other Truths, it isn't meant as a slight.","Toronto post-rock band's latest contains four lengthy tracks that add new dimensions and sharper textures to their sound.

Tarot Sport,Fuck Buttons,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ce9d034d5c69bf3626/1:1/w_160/10046cce.jpg,2009-10-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/,ATP,"Like any noise group, Fuck Buttons rely on a certain amount of vulgarity and aggression. While they've always possessed a knack for melody that has, for their genre, provided their music with an accessible edge, listeners unaccustomed to blood-curdling screams and metal-scraping drones have had their work cut out for them when searching for the more delicate moments that helped make last year's Street Horrrsing such a stunning listen. Tarot Sport represents a subtler, more mature approach to songwriting and a sharpening of their craft. But moreso, it marks aÂ comprehensiveÂ stylistic shift for the duo's sound, from experimental noise with a buried pop sensibility to a sort of modernized electronic take on classic post-rock structures. And impressively, they've made these changes without sacrificing any of the genre-straddling adventurousness that made them intriguing in the first place. Perhaps the best way to think about their transformation is to consider how the new material relates to post-rock groups like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The band has always had an inclination toward sweeping epics (see: ""Sweet Love for Planet Earth""), but instead of using scale as a canvas for brutality/delicacy contrasts, here they repurpose the post-rock format as a digital soundscape. Gone are the shrieks and wailing guitar chords that populatedÂ Street Horrrsing; instead these songsÂ are built almost wholly with synth and keyboard textures that originate in dance music. Aiding the shift is producer Andrew Weatherall, whoÂ has a long history of infusing rock with dancefloor bounce and drawing the best from his groups. (HisÂ helming of Primal Scream's epochalÂ Screamadelica and his remix work with My Bloody Valentine are prime examples.) From the chugging drumbeat of opener ""Surf Solar"" to the chipped-up electro backdrop of finale ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"", the dynamics and textures of techno are the foundation of the record, making a direct link between Tarot and Weatherall's earlier boundary-defying productions. All of which is prologue to Tarot Sport's actual songs, which by and large are pretty freaking incredible. There's a cinematic, storytelling quality to the music, and the climactic builds of longer pieces such as ""The Lisbon Maru""-- with itsÂ militaristic drumbeat and huge synth melodies-- conjure the excitement of an oversized movie sequence.Â ""Surf Solar"", extended from the clipped-length radio edit that emerged online last month, is anxious and menacing by comparison but hits those notes without the histrionics of Fuck Buttons' previous work-- the band seems just too confident here to rely on screeches to get its point across. Fuck ButtonsÂ also master shorter pieces that shift and redirect the record's momentum. Close in spirit to the tribal romp of ""Ribs Out"" from Street Horrrsing-- butÂ ultimatelyÂ more listenable and imaginative-- ""Rough Steez"" envisions industrial techno as locomotive skronk. And ""Phantom Limb"" recalls genre-benders like Liquid Liquid and Gang Gang Dance with its cavernous atmosphere and snaky, complex arrangement.Â When the band returns to widescreen emotiveness for the triumphant closer ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"", it feels like a victory lap-- the capper on a record that is a hell of a lot easier to like than even fans of Street Horrrsin**g would have expected.Â That was a great record, but Tarot Sport is a cut above. Perhaps surprisingly, it's also a welcoming album-- and one of the best of this already fruitful year.","The second full-length from this noisy Bristol duo is more accessible than their first but sacrifices none of that record's visceral power.

Barn Nova,MV & EE,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c59d034d5c69bf3606/1:1/w_160/f351318b.jpg,2009-10-22 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13608-barn-nova/,Ecstatic Peace,"After five years and 20-plus albums-- most released on their own Child of Microtones label-- MV & EE's 2006 move to Ecstatic Peace began on a high note. ""East Mountain Joint"", the opening track on Green Blues, is a hypnotic hymn to unscheduled freedom, and it's catchy without losing the duo's loose, do-what-we-feel-like vibe. In fact, it's so entrancing that it's made subsequent work by Matt Valentine, Erika Elder, and their various colleagues seem like insufficient attempts to recapture that magic. There have been beautiful close calls along the way, though, and Barn Nova might be the closest. Like Green Blues, it starts with the strongest material, the kind of songs that cohere without constricting. ""Feelin' Fine"" is like a skeletal version of ""East Mountain Joint"", with a steady shuffle that gives Valentine's ghostly moans a pulse. The swaying ""Get Right Church"" is even better. Here Elder's chants about journeys home and evening trains support a web of overlapping guitars, presumably belonging to Valentine and longtime producer/collaborator J Mascis. Barn Nova doesn't lack strong moments after those early gems, but it wanders too far to appeal to non-diehards. ""Summer Magic"" offers some nice looping guitar from Elder and Mascis, but runs out of ideas about halfway through, merely repeating them for another three minutes. MV & EE's knack for slipping into lackadaisical Neil Young mode emerges on ""Wandering Nomad"", a pleasant, listless amble that's more like Lazy Horse than Crazy Horse. The group floats fully out to sea on ""Bedroom Eyes"", which meanders for what feels like a lot longer than its 11-minute duration. I have a soft spot for this indulgent side of MV & EE-- the side that would rather keep playing, stoned by their own sounds, than stop or change direction just because someone else might get bored. Anyone with similar inclinations-- fans of the lengthy psych of Bardo Pond, the noise jams of Fushitsushsa, the yawning drones of Pelt-- will admire their refusal to sacrifice peaks in order to avoid valleys. But I also doubt that someone with less tolerance would find much exciting about ""Bedroom Eyes"". It would be wrong to make the same claim for the whole of Barn Nova though. It offers a decent amount of accessible folk-rock unencumbered by commercial concerns, and the idea of a perfect MV & EE album is pretty much an oxymoron anyway. Better that they continue to float freely through space, shooting at stars of every size and occasionally connecting squarely with some big ones. This time around, their batting average is good enough that when the all-killer/no-filler MV & EE box set comes along, at least a few tracks from Barn Nova will make the cut.","After nearly a decade of small-run releases,Â Matt Valentine, Erika Elder, and co. bring their act to Thurston Moore'sÂ Ecstatic Peace for a third time.

Doomsday EP,Elvis Perkins in Dearland,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c6b1335d7bf1698ed9/1:1/w_160/48f81f89.jpg,2009-10-22 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13609-doomsday-ep/,XL,"Elvis Perkins knows how to turn lemons into fine lemonade. For a guy who has found himself saddled with ""Next Dylan"" baggage and has enough personal tragedy-turned-backstory to potentially swallow his output, he's continued to hammer away at an increasingly sturdy songbook. Earlier this year, Perkins' second full-length,Â Elvis Perkins in Dearland, found him with a full band at his side, three other guys to propel further his voyages in mortality and universal (though highly personal) woe. Subject matter tended to veer stubbornly towards the dour, but the arrangements were bright, with each song wrapped in warm layers of true blue American sound. Perhaps the record's strongest, no song better exemplifies Perkins' ear for the sublime as ""Doomsday"". It's a brassy, New Orleans-style processional that gains lift with every bass thump and sterling strum, Perkins admitting early on that, yeah, things got pretty grim back there and, yeah, it could stay that way, but screw it. ""I don't let doomsday bother me,"" he sings. ""Do you let it bother you?""Â The song now bookends his new EP of the very same name. But to close, Perkins has refashioned ""Doomsday"" in its original incarnation as an equally soulful, yet much more somber gospel number. The shift in mood works really well sonically, and it also fulfills a bit of listening requirement. This dessert release is a stand-alone six-song exercise in tinkering with the foundations of American music. ""Gypsy Davy"" is a folk standard that Perkins wires up and detonates just before the two-minute mark, adding some squall and the brand of gloom he's come to embody. On the bouncier side, ""Stay Zombie Stay"" is an undead love story you might have copped as a digital bonus track with the aforementioned full-length. Once a strummer, it's now a twangy shuffle as well as lead-in to ""Stop Drop Rock and Roll"", a by-the-numbers roadhouse shakedown that doesn't add much to the conversation even though it both rocks and rolls. ""Weeping Mary"" is truly luminescent, Perkins and his band riffing faithfully on the spiritual. It's not successful because it stirs but because it also showcases just how naturally and elegantly he and this band can sink their teeth into the forms in which they've been nesting. With the exception of the lone cover in ""Gypsy Davy"", Perkins has assembled a small sampling of songs here all with their own very healthy set of bones. And like its twin, the closing undressing of ""Doomsday"" makes for engaging and sumptuous listening. It's one of six looks back, on material both his and tradition's. But it's no step forward. Hopefully that day will come sooner rather than later.","Elvis Perkins punctuates his intriguing In Dreamland LP with aÂ six-song exercise in tinkering with the foundations of American music.

Feel Good Together,Drummer,by: Stephen M.

They wrote some songs in the spring, recorded in the summer, and released their debut in the fall. I'd make a joke about drummers always rushing the beat, but the resulting album, Feel Good Together, sounds remarkably fleshed out, full of smart, focused, propulsive indie art-rock sounds that sound both purposeful and adventuresome. Only one of the full-time drummers kept his day job: Greg Boyd of Ghostman & Sandman sits behind the kit, pounding these songs into shape, and the Black Keys' Patrick Carney rounds out the rhythm section on bass. Steven Clements from the Six Parts Seven plays keyboards like he's opening for ELO; Teeth of the Hydra's Jamie Stillman plays lead guitar like he's been confined to the drum stool for far too long; and Jon Finley of Beaten Awake plays guitar and-- more crucially-- sings like he could have fronted a successful regional metal band 25 years ago. Their shared background as drummers clearly informs the way they approach their new instruments, and Feel Good Together emphasizes fleet rhythms over ornate melodies. On the other hand, their experience in very different groups creates a mix of styles that range from 1970s post-Beatles pop to 90s post-rock to 00s Strokes-y bluster. Despite the band name, the album is a guitar-driven record, relying primarily on Stillman's dexterous fretwork to lead the quintet in and out of geometric jams that sound vaguely prog-metal in origin. He doesn't play lead so much as he pushes rhythm guitar to the forefront, which gives ""Good Golly"" its punishing momentum and ""Connect to Lounge"" its headlong menace. ""Buddy Scapes"" sets mathematical guitar and keyboard riffs against each other at a rapid gallop, as if a ridiculous tempo is as showy as a noodly solo. The pace rarely lags, but even when Drummer slow things down, they never sacrifice magnitude of sound. In fact, the stand-out here is ""Every Nineteen Minutes"", an austerely majestic anthem that ought to make a strong show closer. That song arrives midway through the album, after the precision of Drummer's music threatens to sound a bit mechanical. But Finley's high, tensile vocals add a much-needed human element, especially when he strains to reach certain notes or convey a certain desperation. ""Mature Fantasy"" is his rawest moment, his voice going scratchy as he fights against the attack of guitars. At times the album feels crowded together, as Drummer juggle too many elements or cram songs too full of time changes and tempo switches. ""Summer Control"" in particular seems a bit formless as a closer, working in crunching guitars, quacking synths, and one too many change-ups. Generally, however, Drummer streamline these songs vigorously, as if they're trying to dispel every corny drummer joke all at once.","Black Keys' Patrick Carney leads a band of four other fulltime drummers on this guitar-driven record.

Trapped Animal,The Slits,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b89d034d5c69bf35e2/1:1/w_160/267eb5c7.jpg,2009-10-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13598-trapped-animal/,Narnack,"""The new album is really just another third recorded album. It's just a continuation of the Slits."" That's Ari Up, in a Pitchfork news interview, giving folks a hint on what to expect, or perhaps not expect, from Trapped Animal. Up also told us the Slits were adding dancehall to their burgeoning bag of tricks-- which is to say, some longtime fans who weathered the sea change between Cut's punky reggae party and the murky dubbed-out Return of the Giant Slits might not be following Jamaican music and the Slits into the digital age. But make no mistake, Trapped Animal is, for better or worse, a Slits album-- Mark E. Smith's quip about the Fall being the Fall even if it's just Smith and your granny on the bongos seems to apply here with Ari Up (assuming your granny exchanges her bongos for a melodica). The involvement of original bassist Tessa Pollitt helps make this record's claim to the group's name a little easier to swallow, but it's Ari Up who embodies the group's indomitable je ne sais quoi. And no matter how far these tunes may go astray from what folks recognize as ""Slits tradition,"" Ari does her best to bring these songs back into the fold. Conveniently, the album provides fence-sitting listeners with a like-it-or-lump-it test right at the start. ""Ask Ma"" has Up and friends putting mothers on blast for doing a poor job raising their sons, and for making the Aris of the world have to put up with and clean up after these sorts of men, because even though moms have it tough (since men are keeping them down), ""who's to blame when we get messed-up men?"" If you know of any crypto-feminists desperate for their own ""I Am Woman"", point them in this direction. For your sake, I just hope they're not sticklers for quality rhymes-- the couplet that pairs up ""pick up the pieces"" with ""life's feces"" might be tough for even the most fervent acolyte to stomach. That the music behind such awkward and foggy notions is more than capable only makes these words tougher to bear. This sort of musical/lyrical qualitative disjoint is all over Trapped Animal, with the latter half of the equation usually the guilty party. It's not so much that the album tries to tackle significant issues (like psychological trauma, or the Rastafarian view of Western culture), but that it's torn between actually tackling them head-on or simply playing a two-hand touch. A plodding go-nowhere tune like ""Issues"" suffers because of this indecision, and the less said about the didactic ""history lesson"" offered in the rootsy ""Babylon"", the better. More tunes with an honest sense of perspective, like ""Peer Pressure"", would've been welcome. It also helps that ""Peer Pressure"" features some of the playfulness that brings to mind fond memories of the group's good old days-- Up acts as her own one-woman jungle, acrobatically trilling and cooing as the rest of the group chants ""peer pressure!"" over and over like a playground taunt. Tracks like ""Peer Pressure"" and ""Reject"" manage the difficult trick of being musically Cutting without being warmed-over rehashes of past glories. Sadly, these are the exception more than the rule. The tunes on this record either take an admirable sentiment (like the call to follow your dreams and not the money in ""Pay Rent"") and mushmouth it into a strident polemic, or they just start eating their own foot the minute Ari opens her mouth. An unfortunate example of the latter is ""Reggae Gypsy"", which sounds as advertised, but makes that sound in the most obvious (read: worst) possible way. Of course, the album also includes ""Can't Relate"", a buoyant dubby tune that actually does right by the notion of gypsy-flavored reggae. It's buried on the far end of the album's back half with another highlight, ""Cry"", an unapologetic rock-steady ballad. Given the confused beast that Trapped Animal turned out to be, it seems like the title track's focused on the wrong prisoner, that it's actually the band that's trapped, with the Slits' history and legacy acting as the gilded cage. Returning from nearly two decades of inactivity (barring one spotty EP and a handful of live shows) with a wide-ranging album that further expanded the definition of what the Slits were, while still maintaining fidelity to the infectious and creative fuck-all spirit that fueled the group during its heyday-- in other words, a true continuation-- would've been a welcome, and widely appreciated, statement. Instead, Trapped Animal is nothing more than an odds-and-sods record being passed off as ""business as usual"" by a band that doesn't seem to know what that business is anymore.","The post-punk originals make a long-awaited return, updating their Jamaica/London sound for the digital age.

Logos,Atlas Sound,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d09d034d5c69bf362a/1:1/w_160/697173f8.jpg,2009-10-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13619-logos/,Kranky,"As we've gotten to know Bradford Cox over the last couple of years through shows, interviews, and blog posts, one of the Deerhunter frontman's most appealing qualities is his deep and nuanced appreciation of the music of others. Some musicians listen to records to see how they work, check out the competition, or trawl for ideas; by all available evidence, Cox feels records, deeply. If he was born without musical gifts and couldn't sing or play an instrument, one can imagine him working at a record store, amassing an enviable collection while driving people on a message board crazy with the sureness of his detailed opinions. Whatever you think of his exploits as an indie rock media figure, Cox's music fandom is easy to identify with and also offers a portal into his own work. Atlas Sound, Cox's solo alias, in one sense serves as a sort of laboratory for figuring out what makes some his favorite music tick, away from the expectations of his main band. Two collaborations on Logos, the second Atlas Sound full-length, are excellent examples of how music listening can be absorbed into original work. First is ""Walkabout"", a track Cox wrote and recorded with Noah Lennox from Animal Collective, whom Cox got to know during a European tour. Though Cox's music shades dark and Lennox's is often flecked with uncertainty and doubt, ""Walkabout"" is the sunniest pop tune of either of their careers. Coasting on a buoyant, twinkling keyboard sample, it is a starkly catchy and irresistible, a clattery post-millennial Archies tune that straddles perfectly the border between simple and simplistic. Interestingly, it also sounds very much like a Panda Bear tune. Then there is LÃ¦titia Sadier of Stereolab, who wrote the lyrics and sings lead on Logos' ""Quick Canal"". The song opens with some gorgeously textured organ chords and soon a steady-state beat and drums rise up in the mix, setting the kind of relaxed-but-propulsive neo-krautrock scene that Stereolab perfected very early on. Here Cox gets to play the part of the late Mary Hansen, adding ""la-di-da"" trills behind Sadier as she intones phrases in her unfailingly lovely, for-the-ages voice. He even throws in a ""Jenny Ondioline""-style rupture about halfway through, sending the track into a breathtaking shoegaze section for its final four minutes, wherein it floats magisterially on a pillow of shifting guitar feedback. ""Quick Canal"" is almost nine minutes long and it doesn't waste a second. On these tracks, the confidence Cox shows in melting his aesthetic into the soundworld of other musicians is striking-- both are unqualified successes, very different from each other but among the best things Cox has ever done. But they also sound a lot like the music his collaborators are known for. Cox's sympathetic support and sense of how to construct songs with others suggests a desire to expand the parameters of what Atlas Sound can be. And given his willingness to let others take the microphone on an Atlas Sound project on these cuts, I can't help but go back to Cox's words on Logos before the album was released, which suggested that this was to be less introverted and that was ""not about me."" And then I remember that the cover of the album consists of a photo of Cox with his shirt off and the lyrics in the first two songs start with the word ""I"", which suggests that we probably shouldn't take these statements very seriously. While the songs may or may not be ""about"" Cox in the strictest sense, the overall vibe is at least as introverted as 2008's Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel, and every note bears the same signature. With its strummed guitars, hushed double-tracked vocals, and tunes more reliant on ambiance and feel than melody or rhythm, Logos feels every bit as diaristic and personal, but with Cox, that's a plus. At this point, we're not looking to this guy for commentary on the outside world; we want to hear him wrestle with private demons in the sanctuary of his bedroom, bathing every sound in reverb to give the illusion of space and as a sonic balm against loneliness and figuring out how to make music as affecting as the stuff he loves to listen to. So tracks like ""The Light That Failed"", ""An Orchid"", and ""My Halo"" (the latter two, though different in tone, are further entries in Cox's growing line of melancholy waltz-time shuffles) function primarily as the kind of eerie, blown-out mood music he has become very good at. They are amorphous sketches that still manage to convey feeling, capturing the sort of sad, exhausted, and fragile emotional state that is Cox's area of expertise. ""Shelia"", a taut pop song with a great chorus hook, is a change-up, though the repeating refrain ""No one wants to die alone"" fits with the rest of the record's themes. And ""Washington School"", with its dissonant chime of metallic percussion that sound like gamelan or evilly out-of-tune steel drums, contains the record's most interesting production, with thick drones reminiscent of Tim Hecker and menacing rhythm track. So some things are different, some are the same, but all of it works well together. It's true that every time Cox ventures out of his comfort zone on Logos, you wish that he'd go even further and embrace extremes-- of tunefulness, tradition, noise-- that don't necessarily come to him naturally. He may yet take a big leap with Atlas Sound, but here the steps away, though rewarding, are tentative. For the rest of the record, Logos feels familiar and assuring, another affecting dispatch from a corner of indie music that is increasingly starting to seem like one Cox pretty much owns.","With contributions from LÃ¦titia Sadier of Stereolab and Panda Bear, the Deerhunter frontman continues to expand the parameters of his solo project.

Geneva,Russian Circles,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c3c0084474cd0c0a3e/1:1/w_160/156afd05.jpg,2009-10-21 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13607-geneva/,Suicide Squeeze,"It may share its name with another second city, but the third LP from the Russian Circles calls to mind a fairly famous quote from one of their hometown's favorite sons. ""Chicago is an October sort of city even in spring,"" Nelson Algren wrote, and Geneva's an October sort of album no matter when you put it on. Geneva feels very much like the city its members hang their hats: rusty and steely and shifty, overcast and a little cold, and-- Algren again-- ""battle-colored."" It evokes a long early morning's drive down the length of any one of Chicago's city-spanning north-south thoroughfares, blowing through both industrial grit and beatific parkways, eyes peeled for crumbling facades and flashes of chrome and the not-so-occasional pothole. There were signposts to Geneva all over the spiny, immediate Enter and last year's prettier, driftier Station, but on their third go, the Circles are clearing a path all for themselves. Debts are still due to genre godheads like Mogwai and Slint, for certain, but like the best work of their obvious forebears, on Geneva the Circles have found a way to make three guys in a room sound like a lot more than three guys in a room. Credit where credit's due: a great deal of Geneva's success lies in the string work of cellist Allison Chesley and violinist Susan Voelz, who add a resonant depth to many of the record's best moments, filling in the gaps around these insistent compositions with a kind of sweeping gothic grime. But even without the hired hands, Russian Circles are penning limber, purpose-driven tunes, then playing the hell out of them. And, in their structure and execution both, this is doubtless their finest work yet. Instrumental prowess is a double-edged sword in just about any genre, but when instrumental's all you do, you run the risk of the dreaded wank with every flick of the wrist. That's something the Circles in general and Brian Cook in particular have handled admirably through the years; they're capable of sneaking thunderous Lightning Bolt-style blastoffs and fingery Yngwie thingys in with opulent drift, while coming across as neither tossers or tossed-off. Drummer Dave Turncrantz gets plenty in, but favors the boom over the barrage, and guitarist Mike Sullivan, as Pitchfork's Cosmo Lee pointed out in his review of Station, often cedes the presumptive lead role for the good of the group. But it's Cook who's come into his own here on Geneva, consistently holding down the low end with inventive but unshowy aplomb. And when he's given a shot at the spotlight-- a position he takes only a handful of times throughout-- the record is his. The Circles have long done peaks far better than valleys, and there's really only one such dip on Geneva: ""Hexed All"", a tune they all but give over to Chesley and Voelz, flipping the melee of, well, ""Melee"" for a supine string-laden swoon. It's clearly meant as a respite from the relative brutality that surrounds it-- much like the first few minutes of ""Verses"" was to the middle of Station-- but it also works against the album's momentum a touch, the widescreen beauty of Explosions in the Sky reformatted to fit your screen. It's fine, but it's not necessary; the string section is so seamlessly integrated into the Circles' sound on meatier tracks like ""Fathom"", putting them front and center feels more like a conciliatory gesture than a Russian Circles tune. The record's second half favors an enveloping crumble over the opening trio's crushing hypnotism; tracks unfurl more patiently, perhaps more gracefully, but with nearly the same sense of purpose that underlies the weightier start-up. Save the proggy ""Malko"", this stuff is textbook post-rock; songs start soft and slow, more elements get thrown into the mix, and we eventually have our climax. Still, there's a sense of internal dynamics in the tunes that makes this particularly good textbook post-rock; instead of a simple gradual increase in volume, they pull in sounds from left-field, lending the tunes a ratchety, rust-covered feeling that is unusually complex.Â Nearly all of these tunes die screaming, they just take a bit longer to get there as Geneva goes on. It's more a matter of contrast than anything else; were the running order reversed, you'd sit on your hands through the first half waiting for the impending blowout. I suppose this, too, is like Chicago, with the livelier South Side giving way to the statelier North, both with their unique merits. Either way, Geneva's a record with dirt underneath its fingernails and resolute urgency at its heart, and like the place from which it hails, it's worth the bluster.","Chicago post-rock band makes its best album yet, both in structure and execution.

Black Beach,Excepter,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a3b1335d7bf1698e94/1:1/w_160/b47ff913.jpg,2009-10-21 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13581-black-beach/,Paw Tracks,"Few bands seem as genuinely ambivalent toward their listeners as Excepter. Their aesthetic-- a sort of aboriginal futurism, where ceremonial rattles shake alongside misfiring machines-- involves each member improvising along esoterically personal paths. Everyone inhabits the solitary world of their little drum or shaker with catatonic intensity, and the music emerges in serendipitous exchanges between private black-outs. They don't mind trawling through tedium to get where they're going: Loops seem to be crafted by trial and error, until pockets of energy flare up in the deadening spaces. At their best, Excepter urge these spasms of life toward payoffs that feel all the more rewarding for their precariousness. But on Black Beach, they smudge the line between letting the magic happen and just nodding out. ""Castle Morro"" represents Excepter at their best. Dawn-of-man percussion and a hollowed-out bass pulse gradually merge, with organic rigor, into a mutant dance track, throbbing with unnatural life. But elsewhere, the album feels meager and under-imagined. Dedicating two out of five songs to lightly manipulated seaside recordings (""Pismo Pool"" and ""[Waves]"") is half-assed. ""Sand Dollar"" is soothing, with scattered taps and rustles amid sea-hush and a quiet flute theme, but never becomes more than pleasant. The 16-minute title track is more compelling, with a broad array of primitive instruments-- guiro, thumb piano, those metal egg-shaped bell-things, rattles, gongs, steel drums, tiny wind instruments-- divulging a rainbow of timbres. The problem is that Black Beach, as a pure listening experience, is a little too ""you had to be there."" The record comes with an artily photographed making-of DVD, and if Pitchfork were a film site, the rating would be higher-- Black Beach works much better in visual format. Basically, Excepter rounded up a bunch of half-dressed fashion-hippies at Big Sur and had them zone out with hand instruments, playing against natural sounds instead of mechanical loops. In the video, the pieces gain important context-- ""Sand Dollar"" is for walking down cliffs toward a seductive shore; ""Castle Morro"" buries the sun. The famously stunning scenery does a lot for the music. And the title track is just a lot cooler when you know there's a naked guy jingling bells on a strip of scavenged seaweed, and a gong being gently struck with a live crab. As a video, Black Beach has a nice communing-with-nature spirit that we can connect with-- although it's like putting a price tag on a Big Sur sunset, or any experience that has mostly first-hand value.","Working better in visual format than on disc, this CD/DVD from the often inscrutable experimental band capturesÂ a nice communing-with-nature spirit.

Skin and Bones / Mo Beauty,Flashy PythonAlec Ounsworth,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a413d197565213921c/1:1/w_160/ce2e670b.jpg,2009-10-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13582-skin-and-bones-mo-beauty/,self-released,"Refracted through rock mythology, the first chapter of Alec Ounsworth's story plays out in one of two stock ways. The first: Wanting nothing to do with the online hype typhoon attending Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's first album, he kills the band with a Difficult Second Album, 2007's Some Loud Thunder. The second, equally familiar way to frame the narrative comes from Ounsworth himself: ""If I want to do something with a particular group of people, I will. And if I don't, I won't. If people are willing to work on those terms, that's good. If not, I'll just have to figure out a different way."" Though I suspect his full story includes elements of both tropes, I'll give Ounsworth the benefit of the doubt-- at the least, it makes chapter two easier to understand. This latest stage sees Ounsworth as an itinerant songwriter, recruiting collaborators to flesh out a heap of previously written material. On Skin and Bones, credited to Flashy Python and available only from his website, he hires all manner of Philly indie luminaries/friends (members of Dr. Dog, Mazarin, the Walkmen, and Man Man appear) to collaborate on a wheezy, dark song cycle-cum-inebriated stumble down South Street. Mo Beauty, released on Anti-, is more a proper solo album as we know these things, yet also recorded with significant help: at New Orleans' Piety St. studio, with a dozen or so local pros. Thus, two fresh plot-twists: Bones is druggy rock'n'roll so uniform in sound and sentiment it feels like a one-off concept album; Beauty is more variegated and takes more chances: Ounsworth showing his chops. Lyrically, Skin and Bones is a sort of treatise on growing up and settling down while staying weird, cut with lamentations on the false consciousness of those who've chosen to follow the herd. The vibe is overwhelmingly woozy, with Wurlitzer and Hammond-laden arrangements spiked with jagged guitars and Ounsworth's instantly recognizable squawk, which more than ever evokes some anachronistic eccentric, twirling around a bar and liberally quoting Ezra Pound. On the title track, he bleats out a skewed requiem for life passing him by (""Nothing's wrong, the spaceship comes from inside!"") before crying out to his wife Emily to take him home. ""Cattle's New Clothes"" is spiked with pedal steel, as Ounsworth lays into an ex-undergrounder-turned-square (""Look at him go down with the businessmen cattle""). Though it's possible to enjoy the atmosphere of Bones without worrying about lyrics, one does need a taste for murky and tipsy ambience. Ounsworth gets fucked up straightaway on the opening track, a giddy, staggering thing held up by Toby Leaman and Matt Barrick's muscular rhythm section. He free-associates for a few minutes before the piece trails off with Billy Dufala's skronking saxophone coda, the musical equivalent of belching loudly while getting pushed out of the bar. ""Ichiban Blues"", a sour take on exotic travel, is the most straightforward song on the album, and cinema ode ""In the Darkness"" will satiate those looking for a return to the gangly new wave of the CYHSY stuff. Like those lost evenings we've all had, Bones is a good time while it lasts, but not necessarily something to return to all that often. Ounsworth's likeness to David Byrne began with CYHSY's still lovely ""Over and Over Again"", and the comparisons won't stop with Mo Beauty-- though for slightly different reasons. Where Byrne himself once decamped in the Big Easy to work with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band for the spare, stately score of Knee Plays, Ounsworth went to New Orleans to hook up with former Meters bassist George Porter, Jr., keyboardist Robert Walter of the Greyboy Allstars, and a dozen or so others. ""I've romanticized that city's aesthetic since I visited there when I was 12,"" he told our news section last August. ""The music seems to just flow out of people naturally."" The result of Ounsworth bottling this ""flow"" and working it into a set of songs is an album that showcases the breadth of his talents much more than the limited palettes of Flashy Python or CYHSY. Steve Berlin's crisp production highlights the collaborators' vibrant contributions while keeping Ounsworth front and center, resulting in a balanced, evocative work with a focus, appropriately enough, on place. Between the solemn, achingly pretty ballad ""Holy, Holy, Holy Moses (Song for New Orleans)"" and the jaunty, acoustic ""South Philadelphia (Drug Days)"", Ounsworth is able, like Byrne, to balance tics with songcraft, and play in opposite ends of the emotional spectrum (post-Katrina anomie, getting fucked up as a kid) with an aura of effortlessness. Elsewhere, ""Idiots in the Rain"" brings the brass to bear on a tune about the exuberance of a French Quarter band revving up, and ""Bones in the Grave"" is a creaky, spooky bit that by itself explains the LPs release on Anti-. Yet speaking about both records, Ounsworth told us that Skin and Bones was ""more about me trying to erect some grand statement,"" while Mo Beauty is ""going down to New Orleans for a short period of time and trying to piece something together based on a collection of mostly old songs."" Hmmm, okay. But one of these ""pieced-together old songs"" happens to be ""That Is Not My Home (After Bruegel)"", a set of vignettes each beginning with ""me and the wife,"" set to a wonderful blend of swoony new wave, punchy brass, and torrid string swells, which just might be the best song he's ever done. That's one of the ironies of authorship, though: Too often, the author himself can be his own worst enemy when it comes to his own real-life narrative, dismissing his most inspired work in lieu of something which, for whatever reason, he finds himself closer to. For our sake (and his), let's hope he relegates future Flashy Python work to footnote status, and continues staking his persona on more adventurous projects.","The Clap Your Hands Say Yeah frontman returns with two markedly different albums, one recorded with help from Philly pals and one recorded in New Orleans.

The Fountain,Echo and the Bunnymen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b2c0084474cd0c0a0f/1:1/w_160/3490e7b5.jpg,2009-10-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13592-the-fountain/,Ocean Rain,"Echo and the Bunnymen have now released as many studio albums since their reunion as the original quartet did during its run in the 1980s. Comparing the two careers directly probably isn't fair-- after all, it was the same quartet of Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant, Les Pattinson, and Pete de Freitas that made those first five albums, whereas the reunion version never had de Freitas (he died in a motorcycle accident in 1989) and lost Pattinson after one album. Anyone who thinks bassists and drummers aren't important to the sound of a rock band could take a lesson there, as not having their old rhythm section has clearly made a difference. Of course, age has too. Whether they were trying to keep up with the Britpop kids (1997's Evergreen), acting their middle age (1999's What Are You Going to Do With Your Life?), returning to their post-punk roots (2001's Flowers), or hitting the autopilot (2005's Siberia), it was always clear that the Bunnymen's second life was (no pun) a mere echo of their first. That autopilot they engaged on Siberia is still pretty well punched on The Fountain. McCulloch's always going to be a great singer, and Sergeant's always going to be a great guitarist with his own style, but the two have reached a point here where they seem to be cranking out these second-generation Bunnymen tunes in the way a Toyota Corolla factory cranks out cars. It's efficient and the quality is solid, but it's not that exciting either. You do get a few aces, chief among them lead track and single ""I Think I Need It Too"", which has the classic sonorous McCulloch vocal, some liquid guitar leads from Sergeant, and a big, pumping chorus. ""Proxy"" is a pleasant surprise, going outside the band's usual box to scare up a piano-driven pop tune with breathy ""whoa-oh-oh"" backing vocals-- it's infectiously happy, not something you can say about many songs by this band, and if I were choosing, it'd be the next single. A good portion of the rest of the album basically photocopies ""I Think I Need It Too"", mining the same general sound for less return. ""Do You Know Who I Am?"" pairs a guitar part so melodically slight it makes little impression with a verse vocal consisting entirely of two-word phrases matching verbs with the word ""it."" The title track and ""Shroud of Turin"" are rote mid-tempo Bunnymen. They get more mileage from the formula on ""Drivetime"", which has good backing vocals and more considered guitar leads, while ""Life of 1,000 Crimes"" distinguishes itself with a spry, stomping rhythm, some bells low in the mix and a nimble vocal from McCulloch. That's about 180 degrees from the dour, piano-dominated closer ""The Idolness of Gods"", where McCulloch sounds weary, perhaps lulled near sleep by the string synthesizer or his own down/ground/drowned rhyme scheme. The band's classic albums and best reunion discs (Evergreen and Flowers) have a cavernous darkness and intensity that McCulloch and Sergeant simply don't muster here. Ultimately, The Fountain is an echo of an echo, inessential to all but the band's most devoted followers.","The 1980s legends continue their lengthy second act with a record that aims to remind listeners of the band's past rather than recast it in new light.

Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix [Remix Collection],Phoenix,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69c5e6ef95969320da5/1:1/w_160/7c2352e4.jpg,2009-10-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13576-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix-remix-collection/,GlassnoteLoyautÃ©,"The past few years have given us not only a shit ton of remixes, but also of remix compilations. Looking back, remix collections have usually tended to draw on songs from multiple albums, whether we're talking about the Beatles' Love, Madonna's You Can Dance, or Blur's Bustin' + Dronin'. These days, everybody's pulling from the Further Down the Spiral playbook: Bloc Party have released not one, but two remixed versions of individual albums, LCD Soundsystem recently gave us 45:33 Remixes, and Mariah Carey is already said to be working on a remixed version of her latest, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel. When you compile even the best remixes from one album, rather than an entire career, there's going to be more bloat. It's just inevitable. And bloat of any kind is anathema to a group like Phoenix, whose suave electro-rock is nothing if not streamlined. ""I think it was Lord Byron who said at some point that there were too many books for a human being to read,"" lead singer Thomas Mars told a recent interviewer from Webcuts Music. ""You know it's the same now: There are too many remixes! There's no time to hear them, technically in a lifetime."" You could almost say the same thing about new Phoenix remixes alone. The French four-piece's triumphant 2009 album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, has been helping drive HypeMachine traffic for months, in part because the group shared the instrumental ""stems"" for first single ""1901"" at the same time they posted the original mp3. (If that wasn't enough, the band has also streamed demos and acoustic tracks from the album.) So Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Remix Collection) was probably inevitable. Its source material is impeccable. Its remixers are Internet-nerd A-list. And a few of the remixes are actually pretty fucking good. As an album, the digital-only Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Remix Collection) is also kind of frustratingly odd. I doubt even Sofia Coppola will feel the need to listen to the whole thing, straight through, very many times. As for DJs, you can probably guess from the fact that only one of the compilation's 15 tracks exceeds six minutes this isn't one of those remix CDs that makes all the originals more dance-friendly. Nor is it a remixed version of the entire album: The whole thing is built from only eight underlying songs. If you're listening at home, and you want to hear ""Fences"" five times in a little more than an hour, plus ""1901"" and ""Lisztomania"" a couple of times apiece, and you're tired of simply putting Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix's first three tracks on repeat, then this is the album for you. It's hard to stay annoyed with any of that, though, when so many of the individual tracks are so strong. Phoenix albums are typically (gloriously) front-loaded; this one feels back-loaded by comparison. Subtitled ""Deakin's Jam"", Animal Collective's take on the Tangerine Dream-y space-out of ""Love Like a Sunset"" deserves to be mentioned alongside both group's best efforts this year, drone-drowned and ecstatic. While the original ""Rome"" burns with white-hot cigarette-ash guitar distortion, a remix credited to ""Neighbours with Devendra Banhart"" fiddles (quite nicely) with piano and acoustic guitar, creating a gentle, atmospheric space for the loveless narrator to get his shit sorted out. Other high-profile remixers' work here is consistently above-average, if rarely on par with the originals a lot of us pretty much know by heart by now. Passion Pit's ""1901 Bo Flex'd"" tweak goes deeper into John Hughes movies, with hugely romantic synths, but its clickety-clackety arrangement is disappointingly cluttered. Yacht does the farty bass thing with ""Armistice"", to so-so effect (when Mars sings, ""Look what you wasted,"" it sounds almost accusatory). San Diego ex-Muslims the Soft Pack steal the show with a scuzzy, garage-rocking quasi-cover of ""Fences"". The rest of the compilation definitely won't blow your hair back like the first time you heard Phoenix, but it probably won't make you get up and adjust the iPod boombox, either. UK indie-dance trio Friendly Fires' piano-house remix of ""Fences"" could use a little personality, but it's a fine idea skillfully executed; same with Brooklyn dream-pop band Chairlift's haze-ification of the same track. Turzi's ""Love Like a Sunset"" has nothing on Deakin's jam, but the French five-piece do a decent job of raising the original's Krautrock-psych quotient. England's Alex Metric and France's Boombass offer up some pounding potential Ed Banger or KitsunÃ© material. Speaking of: Where's that dreamy ""Lisztomania"" remix by L.A. duo Classixx that appeared on KitsunÃ© Maison 7? Or that Don Diablo ""99 Fences"" Jay-Z mash-up? (OK, copyright law, got it.) Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix has made Phoenix, deservingly, one of the year's biggest indie-rock success stories. They've appeared on ""Saturday Night Live"", sold more than 135,000 copies, and landed a spot in a widely viewed Cadillac commercial. If the album has anything to do with the battle between Phoenix's inner Mozart and the group's inner Franz Liszt, though-- referring to the 19th-century musician who gives ""Lisztomania"" its name-- then Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Remix Collection) has more in common with whichever one suffered a momentary lapse of editing skills. Your move, Mariah.","Phoenix have their 2009 tracks remixed by Animal Collective, Passion Pit, Devendra Banhart, Chairlift, and more.

At the Cut,Vic Chesnutt,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65fb1335d7bf1698df8/1:1/w_160/d99155d2.jpg,2009-10-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13520-at-the-cut/,Constellation,"Vic Chesnutt could rarely be accused of having a sunny disposition, but even considering that, his latest album features some truly harrowing material. On his latest LP, At the Cut, he is staring mortality in the eye, taking on existential themes with a pile of cultural references, and still working his mind around the nearly fatal accident that left him paraplegic on the verge of adulthood in 1983. As on 2007's North Star Deserter, Chesnutt is here joined by members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra, as well as Fugazi's Guy Picciotto. Together they build a sound that walks a line between country-folk, Southern soul, and post-rock, which works because the music's uncertainty about its identity often mirrors Chesnutt's own doubt. Opener ""Coward"" deals in dread and aggression with its crawling tempo and doom-laden, harmonized guitar outbursts. When Chesnutt's ragged voice shreds the phrase, ""I am a coward,"" in a long, agonized shout, it's not an admission-- it's a threat. It's frightening, bombastic, and a bit messy, and it's a good announcement for an intermittently foreboding album that occasionally drags a bit. The title of ""It Is What It Is"" adopts an annoying phrase as a pathway to Chesnutt's accepting not only his own flaws and inconsistencies but also whatever comes after death. The song references Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, Kafka, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Henry Darger, and W.H. Auden, and culminates in a wickedly incisive rejection of religion (""I don't need stone altars to help me hedge my bet against the looming blackness""). Not every track has quite so much to say-- the lyrics of ""Philip Guston"" are quite minimal, serving as a bit of seasoning for a broken-down violin and guitar jam, while the affecting closer, ""Granny"", is built around a simple, quiet reminiscence about Chesnutt's grandmother making pimiento cheese at the kitchen sink. There are a couple of welcome leavening moments-- the bright organ and Leslie cabinet guitar of ""Concord Country Jubilee"" chief among them-- but At the Cut is foremost a dark album, and about as far tonally and sonically as Chesnutt has been from 2003's highly polished Silver Lake. The restraint of the musicians involved leaves Chesnutt's fragility at the center of the music and lends the album an air of refinement and wisdom that could have easily been drowned out by guitarists more eager to call attention to themselves.","Working with the same lineup as 2007's North Star Deserter, Chesnutt blends country-folk, Southern soul, and post-rock around dark, existential lyrics.

Yeah Ghost,Zero 7,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6bcc0084474cd0c0a2e/1:1/w_160/24ff85a0.jpg,2009-10-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13601-yeah-ghost/,Atlantic,"Hey, Zero 7 still exist. Did you know that? I have to admit I did not. The words ""Zero 7"" probably hadn't popped into my head for nigh on five years, around the time I last worked in a record store. I remember the duo's music (specifically 2004's When It Falls) making a good fallback when someone complained that Franz Ferdinand was a little too abrasive, Zero 7 being the downtempo act with the gall to debut well after the fad had peaked. Hey, it was that kinda store. Zero 7 would probably like you to know that Yeah Ghost is some sort of omnivorous post-MP3 pop record, not downtempo. Zero 7 was probably better off identifying Yeah Ghost as downtempo, a genre where it's practically impossible to limbo under where the bar's been set for what constitutes ""interesting music."" Even your voracious consumer of vacuous VH1-style adult-alternative would still have to listen reeeeeeeally hard to find anything remotely exceptional about Yeah Ghost. The rest of us are S.O.L. Yeah Ghost is one of those albums where it sounds like the band happened on a bargain sale for just-past-expiration fads and a few genuinely necrotic oldies. It's easy to feel generous when you've bought garbage cheap and in bulk. No Ghost track gets by on one bad idea when Zero 7 can give us two or three. So ""Mr McGee"" treats us to some horrorshow mix of vaguely post-Amy Winehouse, generically sassy R&B vocals and a cod-glam/Marc Bolan beat that was at least marginally interesting when Goldfrapp swiped it from German techno six years ago. (""Medicine Man"" more or less repeats the exact same formula without a hint of shame.) ""Swing"" is the sort of winsome nuevo twee-pop that turned the Juno soundtrack into a glorified ATM for its compilers, shoved through overly glossy George Martin pastiche that dangerously ups the saccharine level. ""Everything Up (Zizou)"" is low-impact dance-rock with every possible edge shorn off. ""Sleeper"" is the bad blog-house remix of rock band du jour. (I hear the Gossip, yr mileage may vary.) And the overall vibe is: Every 2000s trendlet must go! All these reheated ideas wouldn't be so bad in the aggregate if the band attacked the material with the slightest verve, rather than the pop-slumming loop-heads they come off as here. The whole thing's like Basement Jaxx for the undemanding: all of the sonically-overstuffed, cross-genre shtick, none of the energy, wit, or timeliness that makes the Jaxx (or at least old Jaxx) more than channel-hopping thieves. About the only time Yeah Ghost comes to life is on the sleepy drift of ""Ghost SYMbOL"" (admittedly about one vocal sample from being a straight Burial jack) and ""Solastalgia"" (ditto, but maybe Fennesz for Banana Republic in-store play?), which at least proves Zero 7's instincts for make-weight downtempo haven't deserted them. So wait, I hear you asking, it's slightly unclear: Is Yeah Ghost any good? You know, as art? Well, the cover's pretty. But as music, whether pop or downtempo or lukewarm filler for marking the hours until death? Okay, it's not really very good at all. But it's there nonetheless. If you happen to work in one of the country's few remaining record stores, it will probably prove useful in placating those who don't want to be harassed by Lady Gaga as they browse. Sadly I may be among them.","Zero 7 return, not with a downtempo album but some sort ofÂ omnivorous post-MP3 pop record.

CrownsDown,Themselves,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b6c0084474cd0c0a1c/1:1/w_160/99cfe0a6.jpg,2009-10-20 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13596-crownsdown/,Anticon,"My elementary school teacher told my class that he believed you were granted a certain number of words in your life, and once you've said them all, you die. (Yeah, in elementary school-- he was a pretty weird dude.) The fact that Doseone is still sucking air contradicts his theory. The motor-mouthed rapper would have used up any reasonable allotment after Themselves' 1999 debut, Them, and he's continued to vent his glossomania with Subtle, cLOUDDEAD, 13 & God, and other projects over the ensuing decade. But maybe my teacher was right, and this is just a ""deal with the devil"" situation, where Dose traded any prospect of mainstream success for a bottomless bag of language, an unmistakable nasal whine to distinguish his voice, and an unnatural capacity for rapid-fire enunciation. Dose was a founding member of experimental hip-hop collective Anticon, and like many of his peers, his relationship to rap has grown more abstract over the years. Them was a very strange record, with tweaky, minimal beats (by the other half of Themselves, Jel) that showcased Dose's verbal arsenal: rhymes so tightly clustered that ""internal"" doesn't do them justice; protean timbres and cadences; sound effects, whispers, giggles, funny accents. But for all of its spoken-wordy set pieces and surreal imagery, it was undeniably a rap record, rooted in rhymes-and-breaks fundamentals. The same cannot be said of much work by Dose's other groups, where sung vocals, electro-pop, and post-rock have at least as much traction as hip-hop. WithÂ CrownsDown, their first album since 2002's indescribableÂ The No Music, Themselves take up the rap-saving talking points upon which Anticon was founded in a major way, with a strong conservative slant to their science fiction. It's a back-to-basics album from a group who probably needs one, having ventured so far afield. Opening track ""Back II Burn"" is probably the closest Dose will ever come to ""Mama Said Knock You Out"", a pugilistic comeback with snarled boasts and victorious synth stabs. Jel's live MPC jam on ""Skinning the Drum"" catches up classic breaks like ""Apache"" and ""Cold Sweat"". Only ""You Ain't It"" takes a page from modern rap, with Auto-Tuned singing by Subtle's Dax Pierson. (And even that could arguably be called a nod to electro.) Most of the album is a direct homage to the aggressive, cluttered productions of the Bomb Squad and the splashy electro of Afrika Bambaataa, with Dose's flow keyed to the repetitive rhyme schemes of the old school, amid lots of turntable scratches and tick-tick-boom. Content-wise, it's about as easy to summarize as a volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica, but rest assured that it liberally treats all of the following topics: wack MCs, style-biters, cultural decline, social injustice, and the worst scourge of all, bootleggers. Of course, for these guys, ""back-to-basics"" is relative. ""Oversleeping"" is full of clangorous machine noise, which clears up when Dose spits photon streams into the microphone. ""Deadcatclear II"", a sort of enigmatic confessional, surfs on wobbly drones and drum hits that spill out static like scatter bombs. ""Roman Is as Roman Does"" is like Melle Mel meets TV on the Radio, if TVOTR were heavily influenced by Alvin and the Chipmunks. The clash of hoary hip-hop tropes and future-jacking excursions creates a discordant feeling; it's like reading a novel with every fifth word translated into Martian. The record is so crammed with bizarre details, and so relentless in its full-frontal attack, that it verges on being indigestible. Themselves, whose platform surely includes anathema for instant gratification, probably wouldn't have it any other way. I prefer the more minimal style of Them, which was sharply critical-- and deeply personal-- without being hectoring or bombastic. But listeners who enjoy picking apart seam-bursting sonic worlds will find plenty to explore here.","Anticon group takes up its rap-saving banner again in a major way, craftingÂ a back-to-basics album.

The Real Feel,Spiral Stairs,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67e5e6ef95969320d56/1:1/w_160/948d9236.jpg,2009-10-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13547-the-real-feel/,Matador,"It's not mandatory for great bands to balance a dominant vocal personality with a foil, but it makes sense that it happens so often. A good No. 2 doesn't need to be less interesting than the star-- Flavor Flav is surely a more magnetic figure than Chuck D, for example-- but at best, they establish a necessary contrast that casts the lead in sharper relief. The star shines brighter, the subtext runs deeper, and the emotional range gets broader. In indie rock terms, think of how Kim Deal's easy-going stoner femininity emphasizes Black Francis' tightly-wound nerd masculinity, or the way Lee Renaldo's hipster everyman style offsets the larger-than-life personae of Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon. Pavement may not have had a vocal dynamic as profound as Public Enemy, the Pixies, or Sonic Youth, but Stephen Malkmus had his appropriate foil in the form of Scott ""Spiral Stairs"" Kannberg. Spiral was no less shambling and inscrutable, but he was very good at playing the self-effacing underdog to Malkmus' nonchalant indie alpha male. It would be an error to label his songs as more ""sincere""-- he was consistently a far more cryptic and opaque lyricist than SM-- but he was capable of projecting a nervous vulnerability that destabilized the freakishly self-assured vibe of Pavement's first four albums in a way that was positive and necessary. Even if Spiral Stairs was not crucial to either Pavement's appeal or Malkmus' success, his presence offered a subtle balance and contrast, and yielded at least a few classics: ""Kennel District"" from Wowee Zowee; ""Date With Ikea"" from Brighten the Corners. In the time since Pavement's dissolution in 1999, Kannberg has stepped into the role of the frontman with mixed results. Despite the nod to George Harrison's All Things Must Pass in its title, his debut as the leader of the Preston School of Industry did not reveal him to be an extraordinary songwriter obscured by the flash of his former partner, but rather just a serviceable author of amiable but not especially interesting indie rock. He pushed himself further by embracing alt-country on the follow-up, Monsoon, but the record was a tuneless, dreary mess, and it is undoubtedly the worst release ever to be associated with anyone having to do with Pavement. The central problem with the Preston School of Industry albums is that the very things that made Kannberg an effective foil for Malkmus also made him exhausting and dull as the focal point of a band. Whereas he was once the Milhouse Van Houten to Malkmus' Bart Simpson, he had devolved into being an incoherent indie equivalent of Milhouse's dad mewling ""Can I Borrow a Feeling?"" After a five-year hiatus from recording, Kannberg has dissolved the Preston School of Industry, or perhaps more accurately, rebranded the project as Spiral Stairs. This is a sensible decision. Preston School of Industry was a terrible name for a band, and Spiral Stairs was always one of the better stage names in alt-rock. The reversion to the Stairs moniker could be taken as a signal that Kannberg has returned to form, but anyone expecting anything along the lines of his Pavement tunes will be let down by the contents of The Real Feel, his first record under the name. Kannberg's new music mostly takes its cues from Neil Young and mid-period Bob Dylan, and to a certain extent, the ragged yet expansive sound suits his strengths as a guitarist and his weaknesses as an often aggravatingly nasal vocalist. ""True Love"", the album opener, is confident and sharp despite feeling more than a bit generic, and tracks like ""Maltese T"" and ""Cold Change"" are minor works, yet successful on their own terms. Even the weakest cuts on The Real Feel are at least passable genre exercises, but at a point it becomes difficult to tell whether they are actually good faux-Neil Young songs, or if these tunes would have any appeal at all to listeners who were not hardcore Pavement fans with an unusually large amount of goodwill for the band's less famous founding member. Though he is still prone to writing nonsense lyrics nearly devoid of resonance, Kannberg has opened up significantly as a lyricist, though his most emotional and unguarded moments on ""Call the Ceasefire"" and ""Blood Money"" are mostly quite banal. Unlike many of his previous works, he seems far more interested in revealing himself and connecting with an audience, but even though his voice has grown stronger, he still sings everything as if he can't stand to make eye contact with you. The music is a clear step up from his nadir on Monsoon, but it's only a lateral move in terms of quality compared to the first two Preston School releases. His style may shift, but Kannberg remains an unambitious songwriter and underwhelming frontman. It could just be that he's the type of person who best thrives as a second banana. Then again, maybe all he needs is a foil of his own.","After working for a decade as the Preston School of Industry, Pavement founder Scott Kannberg releases his first album as Spiral Stairs.

I Told You I Was Freaky,Flight of the Conchords,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a695c0084474cd0c09cc/1:1/w_160/36de5ee4.jpg,2009-10-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13570-i-told-you-i-was-freaky/,Sub Pop,"Protest if you must, but the second season of ""Flight of the Conchords"" somehow ended up being better than the first. Fair may it be to argue that Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie's Kiwi hipster-doofus schtick had outworn its welcome (the dubious return of Bret's ""Rap Dancin'"" crew-neck sweatshirt might be all the proof needed there), the faux-folk duo found themselves backed by better writing, more screen time for all those increasingly brilliant auxiliary characters, and, in some respects, better songs. If for nothing else, it's well worth the price of the DVD for the pleasure of having the timeless image of a baffled Jemaine confronted by an identically dressed Art Garfunkel permanently seared onto your frontal lobe. But about those songs. Like their self-titled debut, I Told You I Was Freaky collects the musical focal point(s) from each episode, presented untouched and sold as an album. Unlike the debut, which effortlessly presented itself as a straight-up comedy record that succeeded independently of the accompanying television program, Freaky sort of only works as a soundtrack, slave to the mutual exclusivity of its visual counterpoint. So even the fact that most of the songs here are funnier, more varied, and in most cases more tuneful and catchy than their predecessors, most of the payoff is tied to whether or not you're able to reenact in your head the very same imprudent predicament featured on the screen. For example, there's the falsetto-laden ""We're Both in Love With a Sexy Lady"", a spot-on send-up of R. Kelly and Usher's ""Same Girl"". While the idea may seem pitch-perfect, the song has an awful lot to do with the particulars of the episode where both Jemaine and Bret fall hard for a girl with an epileptic dog. If you're already on board, the song's still great fun-- if not, it's simply a plot-tie set to music. Though I seriously doubt there will be more than a couple of people out there picking up this record without having seen ""Flight of the Conchords"", it's difficult to fully enjoy something that so critically hinges on external specifics. So even in rare cases where songs fall flat, like the Police-baiting ""You Don't Have to Be a Prostitute"" or ""Angels"", you don't even have the memory of Jemaine hooking in too-short-shorts to pad them with. It's almost as if those geniuses at HBO are trying to boost DVD sales or something... On the other hand, there are plenty of tracks here that require no memory-jogging to enjoy, from the crunk-tweaked ""Sugalumps"" (a clever inversion of ""My Humps"") to the trashy B-more club bounce of ""Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)"" (see a theme emerging here?). In fact, quite a few of these cuts come dangerously close to seamlessly adapting to the, ahem, goof-less Hot 100 landscape, where both Trey Songz's excellent ode to sexting, ""LOL :-)"", and LMFAO's confoundingly idiotic ""I'm in Miami Bitch"" remain comfortably seated. It's no joke that there's real talent at work here: The joke-y new-wave synth exercise ""Fashion is Danger"" is too generically silly to leave a mark, but even the filler content-- ""I'm the edge, I'm the chic, I'm the taste/ I'm larger than life with just a hint of lace""-- has enough bite to resonate with the shrewdest of Lady Gaga fans. Much like with the show, if the big idea keels over, you can expect a million little baby ideas to come spilling out, each one more charming than the last. But the separation anxiety that Freaky induces is its unfortunate undoing, though we can least be glad that someone had the good sense not to include dialogue interludes for context's sake. Call it a noble sacrifice for the good of the series, but one that ultimately leaves the album looking a little too much like a party favor long after the credits have rolled. It might be a lot to ask, but hopefully one day our heroes might get around to recording a comedy album proper, show or no show. In that case, we'll be right here. Or as Murray would say, ""present.""","The faux-folk,Â hipster-doofus duo have their Season 2Â music presented on disc, an exercise for fans rather than neophytes of the HBO show.

New Clouds,White Rainbow,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b4ea9e61561daa5412/1:1/w_160/d8ee44ae.jpg,2009-10-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13594-new-clouds/,Kranky,"Adam Forkner, the Portland-based jack-of-all-trades who's played in more bands than I could reasonably list here, has seen an increased profile recently through his collaborations with labelmates and fellow psych-rockers Valet and Atlas Sound but, as a solo artist, has remained staunchly committed to free-form improvisation. If you've seen him perform live as White Rainbow, then you know this to be true: A typical set features Forkner alone, kneeling on stage amidst of a mess of instrumentation-- guitars, pedals, synths-- that he uses to build ambient washes and vocal-looped drones on the spot. Listening to previous records like 2007's Prism of Eternal Now and taking into consideration his background in jazz, one assumes he works much the same way in the studio-- letting the music develop organically. Rather than turning toward more pop-oriented structures with his latest release, New Clouds, Forkner has indulged this spontaneous approach even further, resulting in a heady record that, while at times uneven, features some of his most compelling music yet. The album is presented like a long-form jazz or modern-classical piece, with four extended tracks (roughly 16 minutes each) that comprise one continuous movement. (Sounds arduous, I know, but it's ultimately more blissout than high-concept challenging.) It's the sort of thing that's best absorbed as a whole-- there's a general sense of moving forward through shifts in mood and momentum-- and, despite its very unplanned, impressionistic feel, mostly manages not to veer too far off course or, worse, into New Age-y background-music territory. The record's best songs (heck, ""jams"" might even be more accurate) are its first and last, which bookend the album with an energy that's less present during its middle section. Opener ""Tuesday Rollers and Strollers"" takes form over whirring electrical noises and looped, tribal-like chants before introducing skittering synths and a heavy drumbeat as it progresses. It's a fuller and more dynamic sound than Forkner was able to achieve on Prism of Eternal Now's shorter cuts (the longer track lengths here seem justified in that sense) and conjures ELO prog as much as it does the Field's vocal-spliced propulsion. ""Monday Boogies Forward Forever"", the finale, is sort of a blossoming drone that worms reverberant guitar notes through clattering background percussion and opens into a seductive coda. The tracks sandwiched between these two, ""Major Spillage"" and ""All the Boogies in the World"", are considerably slower-paced. They shift the momentum downward, drawing more on ambient textures and delicate features like hand-drum pitter-patter and acoustic guitar strumming. It's this stretch that might test the patience of those without an appetite for loose free-jamming, and you could reasonably call it a lull, but on some level it works as a calming period after the disorientating opener and sets the stage to close the record with a bang. If you're able to view it through that lens, then New Clouds has much to offer as an unscripted, decidedly un-pop kind of album: mood music and drug music, yes, but more than that, the uncompromising work of a dude making sounds strictly on his own terms.","Kranky pysch-rocker Adam Forkner indulges hisÂ spontaneous side on a heady record that's laid out like a modern classical or classic jazz work.

Zebra,Karl Blau,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b0b1335d7bf1698eab/1:1/w_160/b57bfa6b.jpg,2009-10-19 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13591-zebra/,K,"You've got to wonder how Sasha Frere-Jones feels about 2009: Not two years after the New Yorker music critic penned a lengthy piece about the increasing pallor of indie rock, the most hotly anticipated album we've yet to hear this year comes from a band of preppy New Yorkers who sing about the doing the kwassa kwassa and drinking horchata. The Dirty Projectors decorate Dave Longstreth's Sahara-informed guitar leaps-of-technique with harmonies more rhythmically complex than most delivered on this side of rock in a long time, and Animal Collective continue to pile polyrhythms and tribal chants into skewed pop oddities. Akron/Family's burrowed further into funk than ever before, and a whole fleet of rock bands are currently situated much closer to primal blues than they are to the pasty likes of Pavement. Hell, even Monsters of Folk opened their debut with a stunning soul number about faith and doubt and god and love.Â And last weekend, Frere-Jones himself interviewed Justin Vernon-- a Wisconsin cracker who sings more than a little like Bill Withers with a falsetto-- for the high-society New Yorker Festival. Tough year in the biz, as they say. Thing is, none of these developments-- and the above examples represent only the obvious-- are responses to Jones' argument. They've been around longer than that essay, ""A Paler Shade of White"". Jones simply tossed a handful of the moment's indie stars into a sea of nostalgia and hindsight, refusing to dig beyond the big bands for the (correct) fear that they'd quickly send him back to The Sketchbook of Theses. Indeed, one of the year's best counters to Jones' argument comes from Karl Blau, a prolific, curious, and mostly overlooked songwriter, producer, and instrumentalist who splits his time between Anacortes and Olympia, Wash., and K Records and Knw-Yr-Own. His latest, Zebra, is his ode to the African music he treasures and the music it prompted stateside. Importantly though, Blau integrates these styles into his approach, refusing to forsake his own shambling, inclusive ways to rock and folk to make some self-important, Afro-centric statement. These influences have been in his music all along. Hearing them just required a bit of attention. ""I've been somewhat obsessed with lots of music from Africa and music made by descendants of Africa over the last dozen years (and really my whole life),"" writes Blau, another hirsute white dude who looks a bit like a lumberjack. ""Last winter I decided to start a collection of songs recorded at Dub Narcotic in Olympia that would pay my respects to influences of African people and people of African heritage."" If you're familiar with Blau's oeuvre, this move shouldn't come as a surprise. Several years ago, he began the Kelp Lunacy Advanced Plagiarism Society, through which he'd release songs of all stripes every month or so. The series eventually stretched to 28 discs. Or consider Beneath Waves, his excellent K debut in 2006: Opener ""Crashing Waves"" is a would-be folk-rock anthem for Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy fans, and ""Shadow"" feels like Bill Callahan mocking Lou Reed. But with syncopation that won't sit still and horn charts that erupt in fits and starts, ""My Johnny"" suggests a brass band in art school. ""Into the Nada"" is, at its core, a highlife celebration, its throbbing bass, slithering guitars, and skittering drums presaging Zebra's intentions. Again, that's what's most satisfying about Zebra. Though it's Blau's ""Africa album,"" it seems, in the end, mostly like another Karl Blau record. That's not meant to deride his lack of commitment to any sound as much as it is to note the intricacy and variety of his catalog. Certainly, on Zebra, dub lessons stretch the melody and scatter the tones on ""Tha' Ole Moon Smile"". The infectious, clever ""Dark Sedan"" recalls the lo-fi set trying to grapple with a Prince infatuation (which means it sounds a little like the Blow). ""Crucial Contact"" conjures the acid washes of psychedelic soul, and ""Apology to Pollinateaurs"" suggests the humid funk of New Orleans woven into Aston Barrett's beard. ""Nothing New"", with its bone-dry guitar tone and serial riff, even feels like a Group Doueh meditation that's been cut from beneath by the sorts of jarring chords McCoy Tyner often played. But these songs-- quixotic, personal reflections with intriguing little details-- remain Blau's. That said, missteps and a few songs that aren't very memorable line Zebra. Blau played nearly everything himself here, and though he's an excellent musician on several instruments (his bass playing is fantastic), Blau occasionally overreaches his abilities: ""Free the Bird"" stumbles into a mess of Kurt Cobain vocal clichÃ©s, and Blau fumbles a few rhythm shifts. The mix of refracted guitar and tweaked synthesizer on ""Goodbye Little Song"" feels hesitant. But again, that's Blau's whole thing. On the humble Zebra, he highlights one chunk of his interests without letting it override the others. And, as always for him, that means offering a few songs that could stand to be reconsidered. Blau does what he's always done, just adding an extra beat, a washed-out tone, or thicker bass. It's a darker shade of white that-- sorry, Mr. Jones-- thankfully feels unaffected and fitting.","K Records singer/songwriter embraces African music, crafting anÂ ode to it and the music it prompted stateside.

Declaration of Dependence,Kings of Convenience,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68413d19756521391d8/1:1/w_160/379e34d8.jpg,2009-10-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13553-declaration-of-dependence/,EMI,"Kings of Convenience made headlines last month. No, wait, Leslie Feist did. It's been an eventful five years since the Norwegian duo's previous album, Riot on an Empty Street, featured the Canadian songstress on two tracks. After Erlend Ãye and Eirik GlambÃ¦k BÃ¸e's recent New York show, that a surprise Feist guest appearance got top media billing underscores just how eventful. Sorry, guys, I guess royalty isn't what it used to be. No longer does Quiet Is the New Loud, the title of Ãye and BÃ¸e's 2001 Astralwerks debut, sound like such an appealing mantra. The hushed politeness that Kings of Convenience and, earlier, Belle and Sebastian reintroduced to indie listeners around the turn of the millennium must've lost its fresh feeling somewhere between Natalie Portman big-upping the Shins and the Decemberists doing a prog-folk rock opera. Then there's the more than 400,000 copies Riot sold in Europe, a number that looks virtually impossible for a group of such modest stature today. Throw in Ãye's two mostly solid albums fronting dance-poppers the Whitest Boy Alive, and, well, what do Kings of Convenience have left to say? ""Quieter is the new quiet,"" apparently. Despite calls for the whisper-folk pair to make Ãye's house and techno background more apparent, Declaration of Dependence doubles down on hushed Scandinavian understatement. No drums, unless you count slapped fretboards or squeaking fingers: just two voices, two acoustic guitars, and occasional cello, viola, or one-finger piano plinks. Along with sharper songwriting focus, this go-for-broke softness makes for the most durable, rewarding Kings of Convenience album yet-- a Pink Moon to past efforts' Five Leaves Left. Barring a last-minute JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez surprise, it's also probably the best new full-length of its style you'll hear this year. The songs on Declaration of Dependence reveal everyday tensions with a cool, undemonstrative reserve. You can hear the spare but descriptive verses as about romance, the band itself, or global politics, depending on your preference. Where Riot opener ""Homesick"" offered the suggestive image of ""two soft voices blended in perfection,"" the new album's first track, tender ""24-25"", declares, ""What we build is bigger than the sum of two."" Slowly shuffling ""Renegade"" uses bold, vivid brush strokes to carry out that old maxim, ""If you love something, let it go""; ""Why are you whispering when the bombs are falling?"" a solitary voice asks, between slightly dissonant strums. ""Riot on an Empty Street"", a holdover since years before the album of that same name, finds a traveling singer lost for words, but not for delicate melodies. Rather than become more electronic, Kings of Convenience here choose simply to apply dance music's minimalism and sense of texture more fully to their chosen acoustic-pop form. Bittersweet single ""Mrs. Cold"" has been compared to Jack Johnson, probably because both use percussive hand slapping, but the popular surfer-turned-singer has never recorded anything so perfectly poised, so deceptively depressing; a ringing lead guitar line repeats like a looped sample. ""Boat Behind"", a single in other countries, floats a melancholy violin line over a tangled tale about reuniting with someone but never belonging to them, sounding almost like another lost Arthur Russell demo. ""Rule My World"", which follows Sweden's GonzÃ¡lez into forceful denunciations of theocratic zealotry, has the bouncy upswing of French house. Ãye's smoky falsetto fills in for the absent Feist on songs like ""Freedom and Its Owner"". ""Power of Not Knowing"" neatly echoes Simon & Garfunkel's ""April Come She Will"". Both halves of the duo now live back home in Bergen, Norway, after a multi-year absence by the Whitest Boy Alive singer. Whether inspired by lovers, each other, or the warmongers of the world, Kings of Convenience's latest is ultimately just what its title says: a bold and beautiful assertion that we are better off together than apart. Or, as ""My Ship Isn't Pretty"" wonderfully puts it: a series of ""quiet protests against loneliness.""

Celebration,Madonna,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6af13d1975652139237/1:1/w_160/3eaa04e4.jpg,2009-10-19 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13590-celebration/,Warner Bros.,"""Time goes by so slowly,"" goes the first line of Madonna's silver-anniversary-or-so-in-showbiz collection, and she doesn't quite make the case for that pronouncement. At the end of every decade, she puts out a greatest-hits set: 1990's The Immaculate Collection was the kind of perfect straight-into-orbit retrospective pop artists dream of achieving, and if 2001's GHV2 felt a little less epochal, it still collected a lot of magnificently melancholic dance songs from the following decade. Since then, she's fallen off a bit-- which is a strange way to describe eight years in which she's recorded a dozen #1 dance singles, but ""Hung Up"" is really the only song from the post-GHV2 period that's lodged in the American pop consciousness. What Madonna is ostensibly selling here-- the ""celebration,"" with its echo of her first hit, 1983's ""Holiday""-- is 26 years of being Madonna, which does get a big gold star. (The chronological 47-video DVD version of Celebration is a lot closer to the mark: A lot of the fun of her career has always been its visual side.) But what she's actually selling is an album, made for repeated listening, and that's a trickier proposition. The 2xCD edition collects roughly half her singles, including everything on Immaculate except ""Rescue Me"". For its first 12 minutes or so, it's incredibly strong-- the opening sequence of ""Hung Up"" into ""Music"" into ""Vogue"" is a convincing argument for her genius. Then the sequencing turns random or even unfortunate. Following that opening salvo with the pallid ""4 Minutes"" kills the first disc's momentum. Beginning the second disc with eight pre-1988 tracks can't help but suggest that she peaked earlier than she actually did, and the ""Take a Bow""/""Live to Tell"" pair that follows a little later drags it into ballad purgatory. Putting ""Erotica"" next to ""Justify My Love"" has the peculiar effect of suggesting that sex was just something Madonna was interested in briefly (and following them with a new one in which she sings, ""My sex is a killer/ Do you wanna die happy?"" sours them in retrospect). And the title track (the other new one), a pro forma trance collaboration with Paul Oakenfold, comes off as less celebratory than obligatory: where the new songs on Immaculate pointed Madonna's way forward for the next decade, these just sound like throwaways. One critical line on Madonna was once that she was merely a trend-jumper, an appropriator of subcultural and dance-musical developments that she treated like so many berries ripe for the plucking. As it turns out, that's exactly what's made her special in the long term: Behind that not-quite-lovely bleat and the image she manages as carefully and transparently as, say, Cindy Sherman, her chief weapon is an unbelievably dead-on sense for what sounds and styles and sexualities are ready for the big time, and a sensibility that lets her spin four minutes of pleasure or melancholy out of anything. The Madonna singles that hold up best over time, though (""Ray of Light"", ""Papa Don't Preach"", ""Don't Tell Me"", Â ""Secret""), aren't just celebrations or ballads; they've got a sense of sadness or gravity that's illuminated by the glimmering light of the disco ball. There's a lot of remarkable music on Celebration-- the work of an artist who's spent a quarter-century in a passionate body-lock with the question of what exactly makes pop music popular. She deserves a retrospective more interesting than this haphazard piece of contract-filling product.","Another Madonna compilation: This 2xCD set collects roughly half of her singles, albeit sequenced in almost random order.

The BQE,Sufjan Stevens,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b3c0084474cd0c0a13/1:1/w_160/88d58f06.jpg,2009-10-19 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13593-the-bqe/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The BQE, Sufjan Stevens' multimedia work celebrating the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, premiered in 2007 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Onstage, it was an audiovisual three-ring circus, with 16-millimeter video screening images of the roadway while costumed female hula hoopers gyrated in the foreground. Now, he has packaged the experience in a boxed set, complete with an essay in the liner notes, the DVD, a comic book, and a View-Master reel. On one hand, this is exactly the sort of quixotically huge undertaking Stevens has a weakness for. And yet, once you strip away the bells and whistles, The BQE is essentially a traditional 40-minute orchestral suite, a lightweight showpiece in which the ghosts of Gershwin, Ravel, Respighi, and other standard-orchestra-repertoire crowd-pleasers surface. In fact, until an electronic interlude crashes in about halfway through, The BQ**E could easily pass for the sort of palette-cleanser that might have opened a major orchestra's subscription concert in the 1950s. The fact that Stevens would devote his energy to something as unwieldy and time-consuming as an old-fashioned orchestral suite while his fans wait patiently for anÂ Illinois followup is perversely endearing, like learning that J.J. Abrams has put the final season of ""Lost"" on hold so he can realize his dream of reciting The Iliad. But luckily, The BQE isn't much in need of the polar-bear-on-tricycle-style praise that greeted Elvis Costello when critics learned that he wrote his Il Sogno ballet suite by hand: ""Look, it's a pop musician, and he'sÂ composing!"" The BQE is a bubbly, fun, fast-paced, and deftly written piece, full of compositional fireworks, jazzy interludes, and stylistic detours. It opens in full faux-pompous mode, trumpets blaring and woodwinds fluttering, before dissolving into a languid Romantic episode, the pillowy string writing and dewy, twinkling piano recalling Rachmaninov at his drowsiest. From there, Stevens flits through a dozen different moods and textures, a rustling-leaves pizzicato section collapsing directly into a kaleidoscopic, double-time electronic version of itself. The variations come and go breathlessly, each folding into the next without much attempt to locate the connective tissue linking them. The effect is superficial, but pleasantly bracing, like flipping quickly through the pages of a book. The accompanying DVD, which Stevens shot himself alongside cinematographer Reuben Kleiner, is supposed to drive home the connection the work has with this project's famously clogged namesake. However, instead of animating or complementing the bustling music, the visuals bog down the project. The split-screen shots of the highway have a very staid, Ken Burns quality to them, and feel as though they could have been produced completely independently of Stevens' music. If Stevens was setting out to evoke the odd exhilaration of urban chaos-- and he seems to have been, rhapsodizing in the liner notes about the roadway's ""steep grades, sharp turns, [and] detours... [creating] a rollercoaster obstacle course for the unsuspecting driver""-- then it's ironic that the video he's produced is completely devoid of kinetic energy. Long, motionless shots of the congestion on the BQE don't give you much of a fresh perspective on traffic; they mostly feel like, well, sitting in actual traffic. When the sun sets and we're invited to gaze upon lit-up city skylines and red suns, it's a relief, mainly because we're no longer stuck in gridlock. As withÂ Run Rabbit Run, Osso's recent string-quartet reworking of Stevens' second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, it's tough to know for whom The BQE project is intended. It seems doubtful that the work will find a second life in orchestral programs, and it feels equally unlikely that fans of any of his previous albums will be clamoring to hear this work live. As such, The BQE is probably best classified as an unusually successful vanity project, as well as evidence of Stevens' restless creativity. However, even at the close of the Brooklyn Academy of Music premiere, Stevens came out to sing some songs; one hopes that he gets back to singing and writing some more of those soon enough.","Sufjan Stevens' multimedia work inspired by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, premiered in 2007 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is released as a CD/DVD set.

You Can't Take It With You,As Tall as Lions,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a8b1335d7bf1698e9e/1:1/w_160/ba951987.jpg,2009-10-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13584-you-cant-take-it-with-you/,Triple Crown,"The 2007 television writer's strike was often portrayed in the national media as a pissing match between well-compensated TV scribes and studio fat cats, but if you lived in L.A. during that time, you'd see how its economic fallout fucked over the little guys-- obscenely underpaid talent assistants kicked to the curb right before the holidays, waiters who could no longer make ends meet once the business lunches stopped bringing in fat tips... bands like As Tall As Lions, whose pockets get hurt any time a show like ""October Road"" gets 86'd. It was around that time when I became familiar with the Long Island band's major-label debut, a record that wasn't shy about positioning itself in that easily licensed Jeff Buckley-Snow Patrol continuum-- as far as sudsy melodrama goes, it was intermittently enjoyable, but it also had a kind of Johnny-come-lately vibe. To their credit, lead singer Dan Nigro tones down the cheap seats act to a good extent on You Can't Take It With You, and As Tall As Lions are trying to incorporate relatively artier influences. But it's ambitious in the way memorizing all the world capitals is: It's the kind of busybody accrual that you really never have to make good on. It's where the eight-minute ""epic"" is called ""Duermete"" instead of ""Fall Asleep"" despite having not one word of Spanish in its lyrics. Indeed, there are plenty of points where As Tall As Lions identify what made other albums great, and you can pick out where they're seeking inspiration. ""Circles"" comes off like a Cliffs Notes In Rainbows, jumbling the beat fake-outs of ""15 Step"", a winding acoustic motif reminiscent of ""Jigsaw Falling Into Place"", and the computerized percussion of ""Videotape"". Predictably, it's a complete fucking mess of forced syncopation and aimless melody which only rights itself when ATAL settles into a straightforward 4/4 chorus that leads up to a baldfaced attempt at Jonny Greenwood's dissonant solos. ""Sixes & Sevens"" barges in ass-first with choral vocals and a time signature too complex for its acoustic strumming. The title track works in slightly Oriental accents to its harps and keys before climaxing in a chorus whose unctuous sheen might perk the ears of Mutt Lange's attorneys. You know these guys have been listening to New Orleans blues because the rank gumbo of ""We's Been Waitin'"" uses one of those telephone-box vocal effects. A quarter of ""Duermete"" is taken up by droning ambiance. Nearly everything else has some sort of backmasking effect, unorthodox percussion, and enough guitar processing effects to rival a Fennesz record-- it's overstuffed with pretty much everything except memorable hooks. As overblown as You Can't Take It With You is musically, Nigro's not one to be upstaged by guitar pedals. Throughout, he associates falsetto with passion and clichÃ© for truth-- ""Sixes and Sevens"" works in ""I've been hung out to dry"" and ""wake me when its over""; what might be an otherwise exhilarating, cracking-whip rhythmic workout (""In Case Of Rapture"") is actually bested in terms of Cold War Kids-aspiring uplift clichÃ©-- ""It's better to die on your feet than live down on your knees."" It's not their fault that Passion Pit already wrote a better song with the same title about the same thing, but if whoever's dying to the sounds of ""Sleepyhead"" pulls through, I hope they tell Izzie and McSteamy that life's too short for lyrics like ""the rhythm of your heart beeps loud until it stops and robs the room of sound."" I can't front: I actually like You Can't Take It With You more than I probably should if only because it's got such a narrow revivalist charm. It's reminiscent of that very specific span of time between 1997 and 1999 when the likes of Better Than Ezra, Days of the New, Our Lady Peace, and Live had absolutely no idea how to cope in the post-OK Computer world and stuffed their also-ran post-grunge with drum machines and talked mad shit about the ""electronica"" influence on their new futuristic concept album. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear I bought this thing at my college bookstore at a reduced New Artist price on the strength of a couple of three-and-a-half-star reviews praising its ""eclecticism,"" only to later sell it for beer money. But you can't really blame As Tall As Lions for going overboard on the studio wizardry: There really isn't too much here that sounds like the work of a couple guys jamming out in a room, but then again I doubt this would be much better if it did. Hell, cue the strings.","Working within theÂ easily licensed Jeff Buckley-Snow Patrol continuum, this Long Island band makes major-label melodrama.

Survival Skills,BuckshotKRS-One,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69f9d034d5c69bf35a4/1:1/w_160/8ab55e75.jpg,2009-10-16 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13578-survival-skills/,Duckdown,"They're both New York rap veterans, but beyond that, KRS-One and Buckshot don't have a lot in common. KRS' gun-talk credentials are straight, but he's spent most of the past two decades in uplifting political rant mode; Buck has specialized in snarling, guttural street shit since day one. KRS raps in an overactive, splenetic blurt, like he can't bear to sit down for more than a minute; Buck's one of the best ever at the ominous, low-key simmer. Back in Boogie Down Productions' prime, KRS had a regular habit of bashing old associates, whereas Buck has been with the same crew of rappers, the Boot Camp Clik, for his entire career. KRS is pretty tall; Buck is almost unbelievably short. I could go on. And yet, here they are, with a collaborative album, for some reason. Welcome to rap's inexplicable 2009. Actually, there's a decent reason for the team-up. KRS recently signed to Boot Camp's home label, Duck Down, presumably because it's one of the only places where purist NY hip hop still gets a push. And for Buck, it's an opportunity to do a record with one of NY rap's great institutions. Honestly, it's not like either of them really had a whole lot else going on. So here we go: an album of obstinate hardhead traditionalism that makes Slaughterhouse sound like Kid Cudi. KRS has spent the past decade or so kicking frantic absurdities (remember the Nelly feud?), and his music has suffered, so the hope was that Buckshot's tough, direct consistency might help bring him back down to earth. No such luck. In fact, the opposite might be true. KRS is still raring to drop nonsensical science on the masses: ""Hip hop is a new urban faculty/ A function of the collective mental anatomy."" And instead of sticking with boxcutter talk, Buck has his own dubious moments, like where he calls himself the ""dot-com don."" Even a normally impeccable guest like Pharoahe Monch can't help but succumb to the awkwardness: ""You only get one shot, get it? One shot. Meaning half of both of their names."" A pretty impressive range of guests show up on Survival Skills: Mary J. Blige, Bounty Killer, Slug, Talib Kweli, an Obama-bashing Immortal Technique. But the album is so tied to its goofy concepts that not many of them get a chance to make much of an impression. K'Naan, for example, gets to make his big appearance on the vaguely hectoring wise-old-man song ""Think of All the Things"", which awkwardly interpolates Harry Chapin's ""Cats in the Cradle"", of all things. The verses on ""Hear No Evil"" are based around the respective ideas of seeing and hearing (lots of third-eye stuff), which does not work at all. ""We Made It"" is a supremely wince-worthy would-be inspirational track, on which KRS congratulates you, over and over, for being alive. And even though they've enlisted a fairly impressive roster of producers like Black Milk and Nottz, it doesn't much matter when KRS basically ignores all his backing tracks. Survival Skills isn't without its charms. After all, countless of these guys' contemporaries have dropped off the map completely, so in a way it's inspirational to see them soldiering through their own bad ideas and diminished returns. If you're in the right mood, KRS' rabid bark can get adrenaline going no matter what he's saying, and the intentions are noble. (After all, when was the last time you heard an anti-Auto-Tune jam where someone admonished you to ""go online, look up Kraftwerk""?) Says KRS: ""Critics say you want us to chill; you old now/ But really, that ain't how I feel; I'm more bold now."" Well, no, he's not, not really. But if these guys want to keep making diminishing-return records, they've earned it. We just don't necessarily have to hear it. To catch a glimpse of these guys' past glories in 2009, your best option is still to go see them live; this is just a souvenir.","NYC rap vets offer a surprise collaboration, with guests Mary J.

Love Is Not Pop,El Perro Del Mar,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a696ea9e61561daa53d6/1:1/w_160/94dd6295.jpg,2009-10-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13571-love-is-not-pop/,Licking Fingers,"Death, taxes, and life's other inevitability: break-up records. Sad-eyed Swede Sarah Assbring already has one under her belt, if you count 2005 Scandinavian release Look! It's El Perro Del Mar! (later refashioned with a slightly different tracklisting in the UK and North America as the self-titled El Perro Del Mar). But that's the thing about break-ups and, by extension, break-up records: At the time each feels like a cataclysm to end all cataclysms, the definitive statement on cessation. Yet in light of the next one-- and, God help us, chances are there will be a next one-- all the ones before can seem quaint, trite, overblown, and anything but definitive. So it makes sense that Assbring should craft another ode to getting over it, just as it makes a certain sad kind of sense that the gal who sang of being sad all day long (and thinking about being sad all night long) and suggested loneliness can be pretty would again find herself in a position to make such a record. Refreshingly, Love Is Not Pop does indeed make what came before it seem quaint, representing a significant maturation for El Perro Del Mar both in sonics and sentiments. If Look!/ El Perro Del Mar was Assbring rebounding from a failed high school romance to the tune of a candy bender and the familiar, comforting sounds of 1960s pop music, Love documents a more complicated, post-collegiate parting of ways against the more sophisticated sounds of late nights and dancefloors, courtesy of co-producer (and Studio half) Rasmus HÃ¤gg. For one thing, she initiates this one. ""I've got something to tell you,"" Assbring begins over gentle acoustic strums and rays of synth sunshine on Love opener ""Gotta Get Smart"". ""Don't wanna make you sad."" Of course what she has to say will do just that, but like many an El Perro Del Mar song, this one adorns its lyrical miseries in only the most uplifting of arrangements. When much of the mix drops out to let Assbring deliver the kicker-- ""It hurts now but deep down inside/ We both know it's better to part than live in a lie""-- she sounds like the patron saint of mercy, and when a chorus of multi-tracked vocals arrives to invite us to ""Go on, go on, go on,"" it's as if they're leading us to the promised land. Getting dumped never sounded better. From there it's on to piano-and-groove album highlight ""Change of Heart"" and the dubbed-out midnight excursion ""L Is for Love"", its echoes suggesting the infinity of a night spent teasing apart those great questions of life and love in search of an elemental clarity. ""Love isn't anything,"" the chorus would seem to mock here. Least of all pop? Yet El Perro's brand of pop is certainly easy to love, and a cozy sort of organic warmth-- characterized by thick, resonant drums and keys, and treated guitars that seem to lurch and lumber with the slightly irregular rhythms of real life-- pervades the new record. You're just as likely to swing your hips here as to curl up with the headphones on and rock yourself to sleep. Indeed, some tracks encourage both: just as ""Heavenly Arms"" threatens to carry the listener off to Nod, the beat gets reborn in double time, complete with handclaps that make for the most welcome alarm call ever. ""It Is Something (To Have Wept)"", meanwhile, hearkens directly back to the organ-saturated devotional hymns of El Perro's previous record, From the Valley to the Stars-- that is, until Assbring and HÃ¤gg blast the chapel straight into the stratosphere with a little bit of rhythm and a lot of production pyrotechnics. They really could have ended the record right there, but instead we get an epilogue of sorts, ""A Better Love"", wherein Assbring cuts to the very heart of the other thing about breakups: namely that the loves that come in between them (how's that for glass-half-empty thinking?) only tend to get, yes, better and better. ""You deserve a better love than me,"" is Assbring's ultimate admission, and with that the break-up cycle-- as viewed from the unique point of view of the enacting party-- is complete. Whatever love is or isn't, who needs it when you've got records like this one?","After a slight misstep, the Swedish singer/songwriter makes a heartbreaking return to form.Â Studio's Rasmus HÃ¤gg co-produces.

Is and Always Was,Daniel Johnston,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ae13d1975652139235/1:1/w_160/ce66de55.jpg,2009-10-16 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13589-is-and-always-was/,High WireEternal Yip Eye,"A lot of Daniel Johnston's most vital music was recorded alone, and in strange ways. On a weight bench, most famously, in his brother's garage, with a chord organ and a boombox microphone. This was back before his bipolar disorder really exploded on him, well and truly seized into his life. A lot of that music is hard to separate from the way you hear it-- the tape hiss and the vulnerable voice, the excitement of hearing into someone else's strange, pretty world, straight from boombox to boombox. And then a lot of his most vital music has also been recorded by other people entirely: a whole raft of covers by musicians who listened to those spare weight-bench sketches, heard a ton going on inside them, and wanted to play them big-- wanted to take the sketch and turn it into a big painting or a full-color animation. In between, well, it's been dicey: Attempts to make Johnston himself mesh with collaborators and backing bands and expensive studios haven't always gone well. How do you make the big colorful painting when the private sketch is right in the center of the canvas? Often they both lose out. The biggest, greatest news about Is and Always Was is that it does it right, beautifully and unawkwardly-- something that, if I were producer/musician Jason Falkner, I might be prouder of than having played with Paul McCartney. The record avoids the old mistake of thinking that Johnston is a ""weird"" musician and therefore needs a weird backing, or that he's a ""raw"" musician and needs a scrappy one: Johnston writes pop songs and loves the Beatles, and on this record he gets the rich Beatlesque pop arrangements that are surely in his head. They even find a sweet spot between forcing too much personality into the instruments (and having them overwhelm Johnston) and not putting in enough (so that he sounds like he's singing karaoke); sometimes a little bland or obvious, but in a good spot. This is as much as I've ever heard Johnston sound not like an individual, not like someone who's being supported, but like the lead singer of an actual band, one he's really part of-- a great, strange, and ambitious psychedelic band. Even amid the grand, triumphant rock pomp of the closing number, Johnston sounds like he's really, genuinely in it. It's a happy result that should bring even more cheer to Johnston fans than the news, reported recently in The New York Times, that he has a new cat. Better still is that his songs here shine and charm in a very comfortable way. Johnston doesn't sound so vulnerable; he sounds strong. ""High Horse"", another of those songs about the girl he fell for 30 years ago-- the Ur-girl of all Johnston songs-- pairs a supremely confident melody with a bouncy arrangement that's really, really difficult not to smile at. ""Queenie the Doggie"" has him sounding reassuringly strong, too, eulogizing a pet over a vaguely Hawaiian shuffle. There's successful Johnston rock-- a re-recording of ""I Had Lost My Mind"" with big guitars arcing all around it, a pastiche of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (""Lost in My Infinite Memory""), songs with big dramatic dynamics that Johnston matches nicely. There's a punky little gem called ""Freedom"", and one called ""Fake Records of Rock and Roll"" that's like Johnston's equivalent of Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll""-- except, based on one interview quote, I think it might actually be about when you buy a cheapo release of some classic thing and it turns out to be a lame re-recording. Johnston devotees will get a kick out of it, for sure-- out of the successful merging of Johnston and a rich, full-band aesthetic, and just out of the sound of Johnston doing well and writing well, finally rocking out on the wide screen he's usually had to imagine. What's funny is that this might not make it a good spot for Johnston newcomers to start. This, strangely enough, seems like one artist where it might be better to hear the lonely, private stuff first, to see the sketch before you see the attempt to paint it large.","Jason Falkner produces the latest record from Daniel Johnston, giving the iconoclastic singer/songwriter the rich canvas he has so long deserved.

Earthly Delights,Lightning Bolt,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69db1335d7bf1698e85/1:1/w_160/8b56ccb6.jpg,2009-10-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13577-earthly-delights/,Load,"For something so simple and direct, Lightning Bolt's music is pretty genre-straddling. Ask a fan for a description and you'll likely hear more about what they do-- play loud, fast, and insanely repetitive-- than how they sound. Not so long ago ""loud and fast"" meant punk, but now those words could just as easily mean noise, prog, metal, grunge, lo-fi, even techno. Lightning Bolt's chugging riffs, splattering beats, and amplified overload contain all those styles. Often the only difference between their songs is which label fits a little more than the others. Measured with that ruler, Earthly Delights is Lightning Bolt's metal album. We're talking degrees here-- the duo of bassist Brian Gibson and drummer Brian Chippendale still prioritize speed and volume over genre. But overall, most tracks center around the kind of growling chords and monolithic beats metal is built on. Even the more amorphous songs have a distinct gravitational pull. And as with the best metal, the simple pound can be kinda catchy, driving into your brain until it's stuck there. In other words, Earthly Delights is no grand departure. But drastic change wouldn't fit this band. The whole point of their music is hypnotic repetition, magical moments sprouting from endless reiterations. They could stretch out further, but they'd likely lose access to those mini-epiphanies. Besides, there are enough bands rejecting their pasts in the name of diversity. Lightning Bolt are happy to grind out an eternal present, and few can dig deep into a moment quite like them. This time around the duo's musical shovel seems larger, heavier, a bit more able to move earth. Gibson's riffs in particular shoot straight for the gut. He's less enamored of noodly high-end runs-- though he doesn't abandon them-- and more interested in cramming thick chords into Chippendale's frantic beats. The brutal churn of opener ""Sound Guardians"" sounds like a pile of sped-up MotÃ¶rhead albums. ""Nation of Boar"" is all low-end stomp, the kind you can imagine the duo flopping some newly-grown hair to. Even on ""Funny Farm"", about half of which is a trebly loop, they become invigorated when they shift back into heavy chug. Earthly Delights isn't all metal slam. The swinging ""Colossus"" is practically a ballad; ""Flooded Chamber"" busts ears with whines and abrasions; and the most intriguing track, ""S.O.S."", evokes the darkest noise-rock moments of Japanese bands like Fushitsusha and Gerogerigegege. Throughout, Chippendale's humming vocal lines are sneakily melodic, perhaps a product of similar explorations he's done recently with his solo project Black Pus. Still, of all the Lightning Bolt albums so far, this is the one most likely to wear you out with unrelenting heaviness and elongated mega-jamming. Appropriately enough, the album ends with its longest track, the 12-minute endurance test ""Transmissionary"". By the end whatever fatigue you feel could either be the satisfaction of a hard workout or the strain of a tedious task. But it probably doesn't matter to Lightning Bolt-- they're more concerned with testing their own limits than yours, and Earthly Delights shows their career is less a series of sprints than one exhilarating marathon.","On their first LP in four years, Lightning Bolt offer a record in whichÂ most tracks center around growling chords and monolithic beats.

The Conformist,Doveman,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69713d19756521391fe/1:1/w_160/41017660.jpg,2009-10-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13572-the-conformist/,Brassland,"Thomas Bartlett is a busy guy. When he's not making his own records as the leader of Doveman, you can probably catch him playing keyboards for someone famous or indie-famous-- Yoko Ono, Bebel Gilberto, David Byrne, Antony, Grizzly Bear, and the National, to name a few. When you play with such a range of musicians, it helps to have a personal style to retreat to when you make your own music, and over his first two albums (and his full-length cover of the Footloose soundtrack, which buzzkill lawyers and industry types have forced him to stop giving away on his website), he's established one. It can be summed up in a word: quiet. Bartlett's vocal style seems to have been developed singing infants to sleep-- breathy, soft, hardly more than a melodic whisper, really. The music follows suit, but he manages to find a pretty amazing variety at a low decibel level. The guys in his band-- Dougie Bowne, Sam Amidon, Shahzad Ismaily, and Peter Ecklund-- have backgrounds in a wide swath of music including mountain folk, Moroccan trance, punk, jazz, blues-rock, avant-garde, and neoclassical, and you hear bits and pieces of all of these on the record, even as it remains resolute in its mission to remain hushed. The band's own website calls it ""lamp rock,"" whatever that means-- my guess is they're referring to the way the music spills into the room like light from an area lamp, providing ambiance and a bit of illumination. The Conformist bridges the album era and the mp3 era in a weird way-- it hangs together well, but sounds better broken down into individual tracks. When any of these come up in a shuffle, they sound great (and it's likely to sound different from whatever comes before and after), but the album as a unit requires quite a bit of patience due to its lack of peaks and valleys. The diversity comes from the backing tracks, which range from burbling, slow-core electro on ""Memorize"" to oozing, textural string arrangements that shift with GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti-ish fluency on ""Tigers"", an American Analog Set-ish pulse on ""Hurricane"" (slathered in spacey synth), and basic strumming on closer ""Castles"", which ultimately takes on a country tinge. It's hard to pick standout tracks, because the quality is as consistent as the level of intensity, meaning everything more or less comes out equal. The shifts from minimal passages to bigger arrangements and ultimately to a drum-led coda that hints at free improv elevate ""From Silence"", while Bartlett's vocal on ""The Best Thing"", doubled by a very quiet Matt Berninger of the National, offers one of the best melodies. ""The Cat Awoke"" is another candidate-- the brisk pace, led by banjo and some atmospheric guitar work, builds to a restrained climax that... well, it moves to another pretty quiet section. I don't mean for that to sound so facetious, but your enjoyment of this album will likely depend on how much attention you can devote to its subtle shifts and varied textures, as it moves from one muted moment to the next.","Thomas Bartlett continues on his quiet musical path, here with contributions from Norah Jones and Matt Berninger of the National.

We're on Your Side,Slaraffenland,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66dea9e61561daa5378/1:1/w_160/add66b3d.jpg,2009-10-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13534-were-on-your-side/,Hometapes,"""It's only a state of mind,"" went the tagline for Terry Gilliam's dystopian masterpiece Brazil. ""Slaraffenland"" is something of a state of mind, too. The word is apparently Scandinavian for ""land of milk and honey,"" and while the Danish band of the same name is hardly all sunshine, it is indeed something of a world unto itself-- a vision of musical synthesis that borrows from any number of influences and constructs those raw materials into something new. Admittedly, that describes countless other style-blender bands. What sets Slaraffenland apart is the way the collective tends to avoid easy discord and dissonance and assembles often-disjointed pieces into something downright serene, even peaceful. We're on Your Side, the group's third album, falls on the less rigid end of the chamber-pop spectrum-- downbeat but not dour, reveling in the sweet spot between structure and open-ended art-rock exploration. Put in more specific terms, the album sounds like Brian Eno fronting a more pastoral National, the familiar despondent tone and gentle melodrama of the latter intact, but the vocals a measured hum of collective call and response and warm intonation. To this Slaraffenland add unpredictable (but not distracting) percussion, mournful (but not brash) brass, and several striking but subtle embellishments ringing, swooshing, droning, and chiming away in the background, placing songs such as ""Meet and Greet"" or ""The Right Place"" in a compelling purgatory between drift and uplift. It's experimental music, to be sure, but it doesn't conflate experimentation with alienation. Even on a song like ""Falling Out"", where the band casts away most familiar pop frameworks, the track's elliptical appeal pulls you in rather than pushes you away. This holds true as well when the minimalist industrial bricolage of ""Open Your Eyes"" begins to transform itself halfway through, working toward an inspiring resolution with trance-inducing drums and a circular guitar pattern that turns the song inside out. ""Away"" ends the album on a sleight-of-hand note, like the punctuation mark to a wonderful tone poem that leaves the listener quietly pondering just what made the preceding music so special. After all, making scary noises and offering carefully crafted unease will always be fashionable. Offering something this open and hopeful, on the other hand, is a much tougher prospect, but as strange as Slaraffenland can be, there's little doubt the disc does just that. Let others point out the looming apocalypse. Slaraffenland see the massing clouds, but would rather focus beyond them, all the way to the stars.","Latest from Danish experimental chamber-pop group finds the band reveling in the sweet spot between structure and open-ended art-rock exploration.

Know Better Learn Faster,Thao with the Get Down Stay Down,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a7c0084474cd0c09f7/1:1/w_160/c31d9465.jpg,2009-10-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13583-know-better-learn-faster/,Kill Rock Stars,"Despite the first-person plural pronoun in the title of Thao Nguyen's debut album, We Brave Bee Stings and All played like a very personal, at times even lonely, coming-of-age story. That album was lively but not light, an especially exuberant celebration of newfound musical possibilities. By contrast, her follow-up is the post-party comedown, a collection of hard-learned lessons about love, sex, and human connection. Know Better Learn Faster is a more mature record, slightly disillusioned with the world, but no less playful and with no less personality. She and her backing band the Get Down Stay Down certainly live up to this album title: Know Better Learn Faster sports a fuller sound with more pop tricks and trickier arrangements that incorporate swirling Philip Glass-y keyboards on ""Burn You Up"" and Pavement slackness on ""Good Bye Good Luck"". New Orleans horns punctuate the imperative ""Cool Yourself"", and the shape-shifting ""The Give"" pairs her banjo with low guitar notes that draw out the distress in her lyrics. The band's energy rarely flags; instead the guitars grow only more manic and urgent as the album progresses. Vocally, Thao throws herself into the giddy pop of the title track and ""When We Swam"" with an abandon that contrasts nicely with the confessed uncertainties of ""But What of the Strangers"". On ""Body"" she plays the neglected woman with a wounded anger, questioning a distant bedmate while sounding a bit like Ghost of a Dog-era Edie Brickell-- no pan. ""Everybody please put your clothes back on,"" she commands on the loose, jangly ""Trouble Was For"". The things people do with their clothes off weigh heavily on her mind throughout the album, which is sure to generate unfairly prurient interest. She's no Liz Phair, though. Thao may be demanding, but she's never crude. ""Bring your hips to me,"" she sings repeatedly and flirtatiously on ""When We Swam"". She can be desperate but never plays the victim. ""What I am, just a body in your bed?"" she accuses on ""Body"", before turning that the question in on itself: ""Won't you reach for the body in your bed?"" These physical details and pointed demands pop out of the songs, evoking a situation rather than describing it outright, in much the same way Lucinda Williams uses geographical details or Will Sheff breaks the fourth wall. Know Better Learn Faster is an album of doomed relationships and what Thao calls ""sad sex,"" and she comes across as a chronicler of a scene, reporting from a circle of friends and acquaintances-- perhaps the same ones who shout the choruses of ""Good Bye Good Luck"". That communal perspective is crucial to making this album sound much more extroverted than its predecessor. Projecting outward, she conveys a warm exuberance that keeps the music spry despite the weighty subject matter. Or, as she intones by way of introducing the boogie-shoegazer finale ""Easy"": ""Sad people dance, too.""","After a personal, sometimes exuberant debut, Thao Nguyen'sÂ follow-up is the post-party comedown, a collection of hard-learned lessons.

Dillanthology 3,J Dilla,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68fb1335d7bf1698e62/1:1/w_160/0c872a58.jpg,2009-10-15 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13562-dillanthology-3/,Rapster,"You know the routine by now: Here's a greatest-hits compilation, sourced from a bunch of different albums with a couple of odd singles mixed in, which doesn't have much use to diehards and tells only part of the artist's story to curious newcomers. That was roughly the case with the first volume of the Dillanthology series, one of those technically good but still somewhat redundantly inessential compilations whose omissions defined it just as much as its inclusions. And that problem was easily solved by the rarities-packed Volume 2, which did its part by containing a whole bunch of unreleased remixes that were actually worth unearthing. With the knock on Jay Dee new jacks being that they came to his stuff only through his early-mid-2000s releases, a Volume 3 weighing heavily on that material seems even more pointless. Most of Dillanthology 3 is sourced from four albums from this decade--Â Welcome 2 Detroit, Donuts, The Shining, and the recent summer release Jay Stay Paid-- as well as a track from the Ruff Draft EP and a couple of Jaylib's Dilla-produced selections from the Madlib beat-trading collaboration Champion Sound. And make no mistake, they're all good tracks from great albums. But they're great albums that the vast majority of people with at least a passing interest in Dilla already own at least one of. Odds have it that the album in question would be Donuts, his final, sprawling sample-collage work and one of the most definitive recent examples of albums that really work best as a whole. If there's one piece of work that shouldn't be broken up into component tracks and sprinkled across a collection of other stuff, it's that one: ""WorkinOnIt"" (which opens the compilation) and ""Anti-American Graffiti"" jump out like non-sequitirs without the surrounding context of their album and get abruptly cut off with a couple of added seconds of post-track silence tacked on at the end. It feels like watching a YouTube clip of half of a dialogue scene in a feature film and then being expected to recognize how great the movie is. Granted, there are only two dismembered pieces of Donuts on Dillanthology 3, with Dilla's more single-friendly albums taking up the bulk of the tracklisting. And there's a good cross-section of music that runs a pretty wide gamut of his production techniques over the last six or so years of his life: glimmering keyboard-drenched soul (The Shining's lush Common/D'Angelo feature ""So Far to Go"" and the Isley'd out ""Won't Do""), ultra-taut funk (ranging from Welcome 2 Detroit track ""It's Like That"" to Jay Stay Paid's ""Glamour Sho75 [09]""), blown-out psychedelia (Ruff Draft EP highlight ""Nothing Like This"") and manic jeep beats (Jaylib cuts ""Raw Shit"" and ""The Red""). If this compilation has a real purpose, it does so by acting as a condensed proof that Dilla's career post-majors was stylistically liberating in a way, even as it ensured that his transition to the underground vanguard was a natural one. But what will buying and owning this collection actually mean to the uninitiated once they finally realize how vast Dilla's career was? Dillanthology 3 is an adequate primer, but a transitory one; the music on here should be plenty to convert the unconverted, but not enough to monopolize their attention once they realize just how start-to-finish great the albums these tracks came from actually are. A good solution would have been to extend this compilation past its paltry 47 minutes, get these tracks (including the Donuts selections) to flow and segue into each other, make a genuine mixtape out of it. Maybe then it could've brought some new context to some familiar tracks-- instead, it just leaves everyone who listens wanting more.","Mostly sourced from his classic 2000s LPs, the latest J Dilla comp is also therefore arguably the most familiar music and least essential intro.

Tongue N' Cheek,Dizzee Rascal,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69813d1975652139202/1:1/w_160/a918944b.jpg,2009-10-15 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13573-tongue-n-cheek/,Dirtee Stank,"On his first proper LP, Dizzee Rascal claimed, ""If I had the guts to end it all, believe I would,"" and would go on to say that In Utero is his favorite album of all-time, but I think it's safe to say that was an artistic judgment call as opposed to an endorsement of a particular career path. Dizzee's embrace of success and fame has directly coincided with his actual accrual of both, and if Maths + English tentatively sought to establish him as a globetrotting good-life playboy, Tongue N' Cheek takes that guise to its logical extreme. At first glance, Tongue N' Cheek would appear to be Dizzee's slightest work-- 11 tracks, about 40 minutes, self-released, silly title, sillier cover. Not to mention the combination of producer one-offs (go ahead and find another album with both Shy FX and TiÃ«sto), been-around-the-block singles, and ""did they clear that?"" samples that could make it come off like a placeholding mixtape. But whatever romantic vision one might have of his days of ringtone-influenced scavenger sounds, you can't forget that his work on Basement Jaxx's ""Lucky Star"" remains every bit of a high point in his early career: He sounds damn good over trashy, flashy electro that manages to keep pace with cadences as hyperactive as his own, and, above all, he's way more fun than he's often given credit for. ""Bonkers"" exhibits a deferential Dizzee offering a single, cyclical verse to serve as backdrop for Armand Van Helden's wildly distorted bass rips and drum rolls. ""Road Rage"" achieves a similar success-- despite the easy read that some form of mental illness informs the first two tracks on Tongue, they come off more like a celebration of instability. Tempo is key, though-- when saddled with Calvin Harris' straight-laced H&M disco, one feels more inclined to wiggle into a pair of designer jeans than to shake one's ass (see ""Dance Wiv Me"", ""Holiday""). What makes Dizzee such a pleasure to hear is not so much his rhymes that continue to be a selling point, so much as his point of view, which still manages to convey a down-to-earth wisdom. ""Can't Tek No More"" and ""Dirtee Cash"" might be initially notable for their source material (Aswad and the Adventures of Stevie V, respectively), but even as Dizzee threatens to get too vague with the big picture, he always finds a way to stay grounded-- on the former, he empathizes with a blueballed boomerang kid taking strange club pills to counter the numbing effect of living with his parents, while the latter comes off like a hi-NRG advert for fiscal responsibility. Call it contradictory that ""Dirtee Cash"" is immediately followed by ""Money, Money"", but even that sounds kinda reasonable as far as straight-up baller lyrics go: Dizzee boasts about having a mortgage before he turned 22, which naturally rhymes with ""blowing me like a didgeridoo."" For all its strengths, Maths + English tended to fare most poorly when Dizzee tried to meet other, barely related stars (Lily Allen, UGK) on their own terms. He's every bit as self-sufficient as he was Boy in Da Corner, but at this point, he's nowhere near as lonely. Or at least not trying to be-- it's hard to call self-explanatory party rhymes like ""Dance Wiv Me"" and ""Freaky Freaky"" morally praiseworthy (sample lyric: ""spray in her mouth and watch her kiss boyfriend""), but it's in the same vein as the pungent horndogging of Showtime's ""Girls"", in that viewing women as objects of desire instead of predatory succubi can be something along the lines of progress. Which makes ""Chillin Wiv Da Man Dem"" something of a departure. Musically, a sample of the Floaters' coke-hazed ""Float On"" skirts the cheeseball soul style of Operation: Doomsday (in a good way), but it's a homebound tribute to the simple pleasures of male companionship. It's actually kinda quaint that he can still kick a verse about the politics of Pro Evolution Soccer etiquette and all-night bull sessions, even if the track itself needlessly ends with ""fuck these bitches, I'm keepin' it real."" Amongst other things, ""Leisure"" is a catch-all boast about Dizzee's natural charisma, an ability to see beyond armchair moralizing and taking other rappers to task for being unable to do the same. But as he repeats, ""I make it look easy,"" it might just be a riposte to those who might see Tongue N' Cheek as a minor inclusion in his catalog, a quickie that won't make year-end lists like Boy and Showtime or break new ground for him as a cultural polymath like Maths + English. Yet if this is the kind of album he can effortlessly churn out at his leisure, we're in for a promising second decade of the man's work.","Dizzee's self-released dance-pop record has three UK #1 singles, but it's the album tracks that make this a worthwhile and often enjoyable listen.

Wildlife,Headlights,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a25e6ef95969320db4/1:1/w_160/6e58a2cf.jpg,2009-10-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13580-wildlife/,Polyvinyl,"The first track on Headlights' newest album is called ""Telephones"", but there are a half-dozen other songs on Wildlife that could've feasibly been titled the same. Phones are all over the indie pop band's third full-length effort: they ring with no one to answer them; calls are short and only reinforce the distance, both literal and emotional, between yourself and the ones you love. The telephone serves as the great motif and most pernicious tool in reinforcing the album's overriding theme, which is how frail, fraught, and difficult to maintain the connections are between family, lovers, and friends. You may be thinking this synopsis sounds pretty heady for an indie-pop record, especially coming from a band that rather guilelessly trumpets itself as ""Indie Rock for People Who Love Pop"" on its web site, and that made its biggest splash to date with a politely infectious single called ""Cherry Tulips"". It's actually quite easy to listen to Wildlife as a breezily low-key indie pop record if that's what you'd prefer, though that short-sells the group's admirable conceptual accomplishments. Musically, the album is largely loose-limbed and friendly, from the ringing, melodic guitar lines of ""Telephones"" to the easy sun-kissed vibes of ""Get Going"" to the almost cheekily hollow trashcan drumbeats of ""Love Song for Buddy"". ""I Don't Mind at All"" approximates the tense propulsion of Broken Social Scene, but that's about as sonically pensive as it gets. Even the group's purposefully moody musical bum trips are mostly too benign to really sting, and the album's generally undemonstrative character makes it ripe for an ignorable listen assuming you're not feeling inclined to really dig beneath its placidly shimmering surfaces. So Wildlife isn't exactly bursting at the seams with earworms, but it's a worthy achievement for taking a poignant, powerful emotional state and carrying its thread for 42 minutes. The band's bio admitsÂ Wildlife was a difficult album to make, the recording process marked by a near-total scrapping of material at one point as well as the eventual departure of guitarist John Owen. It seems this tumultuous experience-- along with other, unspecified personal hardships-- deeply affected the outlooks of songwriting principals Tristan Wraight and Erin Fein. More than anything, emphasis seems to be placed on how difficult it is to maintain friendships throughout the passage of time-- maybe it's something as simple as the fact that you're ""so far from home"" (""Telephones""), or maybe your friends are physically close, but are just ""too busy growing old"" (""Dead Ends""). Fein in particular tries desperately to break through, pratically breathless in her desire on ""Secrets"" to know another's darkest moments and deepest agonies. By the end of Wildlife, it's almost as if the effort of trying to connect and understand has left everyone emotionally exhausted-- without wallowing in nostalgia, the closing ""Slow Down Town"" muses on ""Easier times/ When your friends were around/ And they called you on the weekend/ And you knew where all the people hung out."" If you've stayed with Headlights this long, chances are when the record ends you yourself will be grabbing a phone and making a call, and hoping you don't get sent to voice mail.","The Polyvinyl band explores howÂ frail, fraught, and difficult it is to maintain the connections between family, lovers, and friends.

All the Pleasures of the World,Crayon Fields,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66a9d034d5c69bf3525/1:1/w_160/b339c93a.jpg,2009-10-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13531-all-the-pleasures-of-the-world/,Chapter,"New indie development: Tweemo wimps are getting some now. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has morphed from dorky supporting character who can't even throw his own punches in 10 Things I Hate About You to... dorky leading man fooling around with Zooey Deschanel in this summer's (kinda great!) (500) Days of Summer. Jim and Pam from ""The Office"" not only got hitched, they're already expecting. It's gotten to the point where I feel bad about my teenage cousin's romantic prospects because he started looking less like Michael Cera. The Crayon Fields negotiate the transition from virginal boys to men with rickety chamber-pop aplomb on sophomore LP All the Pleasures of the World. On predecessor Animal Bells, which introduced the Melbourne four-piece's winningly wispy take on Zombies-Byrds harmonies and Elephant 6 ramshackleness, frontman Geoff O'Connor sang, ""I want to be famous, gee.""Â All the Pleasures of the World ditches the childishness of the debut and the obliqueness of the side project without losing sweetness or nuance. Adding strings and a new-relationship glow, it's the kind of album that could make the Crayon Fields downright lovable. Reference points: the Crayon Fields covered heartbreaking New England folkie Kath Bloom as a recent B-side, and current fellow Down Under-er Jens Lekman is DJing an upcoming album release party. So on opening track ""Mirror Ball"", released on 7"" last year, the object of our narrator's affection reduces him to ""a virgin in a dancehall""; where the Velvet Underground and Nico promised ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", O'Connor reflects, ""You are still my mirror ball,"" Pavement scrawl intersecting bashful 1960s teen-pop sway. Second single ""Voice of Paradise"" starts off closer to vintage Syd Barrett spaciness, then recycles one of the previous album's lyrics, like a bedsit Kurt Vile-- all to let O'Connor's beloved know how ""lucky"" he feels. You won't gag, I promise. But you may get that feeling in your stomach like you just drove over a dip in the highway. All the Pleasures of the World is, in some ways, a celebration of hovering between two worlds. On the title track (and upcoming third single), O'Connor is too young to love, so he just loves everything. On slightly too long string-backed love epic ""Lucky Again"", which captures the embarrassing hyperbole of freshly requited adoration more accurately than I've seen outside indie romcoms, he's too young to lie about his age, but old enough to forget. And, on ""Celebrate"": ""Surely we're old enough to have plenty to celebrate/ And young enough to have more if we wait/ But let's not today."" Not a girl, not yet a woman; the innocence of classic pop, the messiness of the recent indie past. In a song title: ""Timeless"", almost. This is the one the kids who believe said romcoms will be putting on mixes for new girlfriends and boyfriends. Bells and bird chirps make it easy to picture the dawn-lit scene as O'Connor murmurs, ""When I wake up next to you, I forget I have a day to be dressed for."" The Crayon Fields could've left this one a Nick Drake strings-and-acoustic ballad. But they don't. All the Pleasures of the World is an album for people who listen to the Clientele while reading the Sunday newspaper and making tea, and it's an album for people who listen to Camera Obscura while sighing wistfully, and most of all it's an album for people overjoyed with finding themselves, suddenly, rapturously, between hello and goodbye. ""There are so many things I should've felt long ago that I'm just feeling now,"" O'Connor confesses on ""Graceless"". Hey, you know who used to sleep under a Peter Pan poster? Bruce Springsteen, that's who. Look it up.","Like an indie-pop Kurt Vile, this Aussie artist transforms classic rock touchstones into something affecting and winning-- in this case, charming indie pop.

Rio [Collector's Edition] / Live at Hammersmith '82!,Duran Duran,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a09d034d5c69bf35a7/1:1/w_160/d91994e2.jpg,2009-10-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13579-rio-collectors-edition-live-at-hammersmith-82/,EMI,"For the last 20 or so years Duran Duran have essentially been a post-fame band, racking up albums, pleasing their very devoted fanbase, occasionally trying new things, and becoming an admirable pop fixture that no longer communicates with casual listeners. Though their loyalists will howl at the notion, the Duran Duran people care about is the one that recorded Rio and drank cocktails underwater. The band made most sense at its most successful. Rio isn't just front-loaded with some of the era's most bulldozing hits, it's still Duran's best shot at an artistic legacy. Their first album was made by a group shaking off its David Bowie and Japan crushes, Seven and the Ragged Tiger was a grand and flimsy folly: Rio is where the band's hunger for success really catalyzed its mix of rock, disco, and heartthrob pop. You can't understand the 1980s without watching the promos for ""Rio"" (yachts!) and ""Save a Prayer"" (elephants!), but the album has higher peaks. ""Hungry Like The Wolf"" is the group at their most lustily, nonsensically exciting, and the self-mythologizing ""Hold Back the Rain"" supercharges the band's early synth-pop sound and strafes it with gated snare drums to magnificently shameless effect. As for ""The Chauffeur"", Rio's big art-rock climax, it's a new wave ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"": cryptic, stately, sealed into its time but defining it. Rio is, as it was in 1982, a romp of a record-- so how does loading it with extras affect that? Early believers in the power of 12"" mixes to widen a band's range and transform their songs, Duran Duran were-- often justly-- proud of the extended ""night versions"" they created for their singles. But what's on evidence on the deluxe edition of Rio isn't so much transformation as commercially minded perfectionism. With the record selling slowly in the US, they had most of the first side remixed to sound punchier and more dancefloor-ready. These ""Carnival Remixes"" sit next to the songs' UK original mixes and the Night Versions-- and in some cases the demo versions too-- and the differences honestly aren't great enough to justify listening to all of them. The 2xCD package is probably best used as a way of recreating whichever version of Rio floats your nostalgia yacht. Live at Hammersmith '82! is a different matter. Recorded that November, just before Rio's American success put Duran through the fame barrier, this CD/DVD release is a picture of a group who know they're big but are tantalizingly unaware quite how big. There's no sense of distance in Simon LeBon's enthusiastic stage banter, and it's only the extreme pitch of the screams when ""Save a Prayer"" or ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" are announced that make you realize quite how hot Duran Duran had become. More importantly, the group sound fantastic. The rock side of their make-up is higher in the mix and Nick Rhodes' synths play a less decorative role than on record, dropping back into the rhythm section to muscle the songs forward. The set throws Rio tracks in with the best of their debut album-- a raucous, proto-Britpop ""Friends of Mine"" is a highlight-- and shows a Duran Duran who clearly loved playing music together. Which does more than any number of bonus mixes to tell you how they won those loyal core fans in the first place, and why a pop band whose closest brush with brilliance was 27 years ago are still in the game.","Duran Duran reissue and expand their one truly great album, plus issue a live document of their ascendancy to transatlantic superstardom.

Splitting the Atom,Massive Attack,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a699b1335d7bf1698e7d/1:1/w_160/15b86cfe.jpg,2009-10-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13574-splitting-the-atom/,Virgin,"In a recent interview, Massive Attack's Daddy G claimed dubstepper Burial might remix the entire forthcoming Massive Attack album the same way Mad Professor remixed Protection on No Protection a decade and a half ago. That's a great look for Massive Attack; Burial's moody skitter-fog should mesh beautifully with Massive Attack's heady creep. But if the teaser EP Splitting the Atom is any indication, that Burial remix joint will probably make a better and more convincing Massive Attack album than the next actual Massive Attack album. That's not really a surprise. In the past 18 years, Massive Attack have released only four albums. And the last of those, 2003's 100th Window, was the first album of theirs to fully fade into wallpaper when you weren't paying very close attention. Since then, they've busied themselves with stuff like the score to the fairly badass Jet Li flick Unleashed, seemingly giving up on recapturing the power they once had. Back when they were pretty much inventing trip-hop, the group built bruised hellscapes out of whatever they could find: dusty rap breakbeats, film-score orchestral stabs, creeped-out 2-Tone skank. They knew just when to drop something unexpected into the mix, like the downtuned metal guitar that always raised goosebumps on ""Angel"". But on 100th Window, they stopped building tracks, letting the grooves just sit there instead. And despite the deeply impressive roster of guest vocalists on Splitting the Atom, they're still stuck in that rut-- and, just as alarmingly, so are their remixers. Splitting the Atom has four tracks: two new originals, and two remixes of new songs we've yet to hear. The title track uses the deep mutters of 3D and Daddy G and the angelic, quavery croon of reggae vet and longtime collaborator Horace Andy. The track has all the elements of the group's classic sound: funhouse organs, ""Ghost Town"" echo-rattles, organ drone, voices that just flutter in the background without ever quite revealing themselves. The lyrics evoke a slow apocalypse: ""It never stops and we'll never learn/ No hope without dope and the jobless return."" But the song's drum-track is clumsy and pedestrian, and the song doesn't move toward anything; it just plods quietly along for five minutes. ""Pray for Rain"" recruits TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe to growl stony, disconnected imagery over a sprawling, expansive groove. In its seven minutes, the song does hint at something bigger, but after the cool little Aphex Twin bleeps come in, it just doubles back to its slow beginning, repeating the whole first verse over again. These days, Adebimpe's regular producer, Dave Sitek, is way better at these nervously monolithic jams. The two remixes, meanwhile, both seem content to sloppily imitate the Knife without really indicating that the songs underneath all the spooky vocoders are worthy of attention. Elbow's Guy Garvey's mewls are barely audible on the Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid remix of ""Bulletproof Love"", and onetime Tricky muse Martina Topley-Bird growls through filters on the Flash treatment of ""Psyche"". The Knife are a good blueprint for haunted synth tracks, and the version of ""Psyche"" might be the heaviest thing here, but it sounds nothing like Massive Attack. Maybe these original tracks will make more of an impact on the actual album, but I can't see how. With last year's Third, Bristol contemporaries Portishead proved that trip-hop old heads can still make damaged masterpieces that rival anything they ever did. But Portishead did it by leaping way beyond their old sound, not repeating their tricks and hoping they'll tickle the same buttons. If the next Massive Attack album is to mean anything, it'll need to do way more than play connect-the-dots with big-name collaborators-- it'll need to tap into something primal.","Massive Attack preview their new LP with an EP of two new songs and two remixes of songs we've yet to hear-- plus contributions from TVOTR and Elbow.

The Life of the World to Come,The Mountain Goats,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63cc0084474cd0c08f4/1:1/w_160/f3799407.jpg,2009-10-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13483-the-life-of-the-world-to-come/,4AD,"It's Halloween, 2005, and John Darnielle-- preparing to lead another show as the Mountain Goats-- pulls on his costume: a priest's robe. If it's a joke, it's a kind-hearted one: Most people at Mountain Goats shows know the words and aren't afraid to sing them. Some weep while doing it. Darnielle has power over his audience, but he doesn't wield it-- instead, he posits himself as one of them: Someone moved by small stories of liquor-store clerks struggling with big concerns like salvation; a cautious optimist with empathy for the last gasp and the broken promise; someone who holds a melting candle for four-chord American folk music; a ""lyrics guy."" He sings a song about best friends whose dreams of death-metal stardom are crushed when one is shipped off to school. The story ends with Darnielle crowing, ""hail Satan!"" Everyone under the roof crows with him. Darnielle's voice swells and his face fills with light. The irony is obvious, but I don't think that's why he's happy. (And I doubt he even registers it-- during performances, he squints, bucks, shouts ""yeah!"" before just about every instrumental break, and is in general totally unselfconscious.) My guess is he's happy because he's singing about two people who have found god for themselves, even if they couldn't decide whether to call their band Satan's Fingers or the Killers or the Hospital Bombers. This is how he works: Imposing grand themes on squalor, lending dignity to those who have none, passing gentle hands over people who probably deserve the lash. He's written an album about the salvation of meth-heads and another about the bond between codependent alcoholics. Under a canopy of violins on last year's ""Marduk T-Shirt Men's Room Incident"", he detailed what was either a rape or a murder with a voice a prosecutor might point out as sounding almost sympathetic. On 2005's ""Love Love Love"", the sick feeling in Raskolnikov's stomach-- after murdering Alyona Ivanovna in Crime and Punishment-- is posited as a reflex of love. Hallmark may disagree. This keeps him honest and makes it almost impossible for him to be sentimental.Â In an interview early last year, I asked him if he loved his characters. ""I have loads of affection for them all, for sure,"" he said. ""But my relationship to most of them is the relationship you have with a close friend who you know is also a chronic liar."" These themes-- forgiveness, redemption, religion generally, and the Bible specifically-- have backlit his writing since the early 1990s, from boombox-recorded albums for tape-only labels like Shrimper to full-band albums like Tallahassee, which Darnielle started releasing in 2002 for 4AD. (I've told curious friends that his music was ""alt-Christian,"" which ends the conversation pretty quickly.) But he's never been as explicit about the Bible as on The Life of the World to Come, 12 songs about ""hard lessons"" he learned from specific verses. Thankfully he's not a pedant about it, and his songs aren't songs of praise. He's a lapsed Catholic and professed nonbeliever who told Pitchfork he still chants the Hare Krishna. He is, in his own words, ""into"" the Bible. He makes use of the book for what it is: A series of stories used to comfort and instruct us. Joan Didion once wrote that ""we tell ourselves stories in order to live."" Darnielle is a professed fan. Life's tone is quiet and contemplative. The raw-nerve hollering of his early music is gone (except on ""Psalms 40:2"", where there's a blast of raw-nerve hollering so forceful that he's basically excused from straining himself in perpetuity). But over the past few albums he's filed his whisper into a tool as unique as his shout. The cataclysmic shutter-rattling of fan favorites like ""Going to Georgia"" is replaced with songs like ""Genesis 30:3"" and ""Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace""-- in the latter (based on a verse where god promises total fucking disaster), Darnielle's narrator ties up a hostage, drives through torrential rain, shoots up in the car as the world ends, and still never breaks out of his library voice. In these cases, the music's intensity comes from Darnielle's restraint instead of being undermined it. He still drives at uncomfortable dissonance: A vandal realizes vandalism is his way of standing closer to god; someone all but sings ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" from a hospital bed. In general, though, Darnielle's presence is ruminative and gentle.Â The arrangements are simpler, too-- mostly acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, occasionally accompanied by a small string section. Sometimes, just his voice and a piano, an instrument Darnielle was trained on as a child but didn't play with the Mountain Goats until 2005. (His self-taught guitar playing was a big part of the music's primitive appeal.) Life has no marimba jollies or effects-box glitter. No reggae-esque songs like ""New Zion"" or anthemic alt-rock like ""Autoclave"". This isn't a good, bad, or even surprising thing-- its simplicity actually echoes early Mountain Goats albums more clearly than anything he's released in the past few years. While he might elicit the specific from his listeners, his music-- especially here-- is general. This is his gift and the gift of effective storytellers: to build toward the general by using the specific. Jacob works for seven years to marry Rachel. Rachel is barren. Rachel asks him to sleep with her servant, Bilhah, so they can raise children. And now there's a Mountain Goats song called ""Genesis 30:3"" about the cheeks we turn and the tasks we take on for the people we love most. In a way, it's like he's giving back to his fans or anyone who wants to listen: He spends an album relating to some of his favorite stories and tacitly invites us to do the same-- to consider what we've lived through and what we've learned. At a recent Q&A with the filmmaker Rian Johnson, who'd shot him playing Life in a Pomona College auditorium, Darnielle talked about how we'd hunted certain species to extinction, losing a relative to cancer, and valleys of paralyzing depression. He knew when to make a joke, and he made them often-- he has a really vigilant sense of humor, actually, which people who find him whiny probably don't expect. But his intensity radiates even when he's joking: One story he told involved a sound guy who'd asked him if he'd seen a particular film, and his response was, ""Does it have a guy in a hockey mask hacking up teenagers?"" The guy said no. ""Then I probably haven't seen it."" ""I'm not great with personal boundaries,"" he said later, ""so I'm sorry if I'm making anyone here uncomfortable."" Well, a little. But the discomfort isn't without redemption; it's part and parcel. It's probably what most of us came for.","John Darnielle offers up a concept album based on Biblical verses, and the theme leads to an intense collection of songs that yields more with every listen.

The Yolks,The Yolks,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6625e6ef95969320d0d/1:1/w_160/6a150d2a.jpg,2009-10-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13523-the-yolks/,BachelorRandy,"Chicago's the Yolks are garage rockers, pure and simple. They mine a familiar sound, and that almost makes it more of an uphill battle for them to stand out from the rest of the pack; it certainly makes it harder to coast by on charm. And yet, that's exactly what they do here on their self-titled full-length debut. Don't look for a ton of gravitas: the Yolks write songs about being broke, being lonely, and-- no shit-- going on picnics. What you see is what you get here, but what you get is more than just competent: it's direct, unpretentious, and joyful. Their songs are instantly hummable, played with an offhand attitude informed by punk at what feels like half the tempo and with none of the posturing. Opener ""Long Cold Lonely Night"" speeds past with the exuberance of joyriding teenagers in dilapidated cars. The song's simple lyrics have onomatopoeic buoyancy, added to by its quick downstrokes and walking basslines. Some of the band's early singles show up here, re-recorded but not losing any of their spontaneous delivery: ""I Do What I Do"" asserts individuality and bad habits in the face of clingy females, while ""Wandering"" is a simple number that dips into doo-wop for inspiration for backing vocals that are just as laid-back as the lead. The new songs show, comparatively, a bit more effort and angst, but not so much as to punctuate the records perfect lazy haze. ""Fade Away"" kicks up more dust with a far less cautious rhythm and strum and a more pleading melody, and there are hints of sweat in tracks like ""Hey Child"" or ""My Love is Yours (My Money's Mine)"", which (perhaps tellingly) is one of the few moments singer/guitarist Spencer Johnson's vocals rise above a low croon into a grittier and more insistent tone. While the pleasures of the Yolks' debut are simple, the record is still savvy. The surf-rock nod ""Sir Charles"" leaves just as much room for a muted, almost jazzy organ as it does for the guitar twang, evoking more of a luau on a private island than an open beach party. ""Rambling"" is a languid country strum that sounds blown-out and tweaked from its recording to its copious bent notes. These tracks hint that they've got their ears open and are more versatile than they often let on, and that the consistent, straightforward sound of the rest of the record is all part of the plan. Alone, these two tracks add just enough diversity to a full-length album. But even with moments like these, The Yolks maintains its amiable slacker charm throughout. ""Jane"" even hits a downright naive, innocent note, asserting that the girl in question ""smells nice"" and wooing her with PBJ sandwiches. It's almost a perfect metaphor for the record: PBJ isn't making anyone's top-10 sandwiches for the year, but where would we be without it? This music can still win listeners over, and it's a style the Yolks were born to play.","Chicago garage-rockers craft a no-nonsense album of simple pleasures that's direct, unpretentious, and joyful.

Imidiwan: Companions,Tinariwen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6805e6ef95969320d5a/1:1/w_160/fc8e64ad.jpg,2009-10-13 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13549-imidiwan-companions/,World Village,"Travel changes you. It has to. There's no way to experience something outside of the familiar and not be affected, if only in the smallest way. Tinariwen come from a people whose history is travel. The Kel Tamashek (aka the Touareg) have inhabited the vast expanse of the middle Sahara for centuries, living nomadically in a place no one else much visited, never mind called home. The area today is split between Algeria, Libya, Niger, and Mali-- modern ideas about borders and nation states leave little room for wandering peoples, and so the last few decades in the region have seen intermittent violence and displacement as they've fought to maintain their culture and lifestyle in a world that isn't built to accommodate it. Lately, the members of Tinariwen have done a lot of traveling of another sort: touring as an internationally successful rock band. It's hard to imagine any of them had any inkling they'd be performing an in-store show at Other Music in Manhattan when they formed the band in the camps over the border from Mali. At any rate, they've experienced a lot of the world outside the desert they grew up in, and it seems to have influenced the new direction of their latest album, Imidiwan: Companions. Where their last album, Aman Iman: Water Is Life, was urgent, rebellious, and wrapped up in the importance of Kel Tamashek identity, down to taking its title from the first half of a Tamashek proverb, this new one feels different in spite of only slight changes in overall sound. Recorded in the band's hometown of Tessalit in the mountains of Mali's deep-desert northeastern Kidal region, this is a celebration of a return to the desert and of the people who live there, a communal album with lots of big choral vocals and time set aside for breathtaking flights on the guitar. And so the songs largely have a little less individual punch here-- the album instead invites you into a soundworld shaped by geography. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the haunting closer, ""Desert Wind"", a whisper of an instrumental that seems to consist of nothing but the movement of electric guitar strings by the breeze. Lyrically, the songs, sung in Tamashek, visit themes of liberation and cultural-historical pride, as well as assuf, an untranslatable word with implications of homesickness, loneliness, and sadness; it also refers to the nighttime world beyond the light of the campfire. ""Assuf Ag Assuf"" lies at the center of the record's odd second half, where the intensity level rises considerably. It's one of two songs to feature a strange, ethereal expansion of the band's signature guitar sound, the lead lines sliding, reverberant, and ghostly in support of the weathered vocals. ""Kel Tamashek"" is less spaced-out, building a propulsive song around a central drone that remains pensive all through, without ever exploding into the kind of dust storm guitar outbursts you get on ""Lulla"" or ""Ere Tasfata Adounia"". It's an even sharper contrast to the positively languid album opener, ""Imidiwan Afrik Temdam"", which is dominated by the chorus. That Imidiwan doesn't quite have the bracing crunch of its predecessor is no great criticism-- this album is the sound of a band growing musically as it adjusts to its new global platform. There is a unique magic to the sounds of the Sahara. Imidiwan captures that magic with skillful grace.","Following their 2007 breakthrough Aman Iman: Water Is Life, the desert guitar band from Mali returns with a more communal album.

45 Live,Peanut Butter Wolf,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67db1335d7bf1698e3b/1:1/w_160/661413d7.jpg,2009-10-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13546-45-live/,Stones Throw,"Seven-inch records and hip hop have never gone together well. There's a number of reasons it's been a 12"" genre from the get-go, even as running times shrank from the 14-plus-minute marathon of the original ""Rapper's Delight"" to the three-and-change of ""Sucker MC's""-- the most prominent being that 45s are an absolute bastard to cut and mix. When DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist did it during their Hard Sell tour a couple years back, they preceded the show with a goofy little introductory faux-industrial short that highlighted all the pitfalls of DJing with 7"" records: less surface space to work with, the looseness of center-hole adapters, and a faster speed to try and keep up with. Now take into account the fact that Peanut Butter Wolf actually went and made 7"" edits of 18 different tracks ranging from the dawn of hip-hop to the peak of its late-1980s golden age. PBW's messed around with hip-hop on 45 before, most prominently on 2007's Yo! 45 Raps mix, but to deliberately hack down old-school hop-hop classics to bite-sized individual servings seems like kind of a weird redundancy. The vinyl version did at least result in an interesting collector's item-- a stack of newly-pressed 45s of these edits, stacked inside a PiL-style circular metal box and sold through Stones Throw's site-- yet is there really any benefit to hearing your favorite hip-hop classics, but shorter? As it turns out, there damn well is-- at least if they're mixed. The vinyl box set's an interesting curio, but the CD version's where the real goldmine is. By now it should go without saying that PBW's one of those heads who talks cratedigging but walks DJing, and his skills make 45 Live a perfectly sequenced, smartly-paced and sharply-cut love letter to hip hop across the 80s. Its 49-ish minutes are bookended with a couple of canonical favorites: Fearless Four's Kraftwerk-appropriating 1982 electro-rap classic ""Rockin' It"" begins the mix, and it's closed out by BDP's deathless ""The Bridge Is Over"", with its intro chopped and spun back so it sounds as if he's playing that breakbeat/piano loop like a yo-yo. And between those two tracks is a familiar but momentum-filled rundown of hip-hop's first decade of evolution. The old-school-heavy early minutes of the mix are maybe the most intriguing, considering that the first seven tracks-- about 40 minutes' worth of music in their original form-- are cut down to less than half of their total running time, resulting in a crash course in how electrifying and strange pre-Run-DMC hip-hop could be. The first three tracks set a strong precedent with the ""Man Machine""-sourced Fearless Four opener, the minimalist percussion-only funk of Spoonie Gee's ""Love Rap"", and the burbling disco-dub cut ""Tricky Tee Rap"" (whose titular MC, the liner notes observe, sounds kind of like current Common). There's even a ringer: Busy Bee's hilarious, ""Apache""-sampling curse-word-fakeout track ""Old School"" is a straight-up throwback, recorded in 1988 and made to sound a decade older. The transition from old school to early golden age is represented with a one-two that sets the pace for the rest of the mix: ""Sucker D.J.'s (I Will Survive)"", Dimples D's Marley Marl-produced response to Run-DMC, and T La Rock's Def Jam-christening lyrical watershed ""It's Yours"". From there on out it's a succession of greatness, heavy on Juice Crew material (""Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz""; ""Marley Marl Scratch""; Big Daddy Kane's ""Just Rhymin' With Biz""), vintage headknock (JVC Force's ""Strong Island""; Just-Ice's ""Cold Gettin' Dumb"") and a two-fer of lyrical party rap that extends outside the five boroughs to Philadelphia (Cash Money & Marvelous' ""Mighty Hard Rocker"") and New Haven (Stezo's ""It's My Turn""). So maybe the format isn't the real point-- it's the trip down memory lane that counts. 45 Live isn't just a historical look, but a personal one, too; PBW's liner notes outline all kinds of observations regarding coming of age listening to hip-hop across the country from where these singles were recorded (""I remember when KRS first came out, I was such an MC Shan fan, yet KRS was so dope, it really messed me up""), and he goes on the kinds of enthusiastic tangents you get only from the deeply committed. It's easy to look at the tracklisting, see the roster of well-loved old-school singles and shrug at its familiarity, even if it's still a treat to listen to all over again. But Peanut Butter Wolf didn't just have memories of his younger self's education in mind when he assembled 45 Live-- this mix is put together in a way that makes it an ideal introduction to vintage rap for kids who are currently the same age he was when they first came out.","Stones Throw head manages the impressive task of artfully mixing 7"" singles on this trip down hip hop's memory lane.

Live at the El Mocambo,Elvis Costello,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66c5e6ef95969320d28/1:1/w_160/5569cd15.jpg,2009-10-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13533-live-at-the-el-mocambo/,Hip-O Select,"Every new Elvis Costello album arrives with a critical assessment of his late-career eclecticism, which covers Tin Pan Alley, Brill Building pop, Southern rock, Nashville Americana, and many other ticks off his bucket list. If you're cynical, you might say he's become the thing he once railed against: an establishment artist coasting on the good will of his back catalog. If you're generous, you might argue-- fairly circuitously-- that he's simply rebelling against yesterday's rebellion. Either way, it's worth remembering that he grew up listening to Sinatra and Ellington and covered ""My Funny Valentine"" as a B-side back in 1978. Four years after releasing his debut, My Aim Is True, he released an album of country music covers. Because it came first, that angry-young-man intensity is often taken as his default setting, but perhaps Costello's punk-era sound was just another stopover on his odyssey through 20th century popular music. That breadth of interest and influence is apparent in even his earliest material: in its emphatic melodicism, in its clever arrangements, in his osmotic absorption of contemporary styles, even if they were raw (ska, pub rock) rather than refined (jazz, Bacharach). He may have been young, he may have been righteously pissed, but he sounds worldly on those early albums, and especially on Live at the El Mocambo. Recorded in Toronto on Costello's 1978 tour for My Aim Is True, the album was originally released as a promotional item, survived the 1980s as a bootleg, and finally got a commercial release as part of the 1993 box set 2Â½ Years. It's now a standalone reissue as the first installment in his new series of live reissues. This version reinstates much of the stage banter that was cut from the '93 version, including Costello's boast that he and the Attractions have come to reclaim Canada for the Crown. For an artist with so many disparate releases under his belt, Costello doesn't have a whole lot of live albums, which makes El Mocambo particularly revealing, even if it does cover only a limited set of songs. Costello here is a fierce, funny, and intelligent performer, which is certainly no surprise. Nor is the energy with which he and the band pound out raucous versions of ""Welcome to the Working Week"" and ""Lipstick Vogue"". Headlong on the studio albums, these songs are ferocious live, and it helps that they have a rowdy crowd in front of them, who whoop, holler, and call out requests for ""Allison"" (which he doesn't play). One guy yahoos so much he should get a performance credit. It's an electric atmosphere, and the setting brings out the swaggering pre- and early-rock sounds in these songs, suggesting that, even as a young artist, Costello was already fully engaged with the past. Opener ""Mystery Dance"" sounds like it was built on the same two-note guitar theme as that other Elvis' ""Jailhouse Rock"", and, on the intro to ""I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea"", each instrument seems to be playing in a different style: Bruce Thomas' strutting ska bassline throwing punches at Steve Nieve's New Wave-ish keyboard dodging Costello's swooping guitar. It's hard to keep up. These are tricky, slippery songs. ""Waiting for the End of the World"" changes shape almost constantly, as Nieve's keyboard trades off leads with Costello then ducks back into the rhythm section. And just when the setlist reaches a fevered peak, they break into ""Little Triggers"", giving Costello a surprising amount of room to croon and offsetting the reckless rush of ""Lip Service"" and ""Radio, Radio"". They obliterate the reggae rhythms of ""Watching the Detectives"" but play up the noir mood before launching into a start-stop bridge. And after Costello taunts the audience (""He doesn't think I mean it!""), the Attractions and guitarist Martin Belmont hammer away at the central riff of ""Pump It Up"" violently, growing more frenzied and frantic with each repetition until the whole show falls apart, ending with a full minute of steady clapping and calls for another encore. It's a painful reminder that Costello hasn't left us wanting more in ages.","Recorded on the 1978 tour for My Aim Is True, this live set captures Elvis Costello and the Attractions at their fierce and funny best.

Psychic Chasms,Neon Indian,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a655c0084474cd0c0934/1:1/w_160/92ae659b.jpg,2009-10-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13510-psychic-chasms/,Lefse,"""Borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered 80s."" Those words, when James Murphy over-enunciated them on what's still arguably the decade's best piece of music-as-music-criticism-- LCD Soundsystem's 2002 debut single, ""Losing My Edge""-- had the decisive feel of a gauntlet being thrown down. One 1980s baby struck back with a Nintendo Power Glove. Just a guess: Probably not what Murphy had in mind. Of course, cheaply copied reminiscences of a blurrily imagined decade are basically their own genre now, cloudy and proud. The sound has many names, but none of them seem to fit just right. Dream-beat, chillwave, glo-fi, hypnagogic pop, even hipster-gogic pop-- all are imperfect phrases for describing a psychedelic music that's generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette-oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus. Washed Out. Memory Tapes. Ducktails. Ah-woo-ooh. For Alan Palomo, reflecting on the music of the Reagan era has a personal component. The Texas-reared Mexico native's dad, Jorge, was a bit of a Spanish-language pop star in the late 1970s and early 80s. The analog electronics of that bygone period echo throughout the younger Palomo's increasingly promising previous recordings, whether with former band Ghosthustler (he wore the Power Glove in the video for their ""Parking Lot Nights"") or, more recently, on VEGA's Well Known Pleasures EP. Finally, working with Brooklyn-based visual collaborator Alicia Scardetta as Neon Indian, Palomo has brought all the best of 2009's summer sounds-- bedroom production, borrowed nostalgia, unresolved sadness, deceptively agile popcraft-- together on a single album. Whatever they owe to the past, the memories on Psychic Chasms are Palomo's and ours. Soft vocals recalling You Made Me Realise-era Kevin Shields. Italo-disco synth arpeggios. Hall & Oates drum sounds. Divebombing video-game effects. Brittle guitar distortion. Manipulated tapes that bend the notes the way Shields' ""glide guitar"" did, the way bluesmen's fret fingers did. Field recordings of birds. Oohing and ahhing backing vocals. And samples, on at least two songs, of the elder Palomo, whose electro-rock approach was quite similar. All combine on eight or nine unforgettable songs and a few tantalizingly brief interludes, indelibly capturing the glamor and bleary malaise of being young and horny as an empire devours itself. Like a low-rent Daft Punk, Palomo takes what 1990s rock fans probably would've considered cheesy-- LinnDrum and Oberheim rhythms, Chromeo-plated electro-funk Korg riffs, processed party-vocal samples-- and not only makes them part of a distinct artistic vision, but also keeps them fun. Quick opener ""(AM)"" is rife with detail, as an indecipherable tenor floats over a mock-dramatic drum fill and 8-bit star cruisers do battle against twinkling fairy dust. Another sub-minute interstitial track, ""(If I Knew, I'd Tell You)"", keeps its secrets to itself, letting multiple melodic synth lines hint at a gulf-sized pool of melancholy over a tape-altered rhythm track. ""Laughing Gas"", at slightly more than a lyric-less minute and a half, is the one that ruins my attempted distinction between songs and interludes, with bongo drums, robot vocal samples, and euphoric giggles straight out of those Air France kids' dreams. The cumulative result is a meltdown-deadened but deliriously inventive perspective on pop. ""I really hope the medium by which someone writes a song isn't the only thing the song has going for it,"" Palomo told our own Ryan Dombal in a recent interview. With Psychic Chasms, Palomo doesn't need to worry. ""Deadbeat Summer"" and ""Should Have Taken Acid With You"" are two views of the same non-endless season-- one mind-expandingly lazy and the other too lazy for mind expansion, both undeniably catchy, both earning doctorates in The Graduate school of coming-of-age ennui. The Italo-alluding title track, the New Order-throbbing ""Local Joke"", and the visceral funk alarums of ""Ephemeral Artery"" are beautiful bummers, tracks with lyrics the faithful are sure to puzzle out the way kids used to with the first couple of Weezer CDs. ""Living this way held by a single strand/ But you wouldn't understand,"" worries ""6669 (I Don't Know If You Know)"", which comes back, refracted again, as 56-second finale ""7000 (Reprise)"". If you want to destroy his sweater, hold this thread as he walks away. Overall, Psychic Chasms is something like a dream collaboration between the Tough Alliance and Atlas Sound, the latter of whose Internet-only Weekend EP shares a delinquent theme with one of Psychic Chasms' best songs. After barely a half hour, the whole thing is over, but there's enough going on in the layered electronics and enigmatic longing to make this one of the year's most replayable albums. Consider ""Terminally Chill"", which has more vocal and instrumental hooks than the average Top 40 song, but also the immediately recognizable stamp of an impressive young talent. Palomo's gear was stolen last month while on tour with VEGA, but a recent FADER video suggests he could launch a decently credible alternate ""career"" as an acoustic troubadour doing Mexican traditional songs. For various mundane personal reasons, this cassette-focused album is one of the actual CDs I've listened to most since I actually listened to CDs. A new generation's borrowed nostalgia? High time.","Beneath the hazy sonics from this bedroom electro-pop project are well-structured and highly addictive songs, resulting in one of the year's nicest surprises.

He spoke casually of physics but confessed he didn't understand everything he was talking about. (Comforting, because I didn't either.) He'd lose sight of his points and then pounce when they reappeared. His arguments weren't presented; they were splattered. One explanation for the scrambled approach is nerves, another is that it's just the way he thinks: playfully and with frequent time changes. So I wasn't surprised when I first heard his music on 2008's Dominique Leone: prog and big-budget 1970s pop like Genesis or Electric Light Orchestra shoved into a bedroom studio and butchered. It was an exhilarating, restless record; it was also too much of a lot. This tension remains unresolved on Abstract Expression. There's no space left unstuffed and no groove left undisturbed. Leone's technical feats are stunning but his musical ones are scattershot. Songs like ""I'm the Police"" and ""Reasonable Snow"" balance his little fetishes-- for bright-eyed and schizoid humor, for unexpectedly dissonant chord changes that resolve without calling too much attention to themselves-- with legible melodies and choruses. Other times, the music is annoyingly complex and the performances are buffed so hard, all that's left is bone. At five minutes, a song as restless as ""Cover Yourself"" could use an intermission. Abrupt time changes aren't necessarily a display of musical creativity in the same way that crying in public isn't necessarily a display of emotional honesty. They're extremes, which have as much to do with process as with product. And process usually affects the artist more than the audience-- the band that slaves in the studio every day for a year doesn't necessarily make a better album than the band that finishes one in an afternoon. Dominique Leone's music is complex, but sometimes it's complex in lieu of anything else, like he made an obstacle just to see if he could get around it-- and it's in those moments that Abstract Expression feels more like a private ritual or a personal reward than something designed for an audience. If it sounds like I'm coming down hard it's because I'm biased: I like that Leone is making things difficult for himself; I like that he's trying to draw a line from electro-pop to Todd Rundgren; I like the noise and the warped melodies and the feeling that I am lost in a brightly lit nightmare. Leone has worked with artists as disparate as R. Stevie Moore and LindstrÃ¸m, and his writing has revealed a taste for musical idiosyncrasies from 70s-pop auteurs like Harry Nilsson to shadow-dwellers with hilarious names like Evil Moisture (whose then-new release was described by Leone, in his ""Out Music"" column on this site, as ""unsurprisingly fucking chaotic""). Point is, Dominique Leone is doing something unique and probably knows it. If anything, the only thing holding him back is that he doesn't relax and forget it more often.","Leone's second full-length is an exhilarating, restless, and sometimes downright tiring album of schizoid avant-pop.

Good Morning Jokers,Mi and L'au,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a659c0084474cd0c093c/1:1/w_160/01caa3ce.jpg,2009-10-12 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13514-good-morning-jokers/,Borne,"We aren't used to the worlds of fashion and folk music crossing. Most ""modern"" folk artists basically look like members of Tapes n' Tapes with better flannel. I suppose Devendra Banhart had his moment, but he was hardly one of the pretty people. Consider, though, Mi (Mira Romantschuk) and L'au (Laurent LeclÃ¨re): a former Finnish fashion model (Mi) and a Frenchman who probably could've been (L'au) meet in Paris. They look gaunt, smoke cigarettes, and wear clothes that would probably look stupid on most of us. Two of their songs (""Philosopher"", ""Dance on My Skin"") have been used by Chanel in promotional materials. Not what's expected of a duo that records in cabins in Finland and hangs with Michael Gira, but Good Morning Jokers, their sophomore album for Borne Recordings, finds plenty of ways to subvert modern folk trends. The fashion links above may be a bit tangential, but Good Morning Jokers invokes plenty of artists who are visually inclined: Scott Walker, Nico, Serge Gainsbourg. While never falling in with the mumbly, ill-bordered folk music that usually comes out of Finland (see the Fonal label, et al.), Good Morning Jokers also emboldens the sounds the group explored on their eponymous 2005 debut. The songs here are almost universally more adventurous, with Mi and L'au exploring brassy funeral marches (""Bingo""), sourpuss orchestral movements (""They're Coming""), and sanguine (literally) Fahey-lite fingerpicking (""Vampire""). L'au in particular makes strides on Good Morning Jokers. No longer content to mumble alongside Mi, he shows off a reserved, expressive baritone. When he sings, slowly, on ""Vampire"", ""You're like my Lord/ Making me fly before taking my blood"" his voice contains hints of an accent that lends his delivery an internal energy. Mi handles most of the creeping, floorboard-squeaking balladry. Neither as deliberate as Nico nor as unhinged as Cat Power, Mi's timbre seems to fall somewhere between the two. She ekes out some lines that, even on an album this art-serious, can feel lost and heavy. ""I will shine in the shadows of a snake/ Crawling through the windows of the pain,"" she sings during the chorus of ""Ten Kingdoms"", and not with enough velocity or character to allow you to ignore its overbearing nothingness. That's a bit harsh, though, as throughout most of Good Morning Jokers she is tenderly contemplative and transfixed, like on ""Dance on My Skin"", possibly the year's slowest, quietest sex jam and the only one to talk about the moons of Jupiter (we need a Goldfrapp cover of this, pronto). On ""Bingo"" she is coy and dangerous before the horns steal her tune. Opening duet ""Up in the Building"" contains what might be this pair's most ascendant and plainsong melody. The remainder of Good Morning Jokers contains slight variations on the duo's frosty, slowly developing folk music, but much of it (""The Pearl"", ""Clown"") is clear and loving. From its hideous cover art on down, the album is in some ways less charming than their self-titled; bolder melodic and compositional choices can erode familiarity and polarize listeners. But Good Morning Jokers feels like a more realized, heady take on the formula, seeping, however abstractly, with the style and fashion of its creators.","Finnish duo with a flair for fashion returns with their first album in four years and it's filled with more frosty, slowly developing folk music.

Butter,Hudson Mohawke,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6895e6ef95969320d78/1:1/w_160/ecfbd2d8.gif,2009-10-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13557-butter/,Warp,"Showcasing his stuttering spin on hip-hop beats, 23-year-old Glaswegian producer Ross Birchard, who records as Hudson Mohawke, demonstrates no shortage of ideas and energy on Butter. Like the album's neon-scorched cover, which includes hawks with mohawks, he doesn't do restraint or subtlety. ""Joy Fantastic"" has to be the true over-the-top cartoon moment of the already wired debut album. Preceded by a silly skit featuring two kids whispering about escaping to a magic land, the track of sinewy, bulbous beats features vocalist Olivier Daysoul laying down some fantasyland pap that makes Fonzworth Bentley sound like a thug. He also deadpans ""You can swim the Minnetonka,"" dropping the last word like Dave Chappelle imitating the Purple One. An amusing aside on an overly precious track, it might also obliquely suggest where Mohawke is going with this electronic carnival. He gets both richer and more restless with Butter, aiming to inject more soul into his skewered style while still fidgeting through pitched-up, Premier-inspired beats, tripped-up drum patterns, and shorted-out 8-bit melodies. Hudson Mohawke already has a track record of refracting hip-hop and R&B through his own neon-colored prism. Between the re-imagined jams on the Oops EP, the Polyfolk Dance EP-- the latter named after a track by prog-rock violinist Jean-Luc Ponty-- and various singles and remixes, he's helped position his LuckyMe crew and the Wireblock label at the forefront of a multi-city axis of boundary-pushing producers. And new tracks like ""No One Could Ever"", which rolls out with dull snare taps and sped-up vocal snippets, would make fertile ground for a freestyle. Butter overflows with these kind of neon-tinted beats, almost tropical in the way they suggest warmth and sunshine (see ""Rising 5""), and deliriously happy. A teenage DMC champ, Mohawke made some initial forays into producing as a teenager by messing with the Music 2000 program on his Playstation, and it's clear video game tones and quick-cuts form a large portion of his musical vocabulary. Melody lines aren't just bright, they're blinding, buoyant, and sometimes verge on child-like. So high they sound pitch-shifted, the tracks still manage an unsteady swagger and would fit in well with Alexander Nut's recent Rinse mix. ""FUSE"" glides between pitches, tweaked to massive effect despite a lack of bass. ""ZOo00OOm"" blends bleeps, waves of bass, and what sounds like a beat boxer with a facial tic. ""Shower Melody"" soars on a virtuostic, screaming guitar riff while ""Gluetooth"" slowly bumps, chipmunk vocal chirping over a steady low-end march. His collaborations with Dam-Funk, especially ""Tell Me What You Want From Me"", are a bit more slinky, but the overall sheen is hard to escape. His wobbling, histrionic beats can also showcase his propensity for going over the top.Â Like a child on a sugar high, he dives into ideas-- short tracks like ""Twistclip Loop"" and ""3.30""-- and doesn't always follow through, taking multiple directions at once and occasionally dropping under-developed tracks, which flash and quickly fizzle without much resolution. While the album has been in the works for a while, Butter suggests he's moving at a rather frenetic pace. By the time the closer ""Black N Red"" rolls around, another bombast of tinny keyboards and chipmunk vocals, it's not contagious, it's overkill. Hudson can definitely do tweaked, but he has work to do before being transcendent.","Glasgow producer sounds both richer and more restless, serving up pitched-up hip-hop, tripped-up drum patterns, and shorted-out 8-bit melodies.

Sunset/Sunrise,The Dutchess and the Duke,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a678c0084474cd0c098a/1:1/w_160/df0a60ef.gif,2009-10-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13542-sunsetsunrise/,Hardly Art,"On the Dutchess and the Duke's 2008 debut, Jesse Lortz exorcizes his demons. With songs about his bitterness toward his mother, and painfully self-hating lyrics like, ""Don't tell me it's alright, 'cause everything inside is wrong with me,"" She's the Dutchess, He's the Duke hurts so good. With exposed-nerve sentiments married to raw acoustic melodies, it is music made by a damaged man (and his partner-in-crime, the smoky-voiced Dutchess Kimberly Morrison). It was also one of the most underrated albums of the year. Sunset/Sunrise finds Lortz in a much different place. A new father, he wrote much of the collection while his wife was pregnant. Anger, doubt, and resentment about his past is now fear, anticipation, and even a little bit of hope for his future. It is not, however, an album of domestic bliss or comfortable complacency. While She's the Dutchess matched style to substance, with minor-key Stones/Kinks grit and swagger to mirror the dark lyrics, Sunset/Sunrise finds the Seattle duo exploring murky, in-between places-- both musically and thematically. If a track has a slightly sunny energy or major-key twang, then its lyrics express sadness or, worse, icy ambivalence. ""Let It Die"" is the first song on the album to explicitly deal with impending fatherhood (""In the bed my woman lies sweetly/ With a love that I just can't see/ Inside there's a little child now/ With a heart and soul that's free""). It gallops like a cheerful sing-along, but following the description of his loving, pregnant wife is a chorus that intones how badly he wants to run away from her and the prison of domesticity. The only thing more devastating than what he's saying is how he's saying it-- set against a melody that should be a cozy, cascading love song. Usually when a band expands upon its simple, lo-fi sound on a sophomore album, it comes off sounding bloated, a blatant attempt to ""mature."" But the Dutchess and the Duke use the new colors in their palette sparingly and to a satisfying effect. Though almost every song on their debut features nothing more than dueling guitars and perhaps a tambourine or kick drum, the best tracks on Sunset/Sunrise are studded with strings, pianos, and organs that add character to their simple melodies. Album closer ""The River"" feels like a hymn thanks to its unpretentious piano arpeggios and churchly harmonies, ""Hands"" is haunted by a ghostly organ that keens behind the hollow thump of the drum, and ""Scorpio""'s call-and-response vocals are highlighted by the imitative violin line. While the album as a whole doesn't wallop the way She's the Dutchess does, its more spacious, ambiguous, and, yes, adult songs are intriguing and affecting. Repeated, attentive listens to this record will garner great reward. It's a collection for indie-rock Peter Pans, people troubled by family fissures or romantic longing, and anyone who got what they always wanted and then was surprised to find they didn't want it anymore. That basically includes most of us.","Seattle duo's sophomore effort balances the darker qualitites of their debut with Jesse Lortz's murkier musings on the birth of his first son.

Embryonic,The Flaming Lips,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66113d197565213918b/1:1/w_160/99ebcd03.jpg,2009-10-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/,Warner Bros.,"Over its seven-year gestation, Christmas on Mars had come to represent everything wonderful and frustrating about the Flaming Lips. As much as we loved the idea of Wayne Coyne producing a sci-fi flick in his backyard with hardware-store materials, the Lips' musical production became less frequent-- and less consistent-- during its making. 2006's scattershot At War With the Mystics tried to cut down on the lightness of their two previous landmark albums but was largely overwhelmed by cloying singles (""The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"", ""Free Radicals"") that felt like little more than excuses to shoot off their confetti cannons. The trio's desire to produce crowd-pleasing spectacle-- whether on stage or on film-- had seemingly taken priority over their desire to be a band. But when Christmas on Mars finally surfaced in late 2008, it came with a peace offering to fans longing for a return to the band's bizarro roots: a full-length soundtrack of unsettling instrumentals that conjured the film's icy desolation. Now, rather than close a chapter on this seven-year saga, theÂ Flaming Lips have taken a dramatic left turn with their Mystics follow-up-- the double album Embryonic is the band's most audacious undertaking since 1997's Zaireeka. The sprawling 70-minute marathon ruminates on themes of madness, isolation, and hallucinogenic horror, translating them into an unrelentingly paranoid, static-soaked acid-rock epic. Embryonic actually feels like it was produced in one of Christmas on Mars' hermetic space-station labs, with squelching equipment that takes a few moments to warm up and frequent instructional studio chatter that gives the impression of a subject under observation. There's a raw directness toÂ Embryonic that's been largely absent from Lips records since the mid-90s. For the first time in years, they've made an album that actually sounds like a band playing live together in a small room. In light ofÂ Mystics' overly processed, grab-bag quality, the holistic, audio-vÃ©ritÃ© approach on display here is remarkable-- the record is extremely dense, initially overwhelming, but unusually rewarding upon repeat listens. Like the double-disc, high-concept rock epics of yore (think Physical Graffiti or Bitches Brew), it captures them at their most sprawling and ambitious, boldly pushing themselves towards more adventurous horizons. Musically, too, Embryonic leans heavily on the Lips' formative 60s/70s psych-rock influence (like In a Priest Driven Ambulance's ""Take Meta Mars"" before it, Embryonic's formidable opener ""Convinced of the Hex"" grooves heavily on Can's ""Mushroom""), but never before has the band recorded an album so unwaveringly sinister, or so devoid of pop-song levity. (Hell, even Zaireeka had ""The Big Ol' Bug Is the New Baby Now"".) Wayne Coyne no longer assumes the role of the endearingly creaky, puppet-toting crooner. Instead, he's a world-weary fatalist describing scenes of environmental holocaust in a chillingly unaffected monotoneÂ on the rampaging ""See the Leaves"". Or he's a cult leader deviously summoning his minions on ""Sagittarius Silver Announcement"", before leading them to a fiery demise on the monstrous, stoner-metal onslaught of ""Worm Mountain"" (featuring fuzzbox-stomping assistance from MGMT). The atmosphere of dread reaches its fever pitch in the album's spellbinding seven-minute centerpiece ""Powerless"", where, over top a coolly ominous bass riff, Coyne's nervous verses yield to a Syd Barrett-on-Mandrax guitar freak out. There are brief respites amid Embryonic's thundering eruptions, but even these carry a calm-before-the-storm unease: On paper, ""I Can Be a Frog"" reads like another of Coyne's animal-populated nursery rhymes, but the foreboding orchestration and giggly background squawks (courtesy of Karen O) render it too creepy for kindergarten. And the vocoderized lullaby ""The Impulse"" serves only to make the screaming intro to strobe-lit freakout ""Silver Trembling Hands"" all the more startling. True to an album named Embryonic, there are tracks that aren't fully formed (namely, the drunken Bonham stumble of ""Your Bats"" or the free-psych splatter of ""Scorpio Swords""), but even in its slighter moments, Embryonic exhibits a renewed sense of fearless freakery for a band who so recently threatened to lapse into stagy routine. ""I wish I could go back, go back in time,"" Coyne sings on ""Evil"", Embryonic's most conventionally Lips-ian ballad, but the nostalgic impulse is immediately undercut by the admission that ""no one really ever can."" Perhaps Coyne is anticipating the confused reactions of recent Lips converts expecting more life-affirming anthems along the lines of ""Do You Realize??"" or ""Race for the Prize"". But given the band's history, Embryonic's sea change arrives right on time to herald a new Flaming Lips for a new decade. Back in 1990, In a Priest Driven Ambulance signaled the Lips' transformation from garage-punk misfits into a splendorous, kaleidoscopic rock outfit; 1999's The Soft Bulletin reconfigured them once again into a sophisticated, sincere symphonic-pop troupe bestowed with increasing commercial acclaim and street-naming ceremonies in their honor. We can only hope that, as we enter the 2010s, Embryonic portends yet another new phase for the Flaming Lips-- one that's equally as improbable and rewarding as the ones that have preceded it.","In a shocking turn, the Flaming Lips offer their most audacious undertaking since Zaireeka, an unrelentingly paranoid, static-soaked acid-rock epic.

DJ-Kicks,Chromeo,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68cb1335d7bf1698e5a/1:1/w_160/86711212.jpg,2009-10-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13561-dj-kicks/,!K7,"Popular opinion of Chromeo is understandably divided. You'll hear every kind of appraisal of their synth-soaked music: ""too hipster,"" ""too coked-out,"" ""too ironic,"" even ""too fratty."" On the contrary, they're mostly just big nerds, gobbling old-school records with aplomb. Hell, band member and hip-hop devotee Dave 1's day job is in academia, teaching French to Columbia undergrads. The duo, originating from Montreal, obsessively charts a constellation of synthesizer-fueled funk and dance-pop out of the 1980s, with old-school hip-hop serving as a guiding compass. Sure, they aren't especially innovative, and their associations with Vice Records and Brooklyn might falsely indicate that their 80s night hokum is all a big put-on. Chromeo's entry into !K7's DJ-Kicks, the 30th in the storied mixtape series, seems acutely aware of the distinction. Filled with early-80s funk and R&B-infused pop (including bygone classics like Cheri's ""Murphy's Law"" and Val Young's Rick James produced ""Seduction""), the disc serves as a legend for Dave 1 and bandmate P-Thugg's musical evolution. At the same time, it captures the nexus in funk, pop, and synthesizer-based music that coalesced in the early 1980s around the time ofÂ Thriller. Michael Jackson, unsurprisingly, doesn't make an appearance on the disc, but his 80s work acts like a set of parentheses around the record, contextualizing the late-70s blue-eyed disco of Leo Sayer with the late-term vocoder stylings of quirky Quebecers Soupir. Oh, and in keeping with DJ-Kicks tradition, Chromeo cover the Eagles. Like Hot Chip's recent, superior entry in the series, Dave 1 and P-Thugg craft the mix as a personal biography.Â But where Hot Chip seamlessly weave incongruity into a glittering tapestry of affectations, Chromeo downplay the pillow-talk wit that marks their original works. Any indication of cheeky sexuality demonstrated in ""Tenderoni"" or ""Bonafied Lovin'"" is rolled back to the come-hitherisms laid bare in the freshly post-Sexual Revolution 70s. As a result, DJ-Kicks almost academically picks apart enlightening standouts from the era of the duo's pop awakening, but unlike the group's best work, the mix tongue-ties the group's collegial motor-mouth. The best indication of the boys' amateurish charm is unfortunately found in how they've mixed their picks: Let's just say Chromeo aren't gonna win any professional DJ awards. You could thus take the skeptic's route and argue that the disc only reinforces the duo's ineffectual irony: an awkwardly paced set of also-rans from the rough-and-tumble end of the disco era. However, these ""also-rans"" reflect a poorly marked through-way in the development of modern pop music, re-affirming Chromeo as quirky but devoted pathfinders. The only thing that seems clear is that you can't separate Chromeo from their early-80s record bins, so you pretty much gotta take it or leave it.","The 30th entry into !K7's storiedÂ DJ-Kicks series comes from Vice's Chromeo, so it's not surprising it's filled withÂ funk and R&B-infused pop.

Death Acoustic,Nick Oliveri,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68eea9e61561daa53c7/1:1/w_160/316dedee.jpg,2009-10-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13567-death-acoustic/,MVD AudioImpedance,"Before getting booted from riff monsters Queens of the Stone Age in 2004, following their breakout Songs for the Deaf, the goateed, often-nude Nick Oliveri was one half of the group's core duo-- alongside frontman Josh Homme, an anchor at the center of a rotating cast of contributors. Oliveri served as the band's sparkplug, counterbalancing Homme's melodic falsetto with his screeching hardcore vocals and adding a degree of batshit craziness to songs like ""Tension Head"" and ""Quick and to the Pointless"". Oliveri's absence would take its toll on Queens-- they haven't reached the same heights without him on subsequent records Lullabies to Paralyze and Era Vulgaris. Since that time, Oliveri has played in a slew of bands including the Dwarves and L.A. hard-rock outfit the Knives and continued work on his long-running punk-metal project Mondo Generator, but has remained mostly out of the spotlight by comparison to his ex-bandmembers. (Even lesser known guitarist Dean Fertita has gone on to work with Jack White in the Dead Weather.) Now comes Death Acoustic-- as its title implies, a stripped-down solo album-- featuring a straightforward combination of Oliveri's gutter-punk howl and acoustic-guitar strumming. Despite these simple elements, the album features the same brutality and hostility as his contributions to Queens and other groups, and offers a bleak, sometimes frightening character portrait of Oliveri as an outcast not fit for normal society. Death Acoustic is a pretty strange record and there isn't much precedent for it beyond perhaps the outlaw country of singers such as Hank Williams and Waylon Jennings, men who sold the idea of themselves as kinds of modern-day desperados. The difference, I suppose, is that Oliveri seems to actually be that character in real life, and when he delivers lines like, ""I use crystal methane by the boatload/ I live off straight booze, I just don't fucking care,"" in the G.G. Allin cover ""Outlaw Scumfuc"", you don't really question the validity of that statement for a second. In one sense these songs are effective, as the listener gets some insight into Oliveri's persona, but the material is so violent and misogynistic it makes it difficult to find a way in. But beyond the lyrical content are songs with real structure and melody that reinforce what made Oliveri an integral part of Queens in the first place. His guitar playing is tight and forceful throughout, and his cover of the Misfits classic ""Hybrid Moments"" is tender and even pretty, with double-tracked vocals that add nuance to the song's simple blitzkrieg bop. Even the stripped-down rendition of ""Gonna Leave You"" from Songs for the Deaf included here serves as a reminder of what a potent combination he and Homme were back in the day. It's enough to make you long for a Queens reunion, but it's darn-near impossible to imagine Homme listening to Death Acoustic and hearing the sentiments of a changed man.","As its title implies, this is a stripped-down solo album from the former Queens of the Stone Age co-leader.

Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6885e6ef95969320d73/1:1/w_160/7f3bfc8f.gif,2009-10-09 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13555-ciao-my-shining-star-the-songs-of-mark-mulcahy/,Shout! Factory,"So who the heck is Mark Mulcahy, and why does he have so many famous friends? I can't totally answer the second question, but for the first, go seek out ""Hey Sandy"" by Polaris, put it on, and come back. I'll wait. ... Ah, you're back. Did you go on a four-hour Super Mario Kart and Mountain Dew binge? Yeah, me too. ""Hey Sandy"" is better known as the theme song from ""The Adventures of Pete & Pete"", and Polaris was Mulcahy's band, a spin-off from his earlier and far more well-known band, Miracle Legion. Since the glory days of ""Pete & Pete"", he's also put out a few micro-run solo records and has co-written a couple of musicals. But that all still doesn't explain why Mulcahy's catalog would get the starpower treatment, and sadly, the reason lies less with his music than with his personal tragedy. A year ago, Mulcahy's wife Melissa died suddenly, leaving the singer-songwriter to raise twin three-year-old daughters alone. Thus, Ciao My Shining Star is both a tribute and a kind of collective patronage for Mulcahy's career, intended to give him the funds carry on as both single father and musician. It's a touching story, lent extra power by just how many big names-- including Thom Yorke, Frank Black, Dinosaur Jr., Michael Stipe, the National-- turned out. Apparently, the response was so strong that this 21-track album accounts for just over half of the music received; 20 more tracks will be released digitally. But warm, fuzzy feelings aside, there's a musical problem at the core of Ciao My Shining Star that I hope I'm not fast-tracked to hell for having the audacity to mention-- the source material isn't really fertile ground for tribute. Emotional ties to ""Pete & Pete"" aside, Miracle Legion/Polaris/Mulcahy fit pretty squarely into an early 90s college-rock mold-- jangly guitars, nasal vocals-- that produced hundreds of similar-sounding bands. Try as I might, I can't really see what might set Mulcahy's music apart from the pack; some of the production on his last solo LP, In Pursuit of Your Happiness, pushes into the homemade psychedelia of an act like Sparklehorse, but the machinery under the hood of the songs themselves are largely generic-brand. Still, that's not a dealbreaker for a tribute album-- Mulcahy's songs are a kind of blank coloring book for contributors to fill with their own set of Crayolas. And the start of Ciao My Shining Star offers a few examples of that approach working. Yorke's ""All For the Best"" has the same itchy, chattering sensations of the bulk of his solo work, but as he is forced to wrap his voice around lyrics that are far more direct and domestic than anything he'd write himself, Yorke (harmonizing with his brother Andy) sounds warmer than ever. The National definitively put their own stamp on ""Ashamed of the Story I Told"" with a rumbling cello and plenty of low piano notes, and Frank Black turns ""Bill Jocko"" into a desperate stomp that is heart-wrenching giving the album's backstory-- howling ""Why do I have to stay here?/ Why does she get to go?"" over a deranged organ. But the majority of the record is given over to singer-songwriters covering a singer-songwriter, and adding all the creative touches you'd expect from somebody who performs under their own name. This stretch is split between people I've never heard of (Frank Turner, Chris Harford, David Berkeley) and people I thought had given up (Josh Rouse, Ben Kweller, Hayden). All do as little as possible with the source material; only Elvis Perkins' dashed-off but soulful ""She Watches Over Me"" and Fountains of Wayne's Chris Collingwood (who draws the catchy ""Cookie Jar"") impress. So while Ciao My Shining Star is a sterling piece of charity, a post-millennial Sweet Relief, it's also a bit of a slog to sit through, unless you're a loyal regular at your local coffee shop's open mic night. By all means, drop 99 cents here and there to fill out your Radiohead and R.E.M. solo-project collections and throw a few more dollars to this good cause. But there's no need to subject yourself to 40 tracks and two hours of unexceptional covers in the process.","Thom Yorke,Â Michael Stipe, the National, and Dinosaur Jr. turn out for this charity tribute to the man best known for the theme song to ""Pete & Pete"".

Never Cry Another Tear,Bad Lieutenant,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68dc0084474cd0c09be/1:1/w_160/26105413.jpg,2009-10-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13563-never-cry-another-tear/,Triple Echo,"New Order may be gone, but it'll take a while before any of their members' follow-up bands feel like more than side projects. A group like Bad Lieutenant-- including Bernard Sumner and latter-day Order member Phil Cunningham, with Stephen Morris also on hand-- is always going to be compared, rather than considered. In that sense-- and that sense only-- it's a good thing Never Cry Another Tear is such an unassuming album: It's so breezily unambitious as to make the comparison feel unfair, even when you can't avoid it. It's all too common for famous musicians to talk about how they made a record mostly for their own amusement, but this album really does feel like that: relaxed, not overthought, indeed hardly thought at all. Sumner, guitarist Cunningham, and third key member Jake Evans are happy to share your attention, even if it means everything on the record is a minute too long to keep it. ""Running Out of Luck"" starts purposefully and wanders happily away into indifferent jangle-rock; ""Head Into Tomorrow"" switches wistful guitar figures for draggy vocals from Evans. It's as if the musicians are passing the spotlight between them like a game controller-- Not sure how to do this bit. Fancy a go, mate? With the electronics mostly set aside for an album Sumner is making with Jacques Lu Cont, what Bad Lieutenant have to offer is guitar rock. A specifically British strain of guitar rock, in fact, with the rhythm section sidelined and the guitars themselves often blending into a mid-range soup with keyboards and backing vocals. It's been one of the staple sounds of UK music-- and specifically Manchester music-- since Britpop-- and songs like ""Runaway"" and ""Shine Like the Sun"" are steeped in it. You can hear echoes here of James, latter-day Oasis, and John Squire's Seahorses. Grim names to invoke, and thankfully Bad Lieutenant aren't fully in that leaden company-- Sumner's offhand anti-charisma means the record never strains for effect when he's singing, and there's at least one pretty idea in every song, even if it usually gets drowned. The moody, Doves-ish ""Twist of Fate"" and the thoughtful ""Dynamo"", with its ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" keyboard, are the best and most coherent things here. ""Summer Days on Holiday"" is more typical, though. It has Sumner's best performance on the album, filled with enigmatic threat. But that gets lost as the verses slide into one of those functionally soaring Britrock choruses, and both sit badly with the record's most pointlessly pyrotechnic guitar work. Underpinning it all is perhaps the thinnest drum sound Stephen Morris has ever been near. Like most Bad Lieutenant tracks, it never quite coheres. Of all the former New Order members, Sumner has (thanks to Electronic) the best track record outside the band, but Bad Lieutenant are strolling along a familiar road here: like previous breakaways Monaco or the Other Two, this record meanders through a set of passable songs that ultimately decline to move or enthrall you. It's another chance, I guess, to reflect on the curious workings of gestalt and the casual, inscrutable heartbreak these people could create together. Sumner and Morris helped make some of the greatest popular music of the late 20th century: They have nothing left to prove, but does that have to be so obvious?","Ex-New Order members Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris, and Phll Cunningham unveil their new project.

Scars,Basement Jaxx,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65ec0084474cd0c0948/1:1/w_160/e0b72ab5.jpg,2009-10-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13519-scars/,XL,"In a recent post to his blog on the New Yorker website, the critic Sasha Frere-Jones made a case for his poor track record in predicting public taste by pointing out that he had Basement Jaxx, not Daft Punk, pegged to be a major crossover act at the start of the decade. His reasoning was that, while Daft Punk mined a fairly narrow robot-funk aesthetic, Basement Jaxx emphasized human voices and cherry-picked sounds from a wide range of genres, which should logically open them up to a broader audience. The opposite was true. Whereas Daft Punk's M.O. was consistent and instantly understood, Basement Jaxx's style was constantly shifting and lacked a public face. The duo may have produced some of the most transcendentally brilliant dance music of the decade, but their eclectic taste and resistance to shtick may well have kept them from attaining widespread commercial success. Basement Jaxx's aesthetic is easy to intuit, but difficult to describe. The word ""maximalist"" gets thrown around a lot, but that implies a musical overkill that belies Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe's talent for precisely calibrating their tracks for an over-the-top boldness. Their most memorable songs-- ""Where's Your Head At?"", ""Romeo"", ""Lucky Star"", ""Red Alert""-- are pummeling, relentless pleasure machines, and even when they dial it down for a melancholy tune like ""Take Me Back to Your House"", the duo still aim for an overwhelming effect. Scars, their fifth album, mostly falls into this latter category, and the results are mixed. Fans hoping for some good ol' Jaxx floor-fillers will almost certainly be disappointed, as only the first single ""Raindrops"" fully delivers the blissful catharsis of their best-known hits. The remainder of the album lingers in a sad-eyed funk even when the group is clearly shooting for fun, uptempo party tunes. The most successful songs on Scars foreground the romantic anxiety that permeates the entire album. ""Feelings Gone"", featuring vocalist Sam Sparro, and ""My Turn"", a collaboration with Lightspeed Champion, both expand upon the lovesick sound of Crazy Itch Radio's ""Take Me Back to Your House"", but jettison that song's quasi-country affectations and air of lonely desperation in favor of bright, buoyant arrangements similar to their more upbeat numbers. There is a potent sadness in these tracks, but any trace of self-pity is overshadowed by the way the vocal performances and the sound of the music come together as an open-hearted plea for affection and understanding. These two songs, along with the more mellow cuts ""A Possibility"" and ""Stay Close"", invert the expectations of Jaxx music, but play to the duo's strengths as composers. They may not overload the listener with euphoria, but the songs evoke a powerful emotional urgency, and that more than anything else defines Buxton and Ratcliffe's best work. This is evidence of true artistic growth, but these successes share space on Scars with creative cul-de-sacs and uninspired genre exercises. The title track establishes the dark tone of the album, but it is almost too effective in the way it applies the Jaxx production aesthetic to conjure nausea-inducing anxiety. The Santigold showcase ""Saga"" falls into a similarly tense zone, but its overly dense ragga is saved by the bounciness of its catchy, taunting refrain. These are fine pieces of work, but they are more interesting than pleasurable. Nevertheless, when the two try for uncomplicated, pleasurable dance anthems, the results are rote and boring. ""What's a Girl Gotta Do?"" comes off like a second-rate retread of ""Do Your Thing"" from Rooty, the Yoko Ono collaboration ""Day of the Sunflowers (We March On)"" is energetic but joyless, and ""Twerk"", their team-up with Yo Majesty, hinges on an interpolation of ""Maniac"" from the Flashdance soundtrack that is far too cheap and easy for a group capable of so much better than kitschy nostalgia. As much as ""Feelings Gone"" and ""My Turn"" emote with genuine feeling, these songs seem distracted and unfocused, as if Buxton and Ratcliffe are going through the motions while their hearts and minds are somewhere else entirely. All of this highlights perhaps the most crucial difference between Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx: While Daft Punk have not budged from an image established in the late 1990s, have released only three studio albums over the past 13 years, and have been mostly coasting on the success of a record from 2001, Basement Jaxx have never been still for long, and seem entirely unafraid of failure. They are constantly striving and experimenting, and when you're brave enough to take artistic risks, you're bound to turn out a dud here and there. All of Basement Jaxx's missteps to date have been noble in ambition and easily forgiven when you take into account that the same impulses that produce an awkward misfit of a song like ""She's No Good"" also yield the glorious house psychedelia of ""Raindrops"". Basement Jaxx may not have a strong brand identity, but their eagerness to toy with their formula and broaden the emotional range of their material is truly inspiring, and sometimes that matters much more than being popular and influential.","The eclectic dance duo dial it back a bit on the most effective parts of their latest album.

Magic Neighbor,Lisa Germano,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65aea9e61561daa5355/1:1/w_160/160e9587.jpg,2009-10-08 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13515-magic-neighbor/,Young God,"There's glum, and then there's Lisa Germano glum, a sort of wry reaction to bearing the heavy weight of the world mingled with the realization that life might not get much better. It's not totally without hope, but it is the weary sound of real life pressing down from all sides, unfiltered through the usual irony and dramatic stylistic flourishes. It's often not exactly fun, either, and while Germano may rue the comparison, it's hard to jibe her work as a solo artist with the image of her fiddling away exuberantly in John Mellencamp's ""Paper in Fire"" video. Still, that was a lifetime ago, and since then Germano has come to occupy her own little niche. No surprise that the clouds don't part on Magic Neighbor, Germano's eighth record, or that the woozy gloom hasn't made way for sunbeams and rainbows. Even so, some of the gauze has lifted, especially compared to Germano's last couple of releases. With her piano and vocals at the fore, Germano finds plenty of room to toy with the arrangements, filling the empty corners of each song with small but sympathetic sonic details and a warmth and playfulness that she's not always transmitted from her occasionally spectral remove. ""Marypan"", an instrumental, begins like an overture, its questioning melody the perfect introduction to Germano's warped but not unwelcoming world. ""To the Mighty One"" features Germano teetering between childlike wonder and grown-up melancholy, the tonal unease enhanced by wobbling organ, piano, and what sound like outer space effects beamed in from the margins of the mix. ""Simple"" continues this exploration of contrast, its almost bluesy beginning giving way with little warning to a sprightly carnival waltz. Following ""Kitty Train"", another wistfully evocative instrumental interlude, ""The Prince of Plati"" resumes the bittersweet dance of innocence and experience, with Germano occupying a tough to pin down (but no less effective) emotional ambivalence summed up by the deceptively paradoxical line ""You seem so unhappy; I can't take that today."" Which leaves Germano feeling... where? Up? Down? It's unclear, but it's intriguing, as is Germano's decision to bury her already mumbled, muffled, and eventually manipulated mantra-like vocals in ""Suli-mon"" until she's just another layered exotic instrument. Things are more clear on ""Snow"", where what could be Germano's feet pumping at the pedals of her piano comes across like a distant heartbeat, and Germano herself sounds almost like she's singing her near-whispered vocals right into your ear. Elsewhere, the swirling Omnichord of ""Painting the Doors"", with its surreal lyrics, may be no less strange and mysterious than the purr of a cat, but they're just as inexplicably comforting. This occasionally awkward intersection of intimacy and elusiveness pervades the disc, just as it pervades Germano's other high-wire-act works, but this time the end effect is oddly inviting. It's almost as if we're being allowed a glimpse into a blurry movie flickering away in Germano's head, projected sans subtitles and its plot obscured, yet somehow no less affecting for it.","While characteristically downcast, the eighth album from Germano lifts some of the gauze and exhibits a bit more warmth and playfulness.

Zero to 99,Boston Spaceships,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6879d034d5c69bf3566/1:1/w_160/e6300ba6.gif,2009-10-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13554-zero-to-99/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","It is somehow 2009, five years on from the dissolution of lo-fi heroes Guided by Voices and at least 10 since the agreed-upon peak of his powers, and Bob Pollard's making some of the best music of his life. Three albums deep into the Boston Spaceships and the prolific songwriter is on a tear to rival a few of his best-ever runs. One wonders if the nascent lo-fi revival has lit a fire under the dude after being relegated for much of this decade to the lower rungs of indie favor. Last fall's first Spaceships touchdown Brown Submarine was good, this spring's Planets Are Blasted was great, and this summer's fine Elephant Jokes seemed imbued with an energy leftover from the obviously fruitful Spaceships sessions. Now, in Zero to 99, we've yet another winner. Zero to 99 starts with ""Pluto the Skate"", a squelchy GBV rarity old enough to be bar mitzvahed. Pollard's long dipped into his vast back catalog for new releases, but ""Pluto"" further illustrates just what a good thing Bob's got going in fellow Spaceships Chris Slusarenko and John Moen.Â Slusarenko and Moen seem to know just what Pollard needs, and their efforts whittle down some of his eccentricities and aversions to editing.Â The pre-Spaceships ""Pluto"", for example, is skeletal, sludgy, decidedly lo-fi, and little more than a sketch; the one on Zero to 99 trades analog hiss for a juicier Steve Albini-esque squirm, doubling the volume and intensifying the central squish into the gnarled metal of a car crash. To date, the Spaceships have largely played up Pollard's fondness for chunky riff-pop to fine effect; it's nice to hear them going at a weird one from back when, and nicer still to hear them pull it off. That notwithstanding, Zero to 99 is by and large a power-pop record in the vein of its two predecessor: catchy-as-hell cracklers peppered with form-fitting arrangements and an emphasis on Pollard's impressive pipes. What separates the Spaceships songs from much of Pollard's previous work is the tunes feel fully formed; running times hang out around the three-minute mark, verses bleed into choruses and back into verses, and there's a distinct feeling between one track and the next often lacking in Pollard's more sketchbook-like records. Pollard has run into trouble when he veers towards more conventional song structures-- we might call this ""doing the collapse""-- but there's a shapely quality to the Spaceships' melodies that never belies their quirk. That's as true as ever on Zero to 99, particularly in its first five tunes; after ""Pluto"", set highlight ""How Wrong You Are"" feels like a pile of hooks, the sturdy ""Radical Amazement"" builds to a fine little point, thrashabout ""Found Obstruction Rock N' Rolls"" is simple but effective, and ballad ""Question Girl All Right"" is puzzlingly affecting. Things get a tad messier around Zero's midsection; despite an assist from R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, ""Let It Rest for a Little While"" doesn't do much to distinguish itself until Bob takes the chorus from a whisper to a scream, ""Psycho Is a Bad Boy"" seems to favor attitude over aptitude and underutilizes its horn stabs, ""Godless"" goes nowhere (although to its credit, it gets there quick), and ""Meddle"" thuds along unremarkably.Â Zero picks up again with the gallant ""Go Inside"", peaks anew around ""Exploding Anthills"" (the chorus, after all, is ""I've been drinking,"" a Pollardian statement to rival any other), and finishes strong on the back of the bitter ""The Comedian"" and the short, sweet ""A Good Circuitry Soldier"". I can't believe I'm writing this about Robert effing Pollard, but if anything, consistency proves Zero to 99's greatest flaw. Brown Submarine and Planets Are Blasted took more risks and accordingly felt more rewarding; beyond ""Pluto"", Zero's not exactly a bushwhacker, and while the songs are by and large strong and the performances uniformly top-notch, there's a slight whiff of sameyness to the proceedings here that could stand just a little shaking up. If you've heard the last couple of Spaceships records-- and you oughta-- you'll find Zero to 99 pleasant but not particularly surprising, and even the high points don't tower quite like those of its predecessors. Still, weakest Spaceships LP though it may be, as a Pollard-related record in the aughts, Zero to 99 stands pretty tall.","Robert Pollard quietly continues his excellent 2009 with another often-rewarding Boston Spaceships release.Â R.E.M.'s Peter Buck guests.

Childish Prodigy,Kurt Vile,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66fc0084474cd0c0978/1:1/w_160/67594917.jpg,2009-10-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13535-childish-prodigy/,Matador,"Philadelphia singer/songwriter (and owner of one of the best rock names around) Kurt Vile is part of a group of newcomers to Matador, an intriguing freshman class that also includes spooky synth-poppers Cold Cave and sunny new romantics Girls. But Vile differs significantly in style from these other acts, with a sound that draws heavily on the road-weary classic rock and folk of Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and even Tom Petty, but is constructed with the lo-fi bedroom-recording techniques of someone like Ariel Pink. His two albums released in the last year (Constant Hitmaker and God Is Saying This to You) felt comfortable and well-worn like an old pair of jeans and produced a summer jam last season with the very catchy ""Freeway"". But with an increased profile, the stakes are a bit higher for Childish Prodigy, his first Matador release and a record that offers some noticeable differences in sound and approach from his previous two. About half of the songs here are recorded in the same manner as before-- Vile on his own-- but for the remaining tracks he's brought in his touring band, the Violators, to flesh them out with additional instrumentation, creating some more depth and balance. The other key distinction is that Vile has opted for a much cleaner sound this time around, mostly doing away with the scuzz coating of past jams (though traces of distortion still remain here and there) and, as a result, Childish Prodigy feels more straightforward, perhaps even more professional in certain ways. While I wouldn't criticize anyone for wanting to work outside the confines of lo-fi, it's not always the best look for Vile, as the added sheen draws away some of the charm of his earlier work. Regardless, he displays the same unique ability to tap into the feeling of classic rock-- the familar, comforting quality of that music embedded in anyone who grew up with a radio-- and the best songs here, most of which come during the record's stronger front half, play off that with a punk spirit. Opener ""Hunchback"" invites the full band in for some swampy stoner-rock boogie while the janglier, almost country-western ""Overnite Religion"" locks down a solid, melodic groove. Others, like ""Blackberry Song"", succeed with simple strumminess, but eventually the record begins to veer off course around the midway point. One gets the sense that Vile is a prolific songwriter, able to knock out a bunch of tracks in one sitting, and almost all of Childish Prodigy has an on-the-fly nature to it, almost as if he's making the tracks up as he goes along. Sometimes that's impressive, like on the repetitive krautrock-arranged ""Freak Train"", but there's an amorphous quality to these songs that can also make for a difficult listen. Vile lets his guitar and vocals ramble throughout tracks, usually without breaking for a chorus or momentum shift, and lesser material like ""Heart Attack"" and ""Amplifier"" suffers, feeling meandering and structureless. This imbalance feels even more evident when he offers up a song like ""He's Alright"", with its acoustic guitar and pedal steel flourishes, that works great for its directness. Vile certainly has the talent and ability to churn out tunes, and with a little focus and editing his best batch is most likely ahead of him.","Drawing heavily on road-weary classic rock and folk-rock, Kurt Vile makes the leap from lo-fi all-star to Matador's impressive class of 2009.

Fluorescent Black,Anti-Pop Consortium,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6869d034d5c69bf3563/1:1/w_160/2b873e45.jpg,2009-10-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13559-fluorescent-black/,Big Dada,"Even with the 10th anniversary of their debut album around the corner, it seems silly to ponder Anti-Pop Consortium's place in hip hop. Name, sound, rhyme style, lyrical content, release sleeve iconography: Anti-Pop were stylized (by the press as much as by themselves) as a fuck-you, a caustic riposte to a genre that had apparently taken every wrong turn possible in the 1990s. They likely give as much of a shit about how they ""fit in"" with rap in 2009 as they do about concepts like ""limited appeal."" Which is not to say the group doesn't have enough history behind them to be assessed on their own terms. They've gone from straight-up alienating to a somewhat reconciliatory place within the hip-hop nation. For an act usually classed with the late-90s mini-boom in indie-rap futurism, Anti-Pop's earliest 12""s sounded as if they were made with equipment as old as the printing press. A move to Warp for 2002's Arrythmia added a fresh coat of accessibility to Anti-Pop's antagonistic minimalism. Fluorescent Black-- their first non-collaborative album in seven years--Â sounds like Anti-Pop spent their time away coming to grips with the implied-but-never-fully-embraced pleasure principle of Arrythmia via side projects and solo albums. The foursome's name only occasionally suits the music here, unless you take branding into consideration. Fluorescent Black won't blow up at a time when Rick Ross deigning to sound interested on his own album is considered a major step forward among hip-hop critics, but here Anti-Pop take a less partisan approach to fun. And so since we're talking party music: ""NY to Tokyo""-- which soundsÂ stitched from 21st-century De La Soul and Men At Work's melody library--Â is chipper, about the last adjective I ever expected to use to describe an Anti-Pop record. And while Beans remains the Anti-Pop member you could best sell to rap fans who consider it music rather than some outlaw adjunct to poetry, even M. Sayyid and High Priest sound loosened up across the album, slowing down, using crowd-pleasing pacing, more willing to meet an audience raised on ""Crank Dat""-grade rhymes halfway. ""Goofy"": there's another word you'd be more likely to slap on Soulja Boy than Anti-Pop. Ditto ""playful."" And yet here's ""Born Electric"", with a hammy piano intro and ludicrously straight-faced crooning, managing to evoke Journey, Derrick May, and Vanessa Carlton within its first minute. I'm not even sure if Mike Ladd at his most Infections/Majesticons promiscuous would put Detroit pads and AOR cheese-pomp in the same track, let alone as its appetizer. Fluorescent Black's backing tracks, in all their mutant techno overbrightness and zig-zagging detail, re-expand the indie hip-hop palette. Not always to the good, mind you. Is ""The Solution"" a Kanye/T-Pain robo-voice tribute or parody? Or just a lukewarm trend jack? So sometimes they may be winking too hard to sell certain songs as anything other than well-made gags-- Anti-Pop's button-pushing still makes a nice break from all the posthumous J Dilla fellatio going around. All this lightening up is probably good for the soul, but what of the Anti-Pop refuseniks first fell in love with? Sometimes it crops up in unexpected ways. I appreciate anyone with the balls to scatter fans and foes alike with an album-opening blast of fugly hair metal. But my favorite track here might be the shortest and most ""traditionally Anti-Pop."" Lasting 1:30, its foul synth lurch like real-deal Rotterdam rottenness, Beans rips through ""Dragunov"" without pause, hook for cover, or cop to, well, pop. Music stripped to blunt-rhythm-and-nothing-but, the rap an excuse to leave fans breathless over skills they don't possess, ""Dragunov"" is hip-hop as old west line-in-sand at high noon, half-steppers left outside to wonder what the fuss is about. These go-hard-or-go-home tracks are still sprinkled across Fluorescent Black-- dizzying first single ""Capricorn One""; ""End Game"", a near-arrhythmic duel between gunshot-terse rhyme fragments and the beatbox it sounds like they're slowly killing; ""Timpani""'s (yes, them again) Neubauten tribalism and pervy Martin Denny jungle howls. But those who've been along for the 10-plus year ride may be looking for more of them. No one could stay as intractable as early Anti-Pop forever-- who would want to, except maybe straight-up horse-corpse-beating nihilists?-- but this sort of delight in scrapping is still what APC do best. The idea of an Anti-Pop greatest hits may be anathema-- at least philosophically-- but the moments when they push the genre's boundaries, rather than just fan expectations, are the parts of the group's catalog that will endure.","The caustic, adventurous hip-hop group returns for its firstÂ non-collaborative album in seven years.

Where the Wild Things Are OST,Karen O and the Kids,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a682ea9e61561daa53a9/1:1/w_160/0780909f.jpg,2009-10-08 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13550-where-the-wild-things-are-ost/,DGCInterscope,"Sure, you could look at Karen O's name on the soundtrack to the film adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are andÂ chalk it up to a convenient byproduct of her close relationship with the film's director, Spike Jonze. But really, there's no one better qualified for the job of translating Maurice Sendak's bedtime-story classic into song. Like Wild Things' young protagonist Max, Karen understands the power of imagination in transforming your mundane surroundings into something spectacular; witness the former Oberlin College student trying to make her way as a folksinger in Unitard, before refashioning herself into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' beer-spitting, mascara-smeared mouthpiece. Unlike most lead singers with a reputation for physically extreme performances, Karen O's onstage behavior is never really subjected to psychoanalytic interpretation, nor should it be: That giddy, childlike smile she routinely flashes lets us in on the make-believe fantasy of it all, reminding us once again that rock'n'roll is really just the grown-up version of building a fort or playing with dolls. So for Karen O, Where the Wild Things Are isn't just a soundtrack gig; it's a vessel through which she can again redraft her surroundings. This time, she plays the head mistress of a freak-folk dream-team (christened the Kids) that includes fellow Yeah Yeah Yeahs Nick Zinner, Brian Chase, and Imaad Wasif; Deerhunter's Bradford Cox; Aaron Hemphill of Liars; and Dean Fertita and Jack Lawrence of the Dead Weather. Strangely, the Wild Things trailer that's been burning up YouTube for the past month features not a note of music from this soundtrack album, instead luring us into the movie's magic animal kingdom through the choral grandeur of Arcade Fire's ""Wake Up"". But that track provides a cue for what Karen O and her Kids are aiming for here: a balance of the folky and fantastical, with immediate, all-together-now hooks designed for maximal campfire communalism. Children's music, in other words-- though, barring the forced simplicity of lead single ""All Is Love"" (presented in a simple sing-along and a more dramatic, Funeral-ready form), it's music that's direct and participatory enough to engage the kids without aggressively pandering to them; it won't be hard to get your young'un to shout along to the gleeful, wordless hollers on ""Rumpus"", but the forceful stomps on which they're delivered serves to remind us that, for all their cheek-pinching cuteness, kids can be nasty, destructive little buggers. While the song titles reference the movie's events and characters, the lyrics rarely do; strip away the requisite film-dialogue snippets, and this set could've been a bonus acoustic companion disc packaged with It's Blitz!. In a sense, this soundtrack serves a similar function for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs as the ""MTV Unplugged"" series did for grunge acts in the mid-90s-- an opportunity to strip down, but also get more elaborate and pile on the vibes, woodwinds, and other acoustic textures. However, while the spell-it-out chant ""Capsize"" and the dust-up jam ""Animal"" tap into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' feral energy, they ultimately feel like alternate, restrained versions of songs that would sound more effective and natural in amplified form. And, inevitably, there are a handful of incidental acoustic instrumentals that probably sound better when paired with Jonze's widescreen imagery. But the Wild Things soundtrack boasts enough illuminating, atypical turns from Karen O that make it worth experiencing independent of its source. The languorous lullaby ""Hideaway"" may be the least kid-friendly song here-- both in its strung-out, hazy-headed performance and my-baby's-gone subject matter-- but is a marvel nonetheless, a come-down sequel to ""Maps"" that the broken-hearted can comfort themselves with after the tears have dried. And it's no discredit to Karen's efforts to say that the soundtrack's most affecting moment is its lone cover-- for a film concerned with the complicated, conflicted relationship between childish whimsy and the real world, there's no better representative than Daniel Johnston, whose beautifully bruised ballad ""Worried Shoes"" is given a lovely, touching treatment by Karen. Like Johnston, Karen O has used music to access a fantasy world more exciting than the everyday one. The former's eccentricities put him in a mental hospital; the latter's got her on magazine covers. But the appearance of ""Worried Shoes"" on this soundtrack underscores the fact that, while our wildest fantasies are uniquely personal, the insecurities that inspire them are universal.","Karen O leads an all-star team (including members of YYYs, Liars, and Deerhunter) on the OST for Spike Jonze's film version of the Maurice Sendak classic.

Chicken Switch,Melvins,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67cb1335d7bf1698e37/1:1/w_160/af17345a.jpg,2009-10-07 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13545-chicken-switch/,Ipecac,"Lots of Melvins releases in the past decade could be called either conceptual or gimmicky, depending on your perspective. There were the collaborations on The Crybaby with everyone from David Yow to Leif Garrett; full-album partnerships with Jello Biafra, Lustmord, and FantÃ´mas; a staged ""live"" version of Houdini; and whatever the intermittently awesome Hostile Ambient Takeover was supposed to be. Interesting music at every stop, but overall an uneven track record, one that encourages doubts about any new Melvins diversion. Still, the idea behind Chicken Switch is promising. The band gave entire albums (and sometimes more) to noisy experimental artists, letting each melt, slice, and demolish the music into five-minute-or-so chunks. And the concept works, mostly because the band chose interesting remixers rather than famous ones. The only well-known names here are Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo, Matmos, and Boredoms' Eye Yamatsuka, and even Melvins fans may not recognize the other participants. But everyone involved attacks their work with vigor, precision, and an insatiable desire to test limits. And they all bring their A-games to Chicken Switch, making it less a Melvins remix record than a compilation of excellent experimental music. In other words, these aren't Melvins riffs set to dance beats. Occasionally the diehard fan might recognize the odd chord or familiar rhythm-- take Eye's loop of chugging riffs, or Ranaldo's busy multi-song edit, one of the few tracks with recognizable vocals. But more typical is the entry from Germany's Christoph Heemann. ""Emperor Twaddle (Remix)"" opens with three minutes of ringing drone-- stretching and thickening the intro of Honky's ""They All Must Be Slaughtered"" well past its original length-- followed by 30 seconds of riffs and beats blurred into cacophony. Most of Chicken Switch employs that kind of scorched-earth approach. Rather than rearranging the Melvins' basic atoms, the remixers split them apart, creating unpredictable bursts of noise and texture with completely new DNA. In that sense, ""remix"" is too narrow a term for what's going on here. Better to call these reincarnations, with the participants basically murdering the original music and pumping new breath and blood into its hollowed-out remains. This process produces impressive diversity. German artist RLW (who himself crafted a similar guest-remix project called Tulpas in the late 1990s) makes what sounds like a minimalist string quartet dragging their bows across metal objects. Viennese electronic group Farmers Manual compose a symphony of blips and growls, like a farther-out version of Black Dice. Japanese noise king Merzbow offers a soothing din chopped up by a clanging beat. And former Melvin David Scott Stone stretches King Buzzo's vocals into a wordless choir of gurgling drones. The highlight of Chicken Switch comes from Kawabata Makoto of Acid Mothers Temple. ""4th Floor Hellcopter"" opens with a slow, crunchy beat, slides into forbidding feedback, then ascends into burning metal guitar and stereo-spanning dissonance. Kawabata bridges the gap between recognizable riffs and all-out abstraction, pointing out the rich diversity inside the Melvins' music. As a whole, Chicken Switch does the same. Its wide sonic range is testament to how much lurks beneath the surface of every Melvins album. Whatever faults one can find in their experiments, their work is clearly deep enough to be worthy of such off-center explorations.","Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo, Matmos, and Boredoms' Eye Yamatsuka are among participants in a remix LP that's more like aÂ comp of excellent experimental music.

Goodnight Unknown,Lou Barlow,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a685c0084474cd0c09b0/1:1/w_160/9cdbcfbb.jpg,2009-10-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13556-goodnight-unknown/,Merge,"Lou Barlow doesn't need a solo career, really. No matter how you slice the indie rock discography, Barlow is central to anywhere from at least three to as many as 10 canonical releases. Between Dinosaur Jr.'s first three LPs, through the uneven highs of both Sebadoh and Sentridoh and on to D Jr.'s magnetic reunion albums (some might count Folk Implosion... might), Barlow's legacy stands as much more than a footnote. In fact, even calling the output of Barlow-- now 43 and a married, soon-to-be father of two-- a legacy is to date him prematurely. Back in the musically unblemished if personally infamous Dinosaur Jr. trio, he's playing to the biggest crowds and most fanfare of his career. And we're not talking the sort of big gigs where Candlebox or the Spin Doctors shuffle through the hits in your town square (or is that just my town square?) for a few thousand lushes on a summer day, either. Dinosaur Jr. is arguably releasing the best music of its career (and its members' respective careers) right now. Their new records and their distinct history have made them, these days, a very big deal. Not bad for a quarter century, huh? But Goodnight Unknown, Barlow's second solo LP for Merge Records, offers 14 tracks and 37 minutes of proof that Barlow is neither content with the comforts of his rock band's renewed popularity or with the scattered, shambolic solo discography he's built over two decades as Sentridoh. Though it boasted not only what might be the best song ever about a stray cat (""The Ballad of Daykitty"") but also one of rock's quietest moments of devilish heresy (""Mary""), Emoh, Barlow's first album under his own name, often felt too domestic, easy, and assured, as if Barlow got halfway into a track and-- true to his lo-fi heritage-- simply exclaimed, ""Fuck it."" That makes sense, of course, for an album whose title is ""Home"" in reverse and which was recorded half alone. Goodnight Unknown feels comfortable and, to a point, casual, too, but it bears the kind of exploratory vigor that Emoh lacked. Stylistically, it's much more diverse than Emoh, squeezing many of Barlow's alternate modes-- Dinosaur Jr.'s pop crunch, Sebadoh's wiry nerves, Sentridoh's acoustic mold-- into a well-paced and well-produced whole. The songs are mostly simple, but the production of Andrew Murdock and the assistance of a cast that includes Lisa Germano, ex-Soul Coughing bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and Dinosaur Jr.'s Murph add enough flourishes to make careful listens rewarding. Opener ""Sharing"", for instance, is a turgid power-pop charger, pushed from behind by Melvin Dale Crover-- a friend of Barlow's because they cruise the same Los Angeles ""pre-school circuit,"" says Barlow-- and guided by a chorus that opens wide like the top of a convertible. But ""The Right"" is a lithe pop march. Like bedroom Spoon, its understated structure centers on an unshifting, up-down beat and simple chords from an acoustic guitar, all decorated by a chiseled electric line and keys that twinkle between the layers. During ""One Machine, One Long Fight"", the thick drums, circular bass, and anxious vocals saturate the tape. The thuds swell in the speakers as with any number of post-Neutral Milk Hotel acts. ""The One I Call"", though, is a gentle acoustic lilt that punctuates the beautifully intertwined guitars of Barlow and Imaad Wasif with drums so simple they sound like a five-gallon bucket banged with a rubber mallet. And lyrically, Goodnight Unknown moves well beyond the reductive (and, for a while now, very wrong) image of Barlow as a moping misanthrope. That picture, of course, was rightfully established by records like Sebadoh's Bakesale (""Somehow I don't trust you/ I don't trust myself"") and songs like Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Don't"" (""Why don't you like me?"" ad infinitum). Goodnight Unknown, however, is a reassuring mix of resignation and resistance wherein Barlow admits he's not all powerful but that he's not going to let the world trample him, either. Curious rhetorical devices line these proclamations. Like on the bittersweet ""I'm Thinking..."", Barlow steadies himself amid anxieties about the future by using existential tautologies as crutches. ""The older I get, I get older,"" he sings, somewhere between a whisper and a croon. ""Some days are short, others longer."" He pines about his new quest for patience and laments his own nasty habits. Ultimately, he defends his ""right to be conflicted."" And on the gorgeous ""Take Advantage"", he diagrams love like an exotic chemical equation: ""Take apart a rainbow/ Feed it to the sunrise/ Wake me with your elbow/ And I'll know."" Silly and charming, it feels less like an attempt to be clever than an attempt to be honest, or to document exactly how he feels. And, in the end, isn't that the point? Goodnight Unknown isn't a record that looks to cement some sort of amorphous legacy. It's Barlow's attempt to, you know, be a songwriter. Given that legacy, though, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Lou Barlow excels at being as much.","On his second solo album under his own name, the indie rock veteran does a little of everything he does well and improves on his last outing, Emoh.

Bonfires on the Heath,The Clientele,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6795e6ef95969320d4d/1:1/w_160/3f1a0701.jpg,2009-10-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13544-bonfires-on-the-heath/,Merge,"Who could have guessed, as the first decade of the new millennium came on like a clean slate, that the Clientele would have a multi-album career in them? A follow-up to the band's 2000 singles collection, Suburban Light-- so ingratiating and familiar it felt like the distillation of some heartsick indie-pop ideal-- seemed less impossible than superfluous. When something feels perfect, you don't necessarily want want xeroxes, however much you may think you want more in your life. Yet here we are, as the first decade of the new millennium slumps to an ignoble close, with the fourth Clientele album. (Fifth, if you count Suburban Light.) And thankfully the band never really did attempt to reconjure the magic of those early singles, perhaps realizing that leaning on the same reverb-blurry signature would have dimmed the original's charm. What made the Clientele special proved surprisingly durable across multiple releases, fidelity upgrades, and songwriting shifts. That special something at first felt impossible to convey. Atmosphere. ""Vibe."" Put on a Clientele record and you're entering a space, one crafted as much through sound as lyrical associations, which tend toward the kind of quasi-cinematic string-pulling that makes for the band's own brand of enjoyable clichÃ©. It's lonely without tipping into alienation. It's in tune with the power of memory without being deadened by generic nostalgia. It's someplace where changes in the weather can leave people dumbstruck. And if the music itself were a hair more melodramatic, its wistfulness would probably be unbearable. But the band's restraint, skirting emotional didacticism while still providing room for listeners' own specific states, appeals to humanity's more evanescent (and maybe pop-resistant) feelings. If you're never going to hear unfettered joy on a Clientele record, they're never woe-is-me slogs, either. That said, despite the band's admirable disinterest in repeating themselves, Bonfires stumbles when the Clientele ditch the musical framework they've perfected to carry these less-than-obvious emotional states. For new listeners, think heartsick, echo-wobbly strum carried along (just barely) by the shuffle of 1960s AM gold. The Clientele are not, despite the guitars and their era-specific sound, a rock'n'roll band. You can't imagine them whipping a club full of Hamburg drunks into a chair-flinging frenzy. That sort of energy sounds feigned and forced coming from a band known for music fragile enough to be shattered by a forceful cough from the audience. Bonfires tracks like ""I Wonder Who We Are"" and ""Sketch"" are stiff approximations of cutting loose. If not quite as cheesy as interstitial music in a Mike Myers vehicle, they're still pretty ersatz. Still, we're talking a handful of uptempo misfires out of 12 tracks. The Clientele aren't vain or foolish enough to try rocking out for a whole album. And even the ersatz shit sounds lush as hell. If the early Clientele singles made a virtue of trad indie pop's innovation-through-cheapness recording values, those values actually added to the music's character-- reverb can cover a lot of empty space on both the songwriting and production end of things-- then maturity as a band (and slightly bigger budgets, presumably) made that Clientele-specific sense of place all the more 3-D. The sound of Suburban Light was as smudgy as a head under the effects of cheap wine. Bonfires retains just enough of a fuzzy edge-- a Clientele album without fuzz would be the work of another band entirely-- while its clearer bursts of guitars, bells, organs, piano, strings, and horns lend a gentle eeriness, like bright radio melodies heard through the bleary ears of pre-coffee early morning. Crucially, in terms of this tension between clarity and fuzziness, fire and varying intensities of late-summer light seem to have replaced rain and early spring's lingering dimness as the band's go-to tropes this time out. Bonfires is an indian summer record if ever there was one, music for the dizzying strangeness of unseasonable warmth as the trees begin to brown and sweaters come out of storage. The title track conjures images of watching kids through sleep-deprived eyes as they crowd around piles of burning refuse, the guitars peeling and quavering like weak flames. Frontman Alasdair MacLean even drops the line, ""late October sunlight in the woods,"" if you needed a no-nonsense scene-setter. The next track's called ""Harvest Time"", a similar late-decade thickening of the band's patented murmuring drift, paring the lyrics down even further to leave just wordless long notes that hover between grown-ass swoon and little boy longing. But that title, though: Throughout Bonfires, it's as if the band's trying to beat the synesthetes at their own game, making an album impossible to describe without using colors like ochre and umber and sunset red. You may not be able to recall its melody without prompting, but damned if you wouldn't be able to describe the image it paints with lyrics you could inscribe on a matchbook. The best of the Bonfires extends the Clientele's great project: building, through hyper-evocative descriptive fragments and music to match, one of the great imaginary places in pop. The Clientele's suburb is obviously the product of an English coming of age, but it's also just dreamily vague enough to mirror the lives of listeners almost anywhere. (Unless you happen to live in one of those William Gibsonish fourth-world megalopolises with no green spaces.) The vibe of Bonfires is strong enough to almost feel the leaves crunching underfoot and smell the smoke cutting through the growing chill in the air, an indie-pop equivalent to Brian Eno's windswept and stone-solid world-building circa On Land. It's not an album you can dance to, but it's one you can live in and with, alone, which is rare enough to be applauded. The band's steadily curated one of the decade's great bodies of mood music. In an odd way, it strikes me as almost cousin to Sufjan Stevens' quixotic attempt to bring each state in the union to life: The Clientele seem to be trying to capture the light and air and meteorological conditions and attendant emotional baggage of each season, with a disarmingly straight-faced grace and wonder that makes it one of pop's more laudable long-term career moves.","Capping off one of the decade's great bodies of mood music, the Clientele continue to conjure and charm through their evocative music.

Ghostdini: The Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City,Ghostface Killah,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a671c0084474cd0c097c/1:1/w_160/91855a7a.jpg,2009-10-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13537-ghostdini-the-wizard-of-poetry-in-emerald-city/,Def Jam,"On the face of it, a Ghostface R&B album isn't the worst idea in the world. Ghost, after all, has traveled this ground before. On his debut album Ironman, he enlisted Mary J. Blige for ""All That I Got Is You"", a gut-wrenching memoir of a childhood spent picking roaches out the cereal box. And on The Pretty Toney Album nugget ""Holla"", he straight-up rapped over an entire sweaty Delfonics oldie, his urgent yowl thrillingly banging against the song's weeping strings and punchdrunk guitars. Ghost understands how soul music works, and many of his own best records strive for transcendence as hard as any old Al Green jam. If he'd used either of those tracks as the basis for The Wizard of Poetry, we could have a classic on our hands. But you review the album you got, not the album you wanted. Rather than either of those tracks, Ghost has built his R&B experiment, understandably enough, around the only song of his to get significant New York radio burn in recent years: The Ne-Yo collaboration ""Back Like That"", the sole Hot 97 concession on the otherwise hard-as-fuck Fishscale. (The Kanye-assisted remix shows up here as a bonus track even though it was already on More Fish three years ago.) ""Back Like That"" wasn't a bad song-- far from it-- but it's tough to imagine how Ghost thought he could make an album full of that, especially when he didn't land a single guest singer anywhere near as talented as Ne-Yo. In fact, it's tough to imagine how The Wizard of Poetry came into existence in the first place. If it's a A&R-driven commercial Hail Mary, then how did the Def Jam authorities allow Ghost to get away with ""Stapleton Sex"", the squirmiest fuck jam in recent memory? ""Stapleton Sex"", which Ghost hilariously alleges he wrote for Natalie Portman, starts out with ""My face is wet, got a hair on my tongue,"" and only gets more greasily specific from there. (""This ain't no R&B dick,"" he helpfully points out.) But if the whole album is Ghost's baby, then why is he paired up with scrub-ass R&B new jacks like Lloyd and Ron Brownz? I promise you, Ghost doesn't bang any Lloyd CDs in his car. As a writer, though, Ghost remains fascinating and contradictory. Check, for instance, opening track ""Not Your Average Girl"", where he builds his perfect woman (she should be on the couch reading a book and biting a pen when she gets home, but also shoot home invaders, which seems like a tall order) before tossing all that to the side on the last verse: ""We run trains on them bitches, never ice they arms."" Or ""Do Over"", where he starts out hangdog, apologizing for every form of infidelity before revealing that he's on a bus to prison, apologizing for that, too, and signing off with this: ""Thanks for your patience. You find a man. I hope he's true."" Even the halfassed songs are filled with enormously likable turns of phrase, like when Ghost interrupts a story mid-sentence to refer to himself as a ""prestigious gentleman."" So many great little verbal moments here: ""The smell of her fragrance baffled my nostrils,"" ""My dick is hard as a callus,"" ""I pull out like a tooth in the back, it's rotten."" A totally sincere pickup line: ""I would love to have a thing like you on the team."" Another: ""I love it like that, stretchmark fat."" And Ghost delivers all this stuff straight-faced; he doesn't do punchlines. Even when he's trying to be as straightforward as possible, his mind works in fascinating ways. You just have to wade through swamps of dreck to find those brilliant little moments. The Wizard of Poetry has exactly one indispensable moment: the weirdly gripping story-song ""Guest House"", where Ghost bugs out looking for his girlfriend before finding her banging the cable guy, played by a titanically goofy Fabolous. Ghost's response: ""Snatched his covers/ Had them looking like the black Adam and Eve, two sinful lovers."" ""Guest House"" comes packed with the same plot twists and telling details and a breathless crime narrative like ""Shakey Dog"", but it uses them in the service of, basically, a soap opera, or a ""Trapped in the Closet"" chapter. It works in a way that almost nothing else here completely manages.","Whether as a commercial concession or an experimental detour, Ghost goes full-tilt R&B on his new album.

Run Rabbit Run,Osso,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67f5e6ef95969320d58/1:1/w_160/10d97c1c.jpg,2009-10-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13548-run-rabbit-run/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Run Rabbit Run is an uncategorizable oddity: a collection of inventively arranged chamber pieces for string quartet that just happen to be written by Sufjan Stevens. The source material comes from Stevens' second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a set of glitchy, playful electronic miniatures based on the Chinese zodiac cycle that bore zero resemblance to the orchestral folk-pop for which he would become famous. Taking a page from Bang on a Can All-Stars' reworking of Brian Eno's Music for Airports and contemporary classical ensemble Alarm Will Sound's transcriptions of Aphex Twin, the string quartet Osso has hired a phalanx of New York's hippest young composers to recast these works as a surprisingly full-bodied and thoughtful series of picaresques. The results show gratifyingly little of the shallowness and amateurism that sometimes infects ventures beginning in rock and crossing over into the classical realm. The New York composers Osso has enlisted-- Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane, Michael Atkinson, Olivier Manchon, Rob Moose, and Maxim Moston-- display real ingenuity in transcribing and setting these pieces for traditional string quartet. Osso's transcribers have risen gamely to the challenge of rendering glitchy electronic music for stringed instruments, seeming to treat it almost like a dare-- or an opportunity to remind the world that you don't need computers or amplification to make all those funny noises. In this spirit, they incorporate as many odd instrumental textures they can come up with, scratching and plunking away with abandon, and cycling neatly through a catalog's worth of 20th-century chamber music influences in the process. The lurching, grotesque dance rhythms on ""Year of the Ox"" summon BartÃ³k's darker interpretations of Hungarian folk tunes: On ""Year of the Sheep"", an uneasy wash of unresolved chords that recalls Charles Ives' ""Three Places in New England"" settles like mist while someone makes clicking noises with their mouth. Echoes of Debussy's String Quartet No. 1 pop up everywhere. The title track sounds like Ravel's String Quartet in F as played by slightly overzealous high schoolers. Not that you have to know anything about classical music to enjoy Run Rabbit Run. The Easter Egg hunt is a fun and absorbing game for classical nerds, but the album works just fine without it. Osso play with a rich, gorgeous tone and a wonderfully alert dynamic, switching effortlessly between beautiful string passages and gnarlier sound effects. ""Year of the Snake"" opens with an expansive, long-limbed string melody (echoes of Copland), but less than a minute in, a cellist digs lustily into his C string until it groans and scrunches in protest, the pitch warping like a sun-damaged cassette. From there, we get a round-robin of creepy harmonics, a triumphant theme that feels appropriate for a royal court, and some scurrying string scratches redolent of things living in your floorboards. It's a pleasantly dizzying tour and it all takes place in five minutes. It's hard to know what Sufjan fanatics, who have been waiting four years now for a proper full-length follow-up to Illinois, will make of this one-off, but Run Rabbit Run serves as a welcome reminder that his curious, try-anything spirit is part of what got our attention in the first place. It also functions nicely as a palette cleanser to help prepare for the deluge of Sufjan-related activities looming on the horizon: the multimedia box-set release of his BQE suite and an ambient instrumental album recorded with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, and Bryce Dessner of the National. The excellence of Run Rabbit Run reassures that whatever seemingly dubious, over-ambitious, or unlikely project Sufjan tackles next, it will probably prove worthy of our attention.","Sufjan Stevens' experimental electronic LPÂ Enjoy Your Rabbit is recast as a modern classic work byÂ Osso and many of NYC's hippest young composers.

Family,Le Loup,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6839d034d5c69bf355b/1:1/w_160/fc32d493.gif,2009-10-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13551-family/,Hardly Art,"""Le Loup"" means ""the wolf"" in French. Sam Simkoff, frontman of the D.C.-based indie pop quintet that bears the appellation, claims he chose it to riff on all the other indie groups out there with the word ""Wolf"" in their names, self-consciously ratcheting up the pretentiousness meter by translating it into another tongue. It's a great joke that shows Simkoff has a keen eye for hipster trends, and his band's music is likewise plugged in to the zeitgeist. In interviews, when asked to tick off influences, Simkoff and his bandmates don't reach for ultra-obscure 1960s cult artists or hyper-ironic mainstream touchstones, but freely list folks like Animal Collective, Sufjan Stevens, and Grizzly Bear. In contrast, for instance, to the glo-fi thing that has seemed to burble up fairly organically this year from various and sundry quarters, Le Loup's music feels like a direct reaction to what indie-rock's A-List has been cooking up over the past couple of years. You could certainly argue that Animal Collective belongs at the top of this heap as the reigning kings of indie, so perhaps it should be no surprise that AC is far and away Le Loup's biggest source of sonic inspiration on the band's sophomore LP, Family (again demonstrating an impressive feel for subtle shifts in subcultural taste, the group's 2007 debut was far more Sufjan-beholden). All of the most distinguishing AC traits are on display here, as layers upon layers of reverbed harmonies get distorted and smeared atop equally diffuse artilleries of percussion. It's an impossible comparison to shake, especially during a couple of really on-the-nose moments like the cymbal crashes of ""Forgive Me"" or the watery effects of ""Sherpa"". If you wanted to be somewhat cynical you could think of this album as a sort of palatable gateway drug for listeners who've yet to stomach Animal Collective's lengthier, noisier, more out-there head trips. Le Loup trade chaos and dissonance for reassurance and tranquility thanks in large part to an abundance of folkier accoutrements like banjo and mandolin, deployed throughout the album and utilized to particularly pleasing effect on the ruminative ""Go East"" and on ""Morning Song"", which hints at a recognition of Fleet Foxes' recent prominence. Even if the overall effect here isn't terribly original, there are still plenty of nice touches spread throughout these tracks to suggest Le Loup holds the potential to become more than an amalgam of well-regarded influences. ""Beach Town"" rides a full-toned bass and lovely ascending guitar figure, while ""Grow"" allows ""Be My Baby"" drums and a general early-60s lilt to pierce through the ghostly murk. Best of all is the closing ""A Celebration"", which works up a genuine groove and then tantalizingly kisses it with some beautiful guitar glints that alternately evoke Afro-pop and the Allman Brothers. More of this please.","Hardly Art band's sophomore album bears the fingerprints of many of today's top indie bands, including Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear.

Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 1965-1968,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66bea9e61561daa5374/1:1/w_160/ff6bad4a.jpg,2009-10-06 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13532-where-the-action-is-los-angeles-nuggets-1965-1968/,Rhino,"At some point in the mid 1960s, the kids started hanging around on Sunset Strip, which at the time was still home to many of the restaurants that once boasted famous Hollywood patrons. To curtail the invading counterculture, the city imposed a strict curfew, and cops clashed with longhairs in a series of small riots that galvanized the hippies rather than dispersed them. The skirmishes inspired Buffalo Springfield to write ""For What It's Worth"" and Four-Leaf Productions to bankroll the teensploitation flick Riot on Sunset Strip, featuring a theme song by local group the Standells. It begins mundanely enough: ""I'm going down to the Strip tonight, I'm not on a stay-home trip tonight,"" sings drummer Dick Dodd over Tony Valentino's snarling guitar lick. But the song's hard beat is more of a billy-club swing than a hip shake, and the lyrics become increasingly serious, as he laments the Strip has become ""just a place for black-and-white cars to race. It's causin' a riot!"" More pointed and angry than the square film that bears it title, the song depicts Los Angeles as a tensed city on the brink of chaos and violence, and the Standells could just as well have been singing about Watts or any of the race riots that made the curfew clashes seem polite and placid by comparison. ""Riot on Sunset Strip"" kicks off Rhino's 4xCD set Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 1965-1968, setting the scene for the 100 tracks that follow. Local bands were drawing inspiration from the sights all around them, whether it was sirens on a cop car or sirens dancing in the clubs. For them, L.A. was the center of the universe, if not the entire universe itself, and these groups-- some of whom, in true Nuggets fashion, lasted no more than a 45 or two-- established a particular dialogue with the city that projected well beyond Sunset Strip and reverberated around the Valley. Arthur Lee details just such a trippy travelogue on ""You I'll Be Following"", a bouncy number from Love's debut with killer harmonies and his electric vocal. Kim Fowley's hysteric ""Underground Lady"" tries to capture the scene in the surreal slang of the times, and on ""Los Angeles"", one-time Byrd Gene Clark calls it the ""city of the doomed,"" although you might swear he's singing ""city of the dunes."" Despite its appearance of insularity, the scene was not a closed circuit. In 1965, the Byrds charted a hit with a cover of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", and their then-new folk-rock not only energized local musicians, inspiring scores of imitators and innovators, but attracted the attention of listeners, DJs, and suits across the country. Where the Action Is! picks up around this time, introducing the Byrds with ""You Movin'"", a sophisticated throwaway from their early ""preflyte"" sessions. You can hear their influence throughout the box set, as other musicians put their stamp on the sound, mixing it with go-go rhythms, psychedelic mindmelts, art-rock excursions, canyon folk, and pretty much anything else that came to hand. Including bagpipes. A diverse collection of tunes that have little else in common beyond geography, Where the Action Is! depicts the L.A. scene as impossibly busy and variegated. The first two discs collect songs from some of the progenitors of the sound, who played frequently in the clubs and taverns that eventually took over the Strip. The desert eccentricities of Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band's ""Zig Zag Wanderer"" jostle with the proto-flower-power sounds of the Seeds' ""Tripmaker"" and the southwestern flair of the Bobby Fuller Four's ""Baby, My Heart"". The Rising Sons' ""Take a Giant Step"" sounds self-propelled and gritty, at distinct odds with the Palace Guard's ""All Night Long"" and Sonny & Cher's ""It's Gonna Rain"", which sound stuffy by comparison. The Strip found room for all these disparate acts, who honed their distinctive sounds through live performance before demanding audiences. As the second disc moves beyond those clubs to document the bands around the Valley and throughout the Inland Empire, Where the Action Is! grows even heavier, more adventurous, and more diverse: There's a considerable Latino presence here, such as Thee Midniters rumbling through their energetic ""Jump, Jive & Harmonize"" and the Premiers begging you to ""Get on This Plane"". Acts like the Chymes and Penny Arkade offer very different takes on the Strip beat, suggesting the vast difference between the artists there and elsewhere. If the first half of the set emphasizes performance, the third and fourth discs examine the evolution of the studio as an instrument, whether as an agent for Thorinshield's psychedelic exploration on ""Daydreaming"" or as a tool for beefing up rock songs like Keith Allison's ""Action, Action, Action"". There's an even wider range of sounds, obviously, although the songs typically lack the hard-edged grooves of the Strip bands: Jan and Dean's ""Fan Tan"" and the Yellow Balloon's ""Yellow Balloon"" even sound like commercial jingles, and Rick Nelson's kitschy ""Marshmallow Skies"" comes across as a targeted cred grab, despite his avowed advocacy of the new folk rock. But there's an even larger narrative traced by these discs, which show how the sounds that developed in clubs and bars were adopted by more ambitious and at times already established artists. There are familiar, sometimes unexpected names on the fourth disc: Tim Buckley and Randy Newman were both influenced by this scene, and their songs show little-heard aspects of their work. Peter Fonda and Hugh Masekela collaborated to record Gram Parsons' ""November Night"" (which Parsons himself never recorded), and Where the Action Is! persuasively argues for the Strip's impact on the Beach Boys by including an alternate take of ""Heroes and Villains"", whose menacing sound bite-- ""You're under arrest!""-- sounds especially loaded in this context. Together, these four discs give the sense of an exciting rock underground arising and mutating and interacting with and changing the mainstream-- not just locally but nationally and internationally. It'd be 10 years before L.A.'s scene would regain this level of excitement and punk purpose, but that's another box set altogether.","Rhino continues its expansion of the Nuggets brand with a 4xCD look at the fertile Sunset Strip and other SoCal musical locales of 1965-68.

Step aside Girls, we've got a new backstory winner for 2009. It's a credit to the record then that none of these angles turn out to be easy nooses by which to hang the project. The one triggering most alarm bells, of course, is Gosling's involvement, since everyone knows that movie-star bands tend to range from amateurishly terrible to inoffensively generic. Well, I'll dispel that preconception straight away-- Dead Man's Bones is a really, really weird record, a project where the musical reference points at least indicate that Gosling and his co-conspirator Zach Shields have record collections that go deeper than an iPod nano. The other two angles-- spooky themes and a kid's choir-- are both symptoms of the record's most endearing quality, a surplus of ideas and a willingness to combine them in ways that are vibrant, sloppy, and fun. Though the record begins with a pretentious spoken-word introductory track (kind of a necessary concept-album evil) followed by its worst song (the Ambien-overdosed and over-serious ""Dead Hearts""), the remainder of the project is slapdash, giddy, and surprisingly dense. Like an old Elephant 6 record, Dead Man's Bones has a lo-fi warts-and-all feel that's less lazy aesthetic than charmingly handmade, even more charismatic for it's unevenness. That enthusiasm manifests itself best in places like the hand-clap percussion that propels ""Lose Your Soul"" and ""In the Room Where You Sleep"", both of which feature Gosling's surprisingly effective croon. Songs follow unusual paths-- ""In the Room"" goes from ""Monster Mash"" organ-rock to a soft Rhodes coda; ""My Body's a Zombie For You"" has a flute solo breakdown and an a cappella chant; several songs repurpose laughter and chatter from the kids of the choir as ambient noise. And while most of the supernatural themes are more grade-school Halloween party than horror movie, there are a handful of genuinely unsettling moments-- the aquatic ghost story of ""Buried in Water"" slashed through with sad, shrill children's voices that remind of Bob Drake's brilliantly scary The Skull Mailbox; a creepy whispered monologue in the middle of ""Young & Tragic"" that sounds like a kid conversing with an imaginary friend. I recognize that the children's choir might be a dealbreaker for some, but the tenaciousness with which Dead Man's Bones use the choir should win over all but the most ardent kid-haters. Sure, there's a bit of the time-honored Roger Waters tradition of making kids sing slightly inappropriate lyrics-- the first line they're given to sing is the eerie ""Like a lamb to the slaughter"" and their participation on a song called ""My Body's a Zombie For You"" is ever so slightly disconcerting. But the kids also add swooping, dramatic ""woah-ohhhs"" that would make the Arcade Fire jealous, and get some meatier parts in the harmonized syncopations of ""Lose Your Soul"" or the showtuney curtain-dropping chorus of ""Flowers Grow Out of My Grave"". Overall, I'm as surprised as you are with Dead Man's Bones. So many ways for it to go wrong, but instead it's a unique, catchy and lovably weird record, with highlights (the electric piano singalong ""Pa Pa Power"", the Beck-ish ""Werewolf Heart"") that could hold their own with the best indie singles of the year. Perhaps all those easy angles are a smokescreen, a diversion to lower expectations on a record strong enough to be listened to both without preconceptions and long after its Halloween expiration date.","Oscar-nominated actor Ryan Gosling gets a friend and a children's choir together for a truly unusual and surprising record.

In and Out of Control,The Raveonettes,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a668c0084474cd0c0963/1:1/w_160/a0905a34.jpg,2009-10-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13529-in-and-out-of-control/,Vice,"""We didn't sell millions of albums, and we didn't become an arena-packing band. I could have predicted that,"" Sune Rose Wagner wrote in anticipation of In and Out of Control, his fourth proper album with co-Raveonette Sharin Foo. Yeah, we could have predicted that, too. In fact, we expected a lot less from the Raveonettes: After two great records (the debut EP Whip It On, followed by the markedly better full-length Chain Gang of Love), it became fairly clear that these Danes were destined to remain faithful to a singular trick (the overblown Jesus and Mary Chain/ Phil Spector fanaticism; eyeliner), always well-rehearsed and respectfully researched. But by the time their make-or-break mainstream offering Pretty in Black showed up, most interest in their reverb-addled, shooby-doo-wop indulgences had waned. It made waiting a few years for Crystal Stilts pretty easy. But with their return-to-loud third album Lust Lust Lust, we found a band embracing their failure to launch, reconnecting with (and latching more tightly to) a sound they so lovingly cultured. So you could almost call In and Out of Control a sophomore effort of sorts: ""Now I tremble in New York City, the times we had were the best, yeah baby,"" sings Wagner on ""Gone Forever"", a fantastically dispiriting, too-old-for-this-shit sequel to Chain Gang's ""New York Was Great"". Less gorgeously noisy than Lust, Control makes up for all that grand recklessnessÂ in its sure-footing and execution. A glance at the track listing might persuade one to think that this affair will prove assuredly more ""out of control"" than ""in"" (""Suicide"", ""D.R.U.G.S."", ""Breaking Into Cars""), but most of these songs invert the anticipated and adopt a playfulness that's both disquietingly funny and humbly self-referential. Single ""Last Dance""-- a resplendent dose of dreambeat prom-pop-- perfectly exemplifies the morbid tongue-in-cheek formula that the best tracks on Control subscribe to. Here, we find a character asking an eventual overdose victim to save the titular last dance for them, though it's apparent the inevitable death of the dancer is far less important than the fulfillment of the traditional ""Spring Fling"" date contract (or more pointedly, simply an ode to teenage narcissism). Whether laying a lover to rest on the interlude ""Oh, I Buried You Today"" (""It's so hard for me to say sweet words about you,"" Foo muses adorably) or frankly embracing their outward influences on ""Suicide"" (assuming that this runaway tale's motto of ""lick your lips and fuck suicide"" is less about deciding not to off yourself and more about literally giving yourself to no wave), Control's unsettling sense of humor helps categorize the Raveonettes as a weather-tested act that has the good sense to play with the motifs and textures they used to take all too seriously. This of course brings us to the big water-cooler centerpiece ""Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed)"", an unnervingly direct and plainly stated song about the frighteningly real effects of sexual assault, made all the more shiver-worthy in its saccharine-laced delivery. ""Those fuckers stay in your head,"" Foo chimes, uncomfortably pitched like an innocent line from a long-lost Ronettes tune about being stood-up. It's a debilitatingly chilling, calculatingly emasculating idea that shouldn't work but does, and only provides further insight into how clever and accomplished the Raveonettes can sound when they feel this confident in their own skin. When things do begin to feel a little too familiar (the dead-eyed twist of ""Heart of Stone"" and the peppery opener ""Bang!"" feel dredged from sessions that could very well date back to the very beginning of the band's existence), Control manages to pull clever punches that keep interests piqued. The dramatic disco-pulse of highlight ""D.R.U.G.S."" or the barefaced sex metaphors that build ""Breaking Into Cars"" are artful in their ability to circumvent convention just enough to please familiar listeners and still satisfy the songwriters' needier impulses. ""[Control is about]Â not giving a shit what other people think of you and most importantly being mad and angelic,"" Wagner stated in that same press release. He's dead-on; for that we can certainly be appreciative.","Sticking with the sure-footed, loud formula that suited them on their debut and Lust Lust Lust, these Danish JAMC acolytes are back on a roll.

Warm Heart of Africa,The Very Best,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65db1335d7bf1698df2/1:1/w_160/c7c0f8b1.jpg,2009-10-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13518-warm-heart-of-africa/,Green Owl,"There was a David and Goliath quality to the simultaneous performances that closed out the 2009 Pitchfork Music Festival. Against the Flaming Lips' grid-draining light show and extravagant confetti budget, the Very Best pitted a grinning guy in a rakishly cocked plaid hat, a stocky Euro-hipster with a console-laden table, and a couple of head-wrapped backup singers. The crowd seemed thin and politely engaged during the first song. By the last, the audience had swelled considerably, and everyone was bouncing up and down-- a sea of genuinely happy faces. That's the simplest and most important thing about the Very Best. Their enthusiasm is contagious. The group debuted last year with the superlative mixtape Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit Are the Very Best. The Malawi-born singer ran a secondhand shop in London, where he met Etienne Tron of Radioclit (Tron is French; his partner Johan Karlberg is Swedish). Radioclit's prior work had leaned heavily on grime, Miami bass, crunk, and other aggressive genres; they dubbed their style ""ghetto-pop."" But with the Very Best mixtape, they turned from dark, druggy hedonism to effervescent productions that blended Afropop-laced originals with mixes of M.I.A. and Vampire Weekend. It was feel-good music that felt fresh and healthful, just like Mwamwaya's voice. He sang ebulliently in Chichewa, English, and other languages, and the foreignness of the words only cleared the way for the life-affirming feeling that shined through them. Warm Heart of Africa, the group's official debut, rises to the high standard set by the mixtape, from which only two tracks are held over: ""Kamphopo"", where Mwamwaya swaggers through sun-streaked Architecture in Helsinki samples, and a dance mix of ""Kada Manja"", with added drums and some of its strings gathered up into a loping rhythm. A couple of guest stars also return. Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend duets with Mwamwaya on the title track, which will probably be the first song on the album that knocks out most listeners. ""The boys move fast/ You should take it slow,"" they advise coquettishly, in an irresistible hopscotch cadence, over splashes of sampled guitar and hand percussion. And M.I.A. appears on ""Rain Dance"", panting and purring over a taut drumline, in one of the album's few respites from blaring melody. This sense of continuity with the mixtape is bolstered by the fact that some of these songs are so immediate you'll swear you've heard them before, like ""Julia"", which sounds like some kind of sublimely cheerful G-funk. Radioclit deserve a lot of credit for keeping the vibe upbeat but diverse: Whether they're cooking up a snap track with pizzicato accents on ""Yalira"", pinging 1980s synth-pop on ""Chalo"", tropical dreams on ""Angonde"", or kwaito-inspired pulses on ""Ntdende Uli"", they stay out of Mwamwaya's way, using small and tactile rhythmic embellishments to give him extra kick-- always lively, never cluttered. Which is smart, because Mwamwaya is a scene-stealer, for the uncomplicated reason that he sings like an angel and takes evident pleasure in doing so. On ""Zam'dziko"", his voice weaves in and out of itself, adorned only with sporadic drum claps. For Mwamwaya, a hot beat is always nice, but pretty much optional. The album's biggest asset has to do with his presence, and it's hard to put a name to-- ""spiritual generosity"" sounds too grand, but that's what it feels like. Some people tend to get up in arms whenever African music gets mixed up with Western genres-- as if they haven't always been in a dialogue, like how marabi is related to American jazz. The Very Best inspired me to learn more about some of the genres they employ, and if you do the same, that's great-- but an Afropop primer isn't what Mwamwaya's about here. In drawing lines between older African genres, like highlife, and newer ones, like kwaito, and then linking those to international pop styles of various eras, Warm Heart of Africa pictures a glittering web of connectivity where national and cultural boundaries dissolve. People care about socio-cultural chin-stroking; music does not. This record simply wants to be heard, by whomever will listen and enjoy. There's no cynical play for authenticity, no implication that Afropop is somehow piously cordoned off from Western music. It's a true global-pop album, and a hopeful template for things to come.","The full-length debut from this Afropop project rises to the high standard of their 2008 mixtape; guests include M.I.A. and Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend.

Six,The Black Heart Procession,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6699d034d5c69bf351f/1:1/w_160/87474dfd.jpg,2009-10-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13530-six/,Temporary Residence,"Like costume shops, pumpkin beer, and playoff baseball, the Black Heart Procession are at their peak in the month of October. Adept at pulling off the delicate task of making legitimately unsettling, spooky music without sounding like a novelty, sipping from the BHP's skull-shaped chalice as the weather cools and the nights grow longer is a perfect seasonal accompaniment. So good work guy who schedules Temporary Residence record releases; you deserve a raise. What better way to enjoy my run-up to All Hallow's Eve festivities than with the band so overflowing with dread and gloom they made an album called Amore Del Tropico sound like one of David Lynch's cinematic nightmares? No album title dissonance here, as Black Heart Procession return to the numerical nomenclature of their first three records with Six. But the name on the spine isn't really a tip-off about a return to the band's earlier, sparser approach-- rather, it seems like they just couldn't resist emphasizing the numerology of their sixth album, what with the obvious significance of six-in-triplicate (and yes, I couldn't resist the rating). Sure enough, the devil is all over Six, namedropped as early as the second track, ""Wasteland"", and most of the record's 13 (of course!) songs are drenched in gothic imagery that often veers towards the outright biblical. There's virtually no activity, no matter how mundane, that can't be rendered Dantean by Pall Jenkins, Tobias Nathaniel, and their coven-mates. The extreme up and downs of love are described as no less than Heaven and Hell repeatedly, and scenes of execution and desolation predominate-- it's rock'n'roll for Cormac McCarthy. Singer Pall Jenkins doesn't just get dumped, he gets hung at the gallows and burned at the stake on ""Back to the Underground"". A nighttime city walk turns into a house of urban horrors on ""Rats"", a travel narrative of pimps and alleys and moon-devils that seems a rather harsh and unlikely judgment on the band's hometown of San Diego. Musically, the setting is no less full of darkness and heavy fog. There are a few horror-soundtrack nods-- the obligatory musical saw and funeral-home organ making several appearances, the John Carpenter drum intro of ""Suicide""-- but BHP largely avoid horror-soundtrack cues or cheap scares. Much more subtle and unsettling is the band's piano, walking between beautiful and creepy, or the band's hi-low vocal tricks Ã  la TV on the Radio, where in-control monotone cannot mask the high-pitched, near-hysteria wail hovering above. While nothing could be considered overwrought, one can't help but miss some of the empty space and creaky drum loops that were the cobwebs dressing up Jenkins' dark brooding on their earlier numbered records. In other places, the Black Heart Procession avoid gimmickry by squeezing unexpected dread out of trad-indie sounds. There's an oddly glistening synth snaking through ""Witching Stone"", ""Rats"" has a sinuous bassline cobbled together from the scrap parts of ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"", and ""Forget My Heart"" sounds a helluva lot like... Spoon, who might be the last band I would ever describe as frightening. In more ornate moments, the eerie pizzicato of ""All My Steps"" demonstrates what they can do with a fuller sound, and more lush strings are employed to appropriately melodramatic effect on the hypnotic ""Liar's Ink"". Yet the commendable atmospheric consistency aside, the relentless danse macabre might grow tiresome for the faint of heart, uninterrupted as it is by any islands of contrast. You know that point in a haunted house where you just kind of wish it was over, as the 15th chainsaw/hockey-mask guy jumps out at you from a nook in the plyboard? That's the feeling I get late in Six, when the album reaches a song called, flatly, ""Suicide"" and the heaven-and-hell imagery starts to wear out its welcome with a reprise on ""Last Chance."" For while, the Black Heart Procession does an excellent job of musically embodying October's primary mood, they'd do well to remember that it's a month made more bearable by the occasional flash of Indian summer.","Black Heart pull off the delicate task of making legitimately unsettling, spooky musicÂ without sounding like a novelty-- perfect stuff for this time of year.

Exploding Head,A Place to Bury Strangers,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64cb1335d7bf1698dc8/1:1/w_160/5e528314.jpg,2009-10-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13500-exploding-head/,Mute,"About halfway through Exploding Head you really start to forget why A Place to Bury Strangers sounded so exciting on their self-titled debut two years ago. Not exactly what one wants to hear when talking about an anticipated sophomore release, especially one with a title that promises to literally split your fucking wig, or at very least serve as an alternate soundtrack to Scanners (I'm guessing Melting Face was a little too on-the-nose). While Exploding Head is no washout-- right around ""Keep Slipping Away"", the back half picks up where the debut left off, full of inspired pieces of paranoia-inducing industrial guitar noise and moribund pop textures-- it too often seems like a misguided attempt to connect dots for the listener. On the debut, much of the fun came from sifting through all that ball-retracting dissonance and coming out with handfuls of melodic goop. Here, after eliminating some of the harsher textures in favor of cleanlier, well-positioned rawk tunes, the music is packed with palatable songs that spook instead of uncomfortable ones that seriously unnerve. In other words, if we're still classifying A Place to Bury Strangers as Jesus and Mary Chain revivalists, it's far too early in their career for this to be their Automatic. Head is most assuredly a maturation, from the songwriting right down to the fancy effects-pedal driven magic that frontman Oliver Ackermann is so rightfully lauded for (Ackermann famously crafts customized pedals through his Death By Audio company for artists like TV On the Radio and U2, but has apparently saved some of the coolest tricks for his own band). The band sounds tight, the production full and perfectly drab. So maybe it might seem like a dick move to criticize this record for giving a fuck, but when that white-hot feral intensity only rears its head ever-so-often, the unsubtle influences that anchor Exploding Head (JAMC, My Bloody Valentine, Echo & the Bunnymen) often render songs pancake-flat. For example, on first listen, older stuff like the irrepressibly exciting ""To Fix the Gash in Your Head"" sounded like little more than Wallâ¢E being crammed into a garbage disposal to the tune of ""Upside Down"", and still managed to be frighteningly arresting. Where here, new single ""In Your Heart"" doesn't offer much more than a very impressive facsimile of some of Ian McCullough and Co.'s darker imaginings, well-shaped and completely forgettable. The technical stuff on the record is pretty solid through and through, the band always retaining a much-appreciated limberness even on wishy-washy cuts like ""Lost Feeling"". So when big standouts like ""Ego Death"" (rife with ripping guitars and Nick Cave worshipping sneer) and ""Everything Always Goes Wrong"" (a mean and moody sock-hop jam that contains some of biggest and best pedal work on the album), Head seems like a perfect follow-up, tidier but still as fierce. Yet it's genre-nursed stuff like the noodly post-punk of ""Exploding Head"" or the too cleverly rationed rising power-chord chugs of ""It Is Nothing"" that seem to best represent how quickly that fierceness can dissolve when song structures are laid this plain (albeit still kinda groovy). It soon becomes obvious how important that wall of coronary-clutching noise was, and how painfully rewarding it was to break through it. Head just doesn't put up much of a fight in that respect, revealing it's secrets too fast and too loose. It's more than a little greedy, but by the end of Exploding Head, you can't help but feel a little disappointed to be stuck with a bucket of cleaning products and no viscera to scrape off the walls.","The loud New York band with gothic/shoegaze overtones returns with album number two, which tones down the volume slightly and puts more focus on songwriting.

Losing Feeling,No Age,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65bb1335d7bf1698ded/1:1/w_160/c8ed8b40.jpeg,2009-10-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13516-losing-feeling/,Sub Pop,"When they were first getting started back in 2007, No Age were EP fiends. They released five such missives on five different labels over just a few months, and soon after plucked tracks from them for their first full-length release, Weirdo Rippers. Since then the L.A. guitar-and-drums duo has toured so much, been written about so much, and released such a great album (Nouns), that those initial releases feel a little like ancient relics. No Age's Dean Spunt and Randy Randall have decided to return to the EP, releasing four new tracks now rather than save them for a future long-player. It's a curious move since each sounds album-ready and none are hugely different from previous work, but this band doesn't really deal in long-form anyway-- both Weirdo Rippers and Nouns barely made it past the half-hour mark. It would be cool if these tunes were deemed worthy of an EP because they're a radical departure into dark noise, or a set of HÃ¼sker DÃ¼ covers, or a conceptual suite about the human nervous system. But it's also cool that they're just another solid No Age record. What makes Losing Feeling so solid is how it begins and ends. The opening title track simultaneously floats in place and hurtles forward, recalling the pulsing drift of Nouns' ""Sleeper Hold"". But now the band stretches a bit more, injecting the breaks with a little more tension, a little more bite. And a final rave-up shifts into high gear, turning a nice crescendo into a tidal wave. That infectious wash is matched on the opposite end of the EP by ""You're a Target"". Here the hectic rush of the opener gets drenched in a layer of shimmering guitar tones-- imagine Nouns' ""Brain Burner"" covered by the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Those two blasts would've made a killer 7"", but the moodier songs in between build an intriguing bridge. ""Genie"" marries Randall's slow strumming to Spunt's simple whine, building rhythm without the aid of drums. ""Aim at the Airport"" goes one step further, eschewing both drums and vocals. Its looping guitar could probably fit on something released by Kranky or even Mego, but coming in between two No Age rockers, the wavy fuzz is clearly recognizable. It's not hard to imagine a voice and a drumbeat rising out of this mix were it to go on longer. The same can be said for Losing Feeling as a whole-- had No Age stuck in the studio for a few more hours, this could've easily been a stellar LP. Instead, it leaves little doubt that whenever their Nouns follow-up does emerge, it will have been worth the wait.","Returning to EPs after their incredible first proper LP, No Age inject more tension and shimmering guitars into their already excellent punk rock.

Love 2,Air,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64d9d034d5c69bf34dc/1:1/w_160/b0399180.jpg,2009-10-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13503-love-2/,Astralwerks,"There are a few things I'm impressed with Air for doing: resuscitating crusty, decades-old Moog blorps amidst the frenzy of millennial techno-utopian futurism, turning a new generation on to a certain vintage Gallic notion of jet-set sophistication, and getting indie- and punk-dominated college rock stations to play what essentially amounted to lounge prog. Most of all, there's the way they composed their music as an unapologetically frothy sort of cheese-pop without letting it get dominated by snorting insincerity or self-conscious hokeyness. You could still hear the kitsch, but it wasn't the driving force, and they had a sneaky way of lulling you into forgetting you weren't ""supposed"" to like this kind of thing. Hell, lots of people actually had sex to Moon Safari, which is about as unironic as you can get. (At least I hope they were being unironic.) A half-decade of Balearic/glo-fi/'lude-house has since refined that mellow aesthetic to the point where taste-conscious end-runs around potential irony have become increasingly unnecessary. But while that refinement applied readily to the subtle songcraft of Talkie Walkie and Pocket Symphony, both of which provided ample evidence of Air's vintage pop smarts, they've somehow stumbled their way into a pit of lite-FM treacle on their new album. Love 2-- as titles go, a bad pun disguised as a sequel nobody needed-- is a dopey little slice of not-much that feels like a noodly rendering of yacht-pop weightlessness. Much has been made about Air's new independence in the process of making this album; it's the first one to come out of their new recording studio, Atlas, and the first to be written and recorded without the input of any major outside producers (though they still brought in Moon Safari engineer Stephane ""Alf"" Briat to tinker behind the boards). Far be it from me to accuse Jean-BenoÃ®t Dunckel and Nicolas Godin of being a couple empty vessels who need a Nigel Godrich to whip them into shape, but maybe they could've used someone looking over their shoulders to warn them away from indulging in some bad ideas. Bad ideas like, say, ""Tropical Disease"". This song is the album's longest, worst, and most emblematic of Love 2's problems, nearly seven minutes of malaise that bookends a preciously chipper, tin whistle-punctuated slab of Playskool krautrock with two movements of plastic surgeon's waiting-office Muzak. It's laughably oily when its Econolodge-noir sax oozes in crotch-first, and even more uncomfortable in its second half when Dunckel's pitched-up voice chirps, ""Woman/ Make me feel... warm inside."" God, it's awkward. That empty yet still uncomfortable theme of louche, inarticulate romance is all over the record's ill-advised vocal tracks: pining over a walking (albeit softly walking) clichÃ© in ""So Light Is Her Footfall""; trying to milk intrigue out of the lifeless phrase, ""there is something going on between us,"" in ""You Can Tell It to Everybody""; murmuring about love in ""Love"" (lyrics: ""Love/ Love/ Love/ Love/ Love""). The lyrics read less like the work of someone who didn't grow up speaking English than someone who knows it well and thinks it's kind of a stupid, pointless language. That'd explain the empty, tense-based babble-talk in ""Sing Sang Sung"", at least. Maybe they've always been perpetrators of petty crimes against lyrical songwriting and it's only now that their music's been weak enough to avoid hiding it. The exoticism that made their instantly recognizable brand of music compelling-- the outmoded technology, the unexpected world-music left turns, the almost detached baroqueness-- has been diluted to the point where all their old tricks sound listless. Leadoff track ""Do the Joy"" is maybe the least-botched attempt at doing something new, though its fuzzed-out slo-motion strut is quickly rendered absurd by a ""spooky"" B-movie synthesizer melody. Most everything else runs a diverse gamut of uninspiring retreads: uptempo krautpunk that sounds a bit like The Virgin Suicides standout ""Dead Bodies"" without the intensity (""Be a Bee""), lightheaded, minimalist tweaks of hotel-lounge disco (""Love"", which scans like George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"" in a coma), mid-80s David Bowie with gastrointestinal discomfort (""Missing the Light of the Day""), a half-baked instrumental caricature of Blondie-sans-Debby (""Eat My Beat""), and a couple of pretty unconvincing attempts to incorporate Afrobeat (""Night Hunter"") and township music (""African Velvet""-- I wish I were making up that title). Thing is, it still sounds entirely like an Air album-- just a remarkably bland one. The complementary piano/synth lines that Dunckel and Godin made their stock in trade still dredge up a few legitimately nice melodies, though they typically prove fleeting. And session drummer-turned-auxiliary member Joey Waronker, well, he tries; he's one of the better motorik beat-deployment specialists going, and even he can't jostle much excitement into the proceedings, especially when his job most of the time is to tap out minimalist beats in one of the many tracks that pushes downtempo rhythms into complete stasis. Love 2 exhibits the band's style by just about every familiar metric, except the one that made them fascinating in the first place-- that uncanny ability to make schlock sound beautiful. In its place is a strange reversal: beauty rendered schlock, pop melodies and space-age wonder curdled by damaged whimsy.","The Gallic duo aim to dust off the disappointment of Pocket Symphony with their first LP to beÂ written and recorded without a major outside producer.

There Is No Enemy,Built to Spill,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a676b1335d7bf1698e2b/1:1/w_160/5c1c4f71.gif,2009-10-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13541-there-is-no-enemy/,Warner Bros.,"In the 1990s, they produced some of the most ambitious and resonant indie rock ever made, but in the 2000s, Built to Spill seemed content with merely existing. Following the high-water marks of Perfect From Now On and Keep It Like a Secret, they went into a sort of low-grade creative hibernation, issuing records every three or four years containing a few flashes of genuine inspiration (""Strange"", ""Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss"", ""Goin' Against Your Mind"") surrounded by increasingly aimless jamming. Doug Martsch, the lead singer, guitarist, and creative force behind the band, was beginning to sound like a guy with nothing particularly important left to tell us-- we could stick around, if we wanted, to hear him play his guitar, but the lack of purpose was disconcerting. ""Something is wrong/ Something invisible is gone,"" Martsch crooned on Ancient Melodies of the Future's ""The Host"", and with each successive release, it was hard not to revisit their earlier work in attempts to puzzle out anew what that ""something"" was. On the unexpectedly terrific There Is No Enemy, it becomes immediately clear what had been missing, and sure enough, it was invisible: While Enemy technically sounds just like every Built to Spill record since Keep It Like a Secret-- the pinwheeling guitar fantasias, the ambling tempos, and the wayward vocal lines are all here-- it is buoyed by a fresh sense of emotional stakes, an urgency that puts wind back in the band's sails. For the first time in almost 10 years, it seems that Martsch might actually have something he wants to say. ""Saying something,"" of course, is always a loaded concept with regard to Doug Martsch: He has spent years telling every interviewer who asks that his lyrics contain no personal meaning, that they are chosen more for their meter and suggestiveness than anything else. Ironically, he often seems to be pondering the impossibility of clear communication: ""This strange sound you said I said/ You're not listening or I'm not saying it right,"" he fretted on ""Strange"". ""If there's a word for you, it doesn't mean anything,"" he insisted on Perfect From Now On's ""Velvet Waltz"". All of this misdirection only makes the disarmingly candid, even open-hearted tone of There Is No Enemy more startling. Whether or not the words carry personal weight, Martsch is singing convincingly from the perspective of someone thoroughly humbled by loss. ""Like anyone assuming they know what makes us tick, I was just as wrong as I could be,"" he shrugs on ""Tomorrow"". His shit-eating grin is almost visible when he sings ""Finally decided, and by decide I mean accept/ I won't need all those other chances I won't get"" on ""Life's a Dream"". The loss, of course, remains unspecified-- the only clue we get is ""Pat"", which eulogizes a lost friend-- but its impact can be felt everywhere on Enemy. ""Good Ol' Boredom"" celebrates the arrival of its titular emotional state as a sign that life is returning to normal, a place where ""not so bad/ Seems so great."" On the wounded, fragile ballad ""Things Fall Apart"", meanwhile, Martsch sings ""Stay out of my nightmares, stay out of my dreams/ You're not even welcome in my memories"" in a subdued mutter before delivering a simple, devastating clincher: ""It doesn't matter if you're good or smart-- goddammit, things fall apart."" The inspiration for this sentiment could have come from any number of places-- in the press run-up to this album, Martsch mentioned being influenced by soul music, for example-- but it rings with powerful truth regardless, and produces very real goosebumps. In this context, even their well-worn and comfortable indie jamming feels revitalized. The core lineup of Martsch, Brett Nelson, and Scott Plouf remains unchanged, and they produce the same sound: a majestic, heavy-footed thud, held aloft by Martsch's transcendent guitar work and weightless tenor. But within this framework, they are pushing harder than ever before: witness the cooing ""ooh-la-la"" backup harmonies in ""Life's a Dream"", or the outbreak of horn charts at the song's bridge. Three-quarters of the way into ""Things Fall Apart"", a mariachi trumpet wanders in, seemingly from a Calexico album. ""Pat"", meanwhile, is a blistering, two-and-a-half-minute burst of anger that hearkens back to Martsch's days in Treepeople. But even the straightforward Built to Spill songs are some of the best ones we've heard in a long time: ""Nowhere Lullabye"" and ""Life's a Dream"" are two of the most gorgeously dreamy ballads Martsch has written since ""Else"" or ""Kicked It in the Sun"", and on ""Good Ol' Boredom"", when Martsch finally fires up his shimmering, multihued guitar, the following extended solo workout feels both thrilling and earned. The end result is easily the best Built to Spill album of the decade-- an improbable late-career reawakening and heartening evidence that becoming dependable doesn't mean having to settle for being predictable.","Built to Spill arrest their 2000s slide withÂ the unexpectedÂ There Is No Enemy, their best album in years.

A Strange Arrangement,Mayer Hawthorne,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a652c0084474cd0c092f/1:1/w_160/72215e7b.jpg,2009-10-02 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13508-a-strange-arrangement/,Stones Throw,"A Strange Arrangement, in addition to being the name of Mayer Hawthorne's falsetto-laced debut, also describes the story behind the making of this one-man soul studio. Performing in L.A. as DJ Haircut, Michigan-born hip-hop fan Drew Cohen thought it would be interesting to record his own sample-friendly music. His complicated form of crate digging eventually attracted the ears of Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf. According to a Real Detroit Weekly interview*,* Cohen even turned to the adolescent-approved porn name formula-- his middle name and the street he grew up on-- as a device for creating his sweet soul singer alter ego. When he received a recording contract for what he thought was a single release, he realized Wolf wanted a full-length and had to bunker down, since he ended up writing and recording just about every part on the album himself. It's not as authentic and gritty a bio as those found in the liner notes of many soul reissues. But Hawthorne's on-the-fly origins are fitting for this release, alternately carefree, charming, and sometimes as green as the 29-year-old crooner. Hawthorne's smooth voice draws deeply from the work of legends like Smokey Robinson, Curtis Mayfield, and the Stylistics' Russell Thompkins, Jr. While his naming convention may suggest otherwise, Hawthorne never gets near any R-rated love affairs. Posing in a study surrounded by ephemera on the cover, he sort of looks like a lost Tenenbaum, and plays up a lovelorn, sweet angle throughout the album. He shines brightest on straightforward tracks where he doesn't overplay his hand, instead folding his innocent vocals into catchy, energetic, and unfussy arrangements. He can't match the instrumental chops of Daptone bands or Mark Ronson projects, so he sticks to the basics. Coasting on driving backbeats, feel-good horn and sax melodies, and pleas for passion, ""Your Easy Lovin' Ain't Pleasin' Nothin'"", ""One Track Mind"", and ""Make Her Mine"" are streamlined soul, catchy singles that do right by their obvious 1960s influences. ""The Ills"" nails a Mayfield vibe out of the gate, threading fluid congas among empowering choruses and lyrics about broken levees and single-parent families. ""A Strange Arrangement"" and ""Just Ain't Gonna Work Out"", mid-tempo numbers with more falsetto and apologies for walking away from relationships, showcase blended vocal harmonies. Other than the occasional clockwork backbeat, the closest this comes to Cohen's hip-hop roots is when he slurs ""scared"" so it rhymes with ""bird."" The lovelorn singer doesn't always handle being on the receiving end of a break up quite as well. While lamenting on ""Just Ain't Gonna Work Out"", his syrupy vocals stall a bit, and ""Green Eyed Love"" lumbers along on a half-hearted organ melody and slack rhythm. Hawthorne clearly has the ability to integrate and recreate his influences in his own compositions; it would be revelatory if he added more of his own signature sounds and soul into the music.","

Threats/Worship,Lullabye Arkestra,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a658ea9e61561daa5351/1:1/w_160/e1c11c29.jpg,2009-10-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13513-threatsworship/,Vice,"Despite both having roots in the mid-1990s Montreal indie rock scene, you won't find two brands more diametrically opposed than Constellation Records and Vice. The former built its empire on a stridently anti-corporate ethos and faceless yet politically outspoken orchestral-rock collectives; the latter built theirs on sleazy sensationalism, crass humor, and hipster trendspotting. And yet, these two oppositional entities do share one common value: a love of Lullabye Arkestra. That the Toronto duo have become the first band to release records on both Constellation and Vice's label subsidiary is a testament to their own unifying qualities: comprised of husband/drummer Justin Small and wife/bassist Kat Taylor-Small (that's them you hear screaming out the chorus on Fucked Up's ""Son the Father""), Lullabye Arkestra have parlayed their own holy matrimony into another, decidedly more unholy alliance-- namely, between sweaty 1960s Stax soul and 80s hardcore/speed metal. Not the most obvious attributes for a Constellation signee, but then Small had an easy in with the label: His other band, space-rock ensemble Do Make Say Think (for whom he plays guitar), are Constellation's longest running act. And if Lullabye Arkestra's emergence in 2002 initially posited them as an antidote to Toronto's prevailing collectivist music culture, by the time they recorded their 2006 Constellation release, Ampgrave, they had developed characteristics akin to those of their Can-indie compatriots-- i.e., crowding the stage with multiple string and horn players to lend their minimalist metal more textural depth. But even without a global recession, Lullabye were due for a downsizing; lacking the means to tour with their auxiliary members, the duo found themselves with an album they could barely recreate live as a two-piece. No such problem with the band's Vice debut, Threats/Worship, on which the duo fill in any empty space by loading up on the sort of devastating drop-D riffs that have powered every great bass/drums two-piece from godheadSilo to Death From Above 1979, and screaming their lungs out. If Ampgrave lent Lullabye's tortured soul a B-movie, haunted-house ambiance, Threats/Worship is pure grindhouse grit-- ugly, brutal, yet thrilling as all hell. And yet, even with the stripped-down set-up and brief, 36-minute run time, Threats/Worship still feels weighty and substantial, thanks to an epic, Black Flag-burning introduction, ""Get Nervous"", that effectively welcomes us into their nightmare and showcases the duo's ability to shift gears between slow-motion sludge and high-speed hysterics. Lullabye Arkestra know that, given their low overhead, the slightest dynamic variations go a long way-- the subtle synth swirls lurking in the background of circle-pit stoker ""Surviving the Year of Wolves"" (featuring guest barking from ex-Cursed frontman Chris Colohan); the Tony Iommi accents that punctuate the fist-pump chorus of ""We Fuck the Night""; the echo-effected vocals and hypnotic riff repetition that inject ""Fog Machine"" with a psychedelic expanse; the surprise ending of ""This Is a Storm"", which fools us into thinking it's fading out before returning for one last, Carrie-style scare. Where there was once a cheeky quality to the Smalls' vocal interplay-- part Ike and Tina, part Mickey and Mallory-- Threats/Worship doesn't play up any kind of he-said/she-said sexual tension. Rather, their unison, hoarse-voice howls convey a genuine, shared feeling of release and solidarity. This is no more apparent than on ""Voodoo"", a rerecording of the first song the Smalls ever wrote together-- when the duo start maniacally shrieking, ""baby baby baby!"" you're not sure if they want to have one or eat one. Clocking in at just 44 seconds, the song both heralds Lullabye's return to their original two-piece formation, while also serving as a signpost for how much they've evolved. The lesson here: The couple that stays together slays together.","Latest from a Toronto band so easy to love they've been released by both the anti-corporate people at Constellation and the trendspotters at Vice.

I and Love and You,The Avett Brothers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6405e6ef95969320cbc/1:1/w_160/8cac9e6c.jpg,2009-10-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13478-i-and-love-and-you/,ColumbiaAmerican,"Do the Avett Brothers ever wake up feeling cranky? Mean-spirited? Less than generous? Their songs all communicate an unfailingly chummy earnestness that stems from candid introspection and unbidden love for their fellow man, and perhaps more than their brotherly harmonies or their rambunctious take on string-band Americana, that sincerity is their chief appeal. Of late, however, the Avetts' self-reckoning has grown so overbearing that it borders on obsession and threatens to limit their musical range. I and Love and You, their sixth studio album, doesn't break from their monolithic solemnity, but actually intensifies it: The hook on ""Ten Thousand Words"" goes, ""Ain't it like most people, I'm no different, we love to talk on things we don't know about."" On ""The Perfect Space"", they sing in sharp harmony: ""I want to have friends who love me for the man I become, not the man that I was."" There's a similar potential yearbook quote in every song-- every verse, just about-- and after a while, you may begin to wish they'd get angry about something, or, god forbid, crack an ironic joke. I and Love and You is a crucial album for the band. One of the biggest grassroots success stories of the decade, they spent years self-releasing albums and self-promoting shows to gradually growing audiences, eventually signing to North Carolina indie label Ramseur before moving up to Sony/BMG/Columbia Records. For their major-label debut, the trio (which includes brothers Scott and Seth and unrelated bass player Bob Crawford) worked with producer Rick Rubin, whose involvement gives the album added critical and commercial cache. With a large and loyal fanbase, they could be as big as Dave Matthews and bring string-band rootsiness to the mainstream. Or not. One thing is for sure: After I and Love and You, they can no longer go back to being the Avett Brothers they once were. As a major-label debut, the album plays to one set of their strengths while ignoring others. The Avetts continue to emphasize bold melodic lines, emphatic performances, and lyrics whose self-criticism is so magnanimous it becomes a form of self-praise. ""And It Spread"" moves from gentle to raucous the way more pedestrian bands do quiet-loud, and ""January Wedding"" is so delicate it nearly blows away in its own breeziness. These songs draw less from the celebratory energy of Mignonette and Emotionalism-- rambling albums whose spirited imperfections made them all the more endearing-- and more from the recent Gleam EPs, which showcased a calmer, more polite acoustic craftsmanship. That trend may predate Rubin's involvement, but here it sounds like a product of the Beard's approach to Americana, which is unerringly clean, sparse, and tasteful. Every instrument sounds perfectly placed, and that's a shame because the Avetts got more mileage out of their rough edges than most bands this decade. Buffing away their rough edges and rowdy quirks, Rubin establishes a mood of intense pensiveness even on the first song, when they announce they're getting no sleep till Brooklyn. The title track builds carefully as the brothers ask the borough to welcome them, carefully adding an instrument or two with each verse until the song reaches its destination-- a big, cathartic finale. Most of the songs that follow employ a similar technique: opening with a soft acoustic intro, then inserting other sounds to underline the sentiments. It's effective until it becomes predictable, but later in the album, ""Laundry Room"" plays around with that formula, following a winding path from a gentle near-ballad (marred only by the lyric ""I am a breathing time machine"") as it transforms into a swirling bluegrass jam that's one of the album's finest moments. There are surprisingly durable hooks on the stand-out ""Tin Man"" and the upbeat ""Slight Figure of Speech"", which, back to back, make the second half much livelier and more tenacious than the first. Rubin allows the Avetts to expand their sound and indulge these pop urges, but not always to great effect. With its jaunty piano theme and insistent screaming, ""Kick Drum Heart"" tries for Wilco but achieves Guster. Generally, there's a refinement to I and Love and You that seems slightly out of step for a group that has built an audience on performances and recordings that sound rawly spontaneous and heartfelt; breathlessly conveying their positive message has always been more crucial than deciding where to put the banjo or how prominent to make the strings. These songs, on the other hand, are more purposeful, more written, more professional. It's not that there's no room for such studio nuance in the Avetts' music, but it gives I and Love and You a quotidian sheen, making their signature sincerity seem sappy and much less special.","One of the biggest grassroots success stories of the decade makes their well-deserved, Rick Rubin-assisted major-label bow.

My Weakness Is Strong,Patton Oswalt,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a664c0084474cd0c0956/1:1/w_160/43807fe1.jpg,2009-10-02 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13524-my-weakness-is-strong/,Warner Bros.,"The new Patton Oswalt album has jokes about air travel and childbirth and unused exercise equipment. The comedian who once railed against the tedious self-satisfaction of AA members and new parents talks about how he's going to cut down on drinking and drugs for the sake of his soon-to-be-born child. He even opens My Weakness Is Strong with a funny but relatively low-key observation on the pitfalls of text messaging auto-complete features, wherein he recalls a moment where he responded to his wife's message of ""I love you"" with the accidental deployment of what he claims is his most-used sentence-starter, ""I hate"". For a man who closed Feelin' Kinda Patton with the most surreal tableaux of Robert Evans-narrated 1970s Hollywood sex imaginable and wrung a Terry Southern-rivaling amount of morbid, horror-struck comedy out of the mere existence of KFC's Famous Bowl in Werewolves and Lollipops, this album seems like a wary step towards maturation. At least until you remember that ""maturation"" is typically most useful in comedy terms as a euphemism for ""becoming complacent and unfunny,"" which My Weakness Is Strong is all kinds of not. Everything that made Patton Oswalt the funniest stand-up comedian of the last five years is still present and accounted for on his latest album, and it'd be missing the mark to shortchange it under the assumption that he's softened. There's moments of giddy enthusiasm and bewilderment that occasionally temper Oswalt's finely-tuned sense of bitter, aggravated disappointment with himself and the rest of society; the most memorable bit of unbridled optimism is when he brings up the exquisitely nerdy realization that the election of Barack Obama means he doesn't have to go that far back in time to blow his younger self's mind. But when he ties the introduction of ""grocery robot"" technology to the downward spiral of a cashier's meth-addled life or frames his battle with depression in the context of being used as post-apocalyptic sex-currency, you can still feel all the serrated edges in his comedy digging into you. The thing that's always made even the harshest and bleakest moments in Oswalt's comedy into repeat-listen material is his almost supernatural knack for warping the most uncomfortable concepts into perfectly pitched linguistic absurdity. Some comedians might stop at the evocative-enough concept of stumbling into an aborted orgy in the process of house-hunting, and Patton's eye for ridiculous detail-- the awkward teenage ""Craigslist hookup"" wearing the hastily-procured girls' ""Juicy"" sweatpants backwards, and his subsequent awkward exit out the back into an endless expanse of Hollywood Hills foliage-- serves it well, but it's the way he describes the house's atmosphere as ""fogbanks of twat mist"" and the forest-bound teenager as ""Fucksquatch"" that makes it stick in your head like a particularly memorable guitar riff. With Oswalt, it's not just his demeanor or his geeky obsessions that define him, it's the way he unspools these phrases for maximum rhythmic effect; I don't think I've come across any song lyric this year as inextricable from my skull as Oswalt phrases like ""Uncle Touchy's naked puzzle basement"" or ""free government blowjob robot."" And while Patton can get a ton of mileage out of his unexpected detours into deconstructing the Christian/Pagan symbolism in Lucky Charms or going on one of his now-characteristic descriptions of horrifying fat-people foodstuffs, it's his ability to draw inspiration from tilled-to-death comedic soil-- like his air travel/baby/treadmill bits-- that reveal Patton as a bottomless well of cultural enthusiasm. And not just pop culture, though he's pretty damn near encyclopedic in that department, but something greater-- an observational sharpness that pushes his work above mere didja-ever-noticeisms. Oswalt's previous release, Werewolves and Lollipops, is a hard act to follow-- it's the one album I want to preserve for a disapproving future cruelly awaiting to pin our era's comedy on LOLcats and ""edgy"" ventriloquists-- and My Weakness Is Strong doesn't quite boast its predecessor's relentless momentum. But the safe, boring dad that Oswalt once threatened to become in order to make sure his kid would grow up to rebel? There's no sign of him anywhere.","Patton Oswalt is now more mature and even grown-up, but everything that makes him the funniest stand-up around is still in place on his new album.

Hello Nasty [Deluxe Edition],Beastie Boys,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a667c0084474cd0c095d/1:1/w_160/4cd15d35.jpg,2009-10-02 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13527-hello-nasty-deluxe-edition/,Capitol,"Even more so than career high-point Paul's Boutique, Hello Nasty tries to squeeze in every interesting record, old or new, that passed through the Beastie Boys' orbit at its time of recording. So why is one album considered a masterpiece while the other belongs in the bottom end of the band's catalog, just above the tedious instrumental EPs and second-rate hardcore? For one thing, Hello Nasty lacks the energy of almost every other Beasties album. It's got all these sounds to work with, that little-bit-of-everything agglomeration that characterized the late-1990s underground's listening habits: electro, drum'n'bass, lounge, folk, turntablism, tropicalia, dub. Basically anything you'd find in the collection of a given member of Tortoise. But the further the album strays from straight-up hip-hop, the less excited it sounds to do anything with these new influences. That makes it sound like a chore, and it is, albeit intermittently. At 22 tracks, Hello Nasty is less boundary-pushing, carefully collaged risk-taking than the excess that comes from unlimited home studio time and no fear of mercenary label owners or turncoat audiences. ""Song for the Man"" is the first real evidence of the trio's slide into overextended, self-satisfied slackness. When you take the kitchen-sink approach to making an album, you better make damn sure you bring your A-game to each idea you try. It's not like the Beasties lacked the chops or wit to turn ""Song for the Man"" into something worth listening to. And there's nothing wrong with froth for frat boys, provided there's a hook. But this little-too-laid-back hip-hop lite is barely a song. Even the Beastie's post-Paul's instrumental funk noodles had more bite. It sounds all the weaker coming from a band whose prime draw was a exuberance, even mania. Sounding lazy rather than effortless or playful is a bad look for any band-- especially when you've previously prided yourself on proving a don't-give-a-fuck-attitude is compatible with hardcore studio experimentation and pop savvy. If the Beasties anticipated so much of the cut-and-paste hip-hop sound on Paul's Boutique, then why does their contribution to the downtempo glut, passably whimsical instrumental interlude ""Sneakin' Out the Hospital"", sound less like elders schooling their disciples than three aging magpies trying to keep up with the Ninja Tunes and Mo' Waxes? Elsewhere, the Beasties fall into the usual traps that beset smart dudes with wide ears, a lot of heart, and plenty of industry clout: go-nowhere studio trickery (murky mumblefest ""Flowin' Prose""); eye-rolling heart-on-sleeve earnestness (MCA channeling George Harrison's high guru era on ""I Don't Know""); and of course your standard case of guest star-itis. If you can make it through the starstruck Boys' inability to reign in Lee ""Scratch"" Perry's ramblings on ""Dr. Lee, PhD"", well, you've got a stronger stomach for superstars kowtowing to their heroes than I do. The good bits tend to stick to what the Beasties do best-- hyperactive rhyme-lobbing with more bad puns than a MAD magazine sub-editor and a brain-melting overload of one pop-cult ref after another-- with a pre-millennium dancefloor sheen. Thankfully pre-millennium dancefloors-- some of them, at least-- were increasingly in thrall to the recycled rigidity of old-school electro. So you get the Beasties keeping current by referencing the sounds that reared them when they were hip-hop obsessed hardcore kids. Unsurprisingly, the Boys rarely fumble when playing with a sound they'd been loving and perfecting over a decade. It was also-- lest we forget-- the era of dunderheaded big beat and jungle's last gasp of crowd-pleasing jump-up dumbness. The Beasties were clearly trawling New York's import bins in the months before they laid down Hello Nasty, making the live-from-London remixes of tracks like Fatboy Slim's rework of ""Body Movin'"" (included on the bonus disc) almost superfluous. The original album tracks have all of the club-centric subgenres' antic energy, plus plenty of trademark Beasties stupid-unto-genius wordplay to make them more than dance comp filler. Ad-Rock rhyming, ""I'm the king of Boggle/ There is none higher"" with ""quagmire"" tends dangerously close to both being show-offy and plain cringeworthy. But I'm smiling as I roll my eyes, so I guess he wins. Elsewhere things get odder, less predictable in the good way. ""The Negotiation Limerick File"" and ""Electrify"" don't fit the party-hard schema, but they're good reminders of the sonic diversity of the era's not-quite-mainstream hip-hop. And ""Three MC's and One DJ"", where Mix Master Mike offers a late-1990s turntablism master-class handily condensed to the length of a single, makes me long for that brief moment when Wire-reading avant-heads shared common ground with straight-up b-boys, the pleasure principle of hip-hop colliding with a noise head's preference for abstract expressionism. The length of the bonus disc nearly rivals the original's length (21 tracks to the parent album's 22) and contains mostly cutting-room excerpts and drag-assy alternate mixes. Oh boy, an even more meandering ""dub mix"" of ""Dr. Lee, PhD""! There are plenty of short snippets of heavy, kitschy jams where the Beasties indulge their love for the muddy, slo-mo funk of the mid-70s. Get ready for a lot of blaxploitation-in-two-minutes-or-less like ""Dirty Dog"" and ""Aunt Jackie Poom Poom Delicious"". As far as the bonus instrumentals go, only the porn-ready mystical mumbo-jumbo minimalism of ""The Drone"" and the pensive quasi-rock of ""Creepin'"" justify running the tape past two minutes. And the bulk of the remixes by other artists are inessential, save the stop-and-go stutter-funk Colleone and Webb's ""Intergalactic"", compelling because it never quite seems to gel with the original. For an album already in need of a stern editor's hand, the bonus disc just reinforces the impression that the Hello Nasty-era Beasties were bursting with interesting starting points they never bothered to see to completion. I remember loving Hello Nasty at the time in part because it was so much, even the undercooked bits and gimpy hippie schlock. Hell, there were still plenty of tracks left to justify the sticker shock of the just-prior-to-MP3s new CD. But it's hard hearing the positives in such a shapeless mush of half-formed sorta-songs with the weary ears of the post-iTunes playlist compiler. Let alone bothering to pay for it again in full. As an object in itself, we've got the album we've got, and that means assessing the whole unshapely mass/mess, the of-the-moment experiments with the actual tunes worth keeping a decade-plus later. And that whole, less a glorious mess than the exhausting sort, is the least essential Beasties disc until we hit the new millennium.","With 43 tracks spread over two discs, the latest deluxe version from the Beasties catalog suffers from some of the same lack of editing as the original did.

One collection of EPs and two full albums later (and newly signed to TBD Records), the band has pretty much stayed the course, adding some orchestral flourishes to a few songs on new LP Threadbare, but generally hewing to its acoustic guitar/secular spiritual awakening formula. That steadiness includes recycling older songs like jangly Celtic jig-like ""Tree Bones"", which has now appeared on three different Port O'Brien releases. Like half of Threadbare's tracks (most of them produced by Earlimart's Aaron Espinoza), including ""Oslo Campfire"" and ""Leap Year"", ""Tree Bones"" winds its way to a rousing refrain that lyrically and musically promotes an optimistic combo of self reliance and a little help from your friends. If that sounds facile, it actually isn't. And if Port O'Brien's general vibe isn't as au courant in 2009 as it was in 2006, the band has firmly established the group-hug aesthetic as their own and proven that they're no trend chasers. ""Band"" is a bit of a misnomer, though. At Port O'Brien's core are part-time musicians Van Pierszalowski and Cambria Goodwin, who work every summer in Alaska-- he on his dad's commercial salmon fishing boat and she as a baker in little Larsen Bay's only cannery. Unlike say, the Decemberists, Port O'Brien earn their seafaring references the old-fashioned way, and the constant stream of swells and salt water never come across as affected grabs at working-class or folk-tradition authenticity. The duo live the remainder of the year in Northern California and add temporary band members as needed for recording and touring. They recruited Papercuts' Jason Quever-- increasingly the Bay Area's go-to guy for touring, session work, and engineering-- to produce approximately half of Threadbare. Quever typically wraps his own bedroom pop in muffled melancholy, and his cabin-fevered touch is suited to the record's more emotionally nuanced, Goodwin-sung numbers, like the bookend variations of ""High Without the Hope"", and the dirgey ""(((Darkness Visible)))"". Goodwin's brother died just as Port O'Brien were starting to work on the album, and while death doesn't overwhelm the record, it's a constant presence, sitting quietly in the corner and informing Goodwin's sweet but weary voice. But these guys just aren't the types to dwell on any kind of downer. The warm, punchy ""Love Me Through"", sequenced immediately after ""Darkness"", announces, ""Now it's time for healing."" And on the record's best earworm, ""Sour Milk/Salt Water"", a relatively big-sounding production of digital manipulation and swollen multi-tracked vocals, Pierszalowski sings, ""I don't have a trust fund/ If the luck don't come/ It could be a cold one/ All through the winter,"" with a characteristically blasÃ© shrug. If you're sick of hearing privileged kids whine about their non-problems (or celebrate their privilege), Threadbare's a breath of fresh, sea air.","Like the progeny of California's new folkies and Arcade Fire's euphorics, Port O'Brien still hewÂ to an acoustic guitar/secular spiritual awakening formula.

You pick up on the ""fucked"" pretty quick when you're listening to Times New Viking; of this newish lo-fi crop, they're the finest melodicists by some margin, melodies they're more than willing to step on in service of the skronk. But there's no such note on Born Again Revisited, the band's fourth, nor is there Rip It Off's urging to ""please play loud.""

Whatever their motives,Â Born Again Revisited finds theseÂ old pros hanging out in the red, further refining their sound to buck the trends that have built up around them. Because they take such pains to obscure vocals, blow out drums, make one guitar sound like 40, and generally do everything in their power to piss off your speakers, it's easy to miss what sharp, funny, self-deprecating songwriters Times New Viking can be, a failing Born Again Revisited seems hell-bent on solving. Ignoring their obvious gifts as tunesmiths is just a touch harder here, as practically everything's been given a bit more space to itself, the enveloping crunch of Rip It Off replaced with a fizzy, reedy haze that puts a tad more focus on the songs themselves. Although every Times New Viking release to date has sported at least one truly knockout tune, the highs here might be the band's most dizzying yet. There's shitgaze anthem ""No Time, No Hope"", one of the year's catchiest bumouts-- a little organ-driven fury propelled by Beth Murphy and Adam Elliott's weirdly complimentary vocals and a burst of pure energy. There's the streaky ""Move to California""-- a maudlin request if there ever was one-- middle-fi in its production and resigned in its apparent yearning. And there's the 1-2 of the plaintive, beautiful Murphy-led ""These Days"" and the ripcord Rollins dedication ""(No) Sympathy"", the band's single finest stretch on wax. All four tunes-- and a few others besides, like the weary, hilariously titled ""2/11 Don't Forget""-- take the obvious pleasures of Rip It Off's ""(My Head)"" and ""Faces on Fire"", strip back some of the peal, turn the sloganeering outward and turn up the lyrical detail, and emerge triumphant. Erm, as triumphant as a song called ""No Time, No Hope"" can be, I suppose. Beyond a slight downward nudge of the volume knob, the biggest difference between Born Again Revisited and its predecessors is a lean towards the punk side of pop-punk; the tempos are by and large faster, the shout-along choruses more shibboleth and slightly less stoney, the little flashes of melody harder to grasp. Elements of either have shown themselves all over the TNV discography, but whereas on Rip It Off they'd fill in the gaps between the big numbers with sketches of pop tunes-- generally little more than an organ bleat, a guitar rumble, and Beth Murphy's wail, but insidiously catchy nonetheless-- here they're filling the space with scrappy little screamers that seem to pass by faster than even their brief runtimes. It's a pretty good look-- not far in spirit from the 10 terrific, tumult-ridden minutes of last year's Stay Awake EP. There's still a great deal of melody, and small moments-- the steamy organ crunch on the title track, the slap of Adam Elliott's drum on woozy singalong ""Half Day in Hell""-- stand out, but the peaks tower over the valleys here, and as such, the album's internal logic occasionally feels wonky, lopsided. Whereas Rip It Off, after the initial learning curve, was a fairly easy album to sink into, Born Again Revisited is lumpier, dodgier, and in some ways even more fucked. Good on them, you know? Now would've been a pretty good time for Times New Viking to crank out a mess of beery bouncers or thinly-veiled Clean covers and let that Matador money roll in. But that's pretty much exactly what Born Again Revisited isn't. Instead, we've got yet another standoffishly catchy, completely uncompromising bit of burnout ephemera from a band that predates a revived trend I'm certain they feel themselves outside of. Born Again Revisited is a deeply rewarding record and a worthy entry in a pretty stellar catalog, sure, but coming at a time when everybody's fucking up their tunes and only a few are really doing it well, it's reassuring to know we weren't silly for getting excited about this stuff all over again.","Matador band's highest-fidelity album to date, an intentional playing down of the things that made them among lo-fi's leading lights.

Milwaukee at Last!!!,Rufus Wainwright,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65c13d1975652139181/1:1/w_160/60bf4a0e.jpg,2009-10-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13517-milwaukee-at-last/,Decca,"Milwaukee at Last!!! is Rufus Wainwright's second live album, but it might as well be his first. In 2007, Rufus Does Judy Live at Carnegie Hall documented his song-for-song and nearly banter-for-banter restaging of Judy Garland's infamous 1961 performance, and Wainwright's slavish devotion to her performance made it an act of impersonation rather than interpretation. He was living his own dream of pop stardom; it was an odd affair, since his primary audience ultimately was himself. Wainwright hints at that same stagey role-playing early on in Milwaukee at Last!!! As the audience at the Pabst Theater applauds his grandiloquent version of opener ""Release the Stars"", he declares, with mock humility, ""Thank you. I wasn't expecting that."" Of course he was expecting that. Who doesn't expect applause? But soon the show loosens up and Wainwright plays the role he was born to play: himself. He runs through ""Going to a Town"" and ""Sanssouci"" with all the debonair insouciance that he made his name on, and his agile seven-man backing band smoothly inflates the bombast of ""Release the Stars"" and ""Rules and Regulations"". It loses a bit of steam in the second set, when he gives too much time over to big, plodding numbers like the medley ""Not Ready to Love/Slideshow"" and a cover of the early 19th century Irish ballad ""Macushla"" But he recovers with closer ""Gay Messiah"", a Want Two stand-out whose porn-religious imagery makes it a fitting closer. Where do you go from there? At times Milwaukee at Last!!! sounds like a retrospective of Wainwright's 2000s, beginning-- Â sadly-- not with 2000's career-high Poses but with the Want albums, which introduced a more operatic, more staged approach. That headier style, which at its best seemed like the logical extension of his lyrics about gay desire, confusion, and contentment, actually increased his audience rather than drive away listeners, which I guess makes him something of a straight icon. Of course Milwaukee at Last!!! only seems broader than it is: Almost every track, it turns out, is from Release the Stars, and the audience doesn't seem to mind. A second version of the album includes a DVD of the entire performance-- all 23 songs and stage banter excised from the CD, along with performances from the Montreux Jazz Festival-- and that's the better way to experience Wainwright live. Visuals are crucial: His outfit looks like a Nudie suit for Max Headroom and shows off his well-tanned torso; his band treat the large collection of broaches like religious icons; the enormous black-and-white American flag backdrop gives ""Going to a Town"" extra impact; and, perhaps most importantly, crowd shots show the audience hanging on his every note. Between songs, Wainwright boasts about having ""incredible sex"" with Brandon Flowers, and backstage between sets he jokes with his boyfriend JÃ¶rn while stripping down for a costume change. He seems much more psyched to be in front of a camera than in front of a mic. More crucially, the DVD contains some of the best songs, which throws the album proper into sharp relief. Where the shorter tracklist favors ponderous numbers, the full show intersperses those songs with the rollicking ""Between My Legs"" (featuring Wainwright perched atop JÃ¶rn's shoulders), the booming ""Do I Disappoint You"", the wittily apocryphal ""The Art Teacher"". It's not just that it's a longer setlist, but a broader one, more well-rounded and revealing, although both the CD and the DVD end with Wainwright, now clad in lederhosen, blowing the same sweetly sincere smooch to the audience, which may be the only way to top ""Gay Messiah"".","His second live album, but first covering his own material, this CD/DVD set findsÂ Rufus Wainwright playing the role he was born to play: himself.

Man on the Moon: The End of Day,Kid Cudi,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64eb1335d7bf1698dcc/1:1/w_160/224b0b26.jpg,2009-10-01 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13504-man-on-the-moon-the-end-of-day/,Universal MotownGOODDream On,"Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak was undoubtedly a divisive record, but a rare one where it felt like both sides were essentially making the same argument: We care about it because it was made by Kanye West. It's a backhanded compliment, acknowledging that everything he does is a vital listen but also that it would be tougher to overlook the LP's glaring flaws had it come from someone who hadn't built up a decade of goodwill through his musical work and personal transparency. No wonder Kid Cudi threatened to retire before he even put out Man on the Moon: The End of Day-- his debut essentially exists because of a record that drew most of its power from a singular cult of personality, and that's a lot to live up to. Cudi co-wrote several tracks on 808s (most notably guesting on ""Welcome to Heartbreak""), and combined with hits in Drake's ""Best I Ever Had"" and Cudi's own ""Day 'N' Nite"", the commercial resiliency of that album proved that fad or not, this sadsack backpack stuff is here to stay. But whereas 808s was a record about a very public figure attempting a retreat he'd be incapable of sustaining, Man on the Moon uses quotidian, lonely stoner turmoil as a means of introduction. Now, I still check for Atmosphere projects and I've got a functioning knowledge of the Get Up Kids' discography, so I can't knock Man on the Moon for skewing emo. And we won't play the hipster card, since this record lives and dies by its lyrics as much as any document of spit-these-bars formalism. The problem is how these two impulses feed off each other in all the wrong ways, with Cudi inverting the songwriting process so that a supposed pursuit of honesty is rendered predatory and manipulative. ""I got some issues that nobody can see,"" goes the hook to ""Soundtrack 2 My Life"", and it's a boast as grandiose as you're likely to hear in 2009. Throughout, Cudi's issues could not be rendered in a more clumsy or obvious way, blowing up every slight perceived or real (""had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them"") into trials of such mythical proportions that it needs a bogus four-part ""plot"" (Cudi is sad, does mushrooms, starts to get famous, is still sad) and narration from Common. Cudi also slathers his verses with a flat warble that Auto-Tune was made to salvage. It would be numbing enough on its own, but nearly every 30 seconds there's some terrifyingly underwritten lyric to jolt you into sharp pangs of embarrassment. He's referred to as ""our hero"" throughout Man on the Moon, and his superpower is managing to convey unlimited amounts of :-( while staying firmly in his vocab-stunted ""sorrow""-""tomorrow""/ ""room""-""moon"" wheelhouse of rhymes. ""Look at me/ You tell me just what you see/ Am I someone whom you may love/ Or enemy,"" goes a particularly Brandon Flowers-like line of the otherwise effectively spare ""Mr. Solo Dolo (Nightmare)"". As far as rap metaphors go, Cudi is Katrina with no FEMA: ""I live in a cocoon/ Opposite of Cancun/ Where it is never sunny/ Dark side of the moon,"" or, even more pointedly, ""Gray clouds up above, man/ Metaphor to my life, man."" But what's most frustrating of all is that Cudi can make Man on the Moon feel like a missed opportunity instead of a non-starter. His hooks have a way of burrowing into your brain-- you already know the deal with ""Day 'N' Nite"", and ""Simple As..."" bears a strange resemblance to ""Semi-Charmed Life"" but damn if I'll be able to forget it any time soon. He's also got a really keen ear for sounds: ""Mr. Solo Dolo"" nods to the warped Orientalism from Silent Shout's quieter tracks and you almost wish the tangible warmth emanating from the strings on ""In My Dreams"" would reveal itself in something other than a somnambulant intro. Cruelest of all, the album goes a long ways towards redeeming itself with its final two tracks-- ""Hyyerrr"" nods to the haziest productions from DJ U-Neek while ""Up Up & Away"" unabashedly makes its alt-rock intentions known with jarringly optimistic acoustic guitars. It makes you think things could get better if Cudi manages to cheer up in the future (and why not? Man on the Moon is the rare record in 2009 that's beating sales expectations), but then we might just end up with more songs like ""Enter Galactic"" and ""Make Her Say"", the ""Poker Face"" remake where Cudi, 'Ye, and Common play misogynistically against type for laughs and somehow make you feel bad for Lady Gaga. Even with ""Stapleton Sex"" and ""Gihad"" making the rounds recently, it's probably still the most noxious sex rap I've managed to hear in some time. Cudi would like to think this record is critic-proof, or at least that's what I cull from his decision to paraphrase the ""there will always be somebody who will shoot down any dream"" line from Kanye's ""Bring Me Down"". But that number up there isn't a judgment of Cudi's pain, as much as it is an ability to express it-- being misunderstood in the Midwest and lost in the big city will never fail to inspire phenomenal art in twentysomethings, but Cudi too often assumes some sort of higher ground even though his self-pity is flaunted no differently than any other tacky rapper accessory.","After co-writing several tracks with Kanye West and hits with Crookers, Kid Cudi releases his long-awaited debut album.

White Lunar,Nick Cave and Warren Ellis,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a650c0084474cd0c0929/1:1/w_160/8cb6a2f0.jpg,2009-10-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13505-white-lunar/,Mute,"The soundtrack is a curious artform. Where most other art is in some way primary, an experience of its own, an original film score is secondary-- it serves something larger. For this reason, a lot of soundtrack music doesn't stand on its own absent the film. It simply isn't meant to do that. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, longtime collaborators in the Bad Seeds, understand this-- their collaborative film scores are sensitive to the needs of scene and character, but they also create scores so richly textured and evocative that they work divorced from their films. White Lunar gathers two discs' worth of the pair's soundtrack work, as well as four short archival instrumentals named for craters on the moon. The work is understandably different from what they do in the Bad Seeds, hewing closer to Ellis' other band, the Dirty Three. The discs divide the music thematically: Disc One contains pieces from the scores of John Hillcoat's The Proposition (2005), Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), and Hillcoat's as-yet unreleased adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road; Disc Two is filled with more under-the-radar work, including the four archival pieces, music from Geoffrey Smith's 2007 documentary The English Surgeon, a film about Dr. Henry Marsh's work training Ukrainian neurosurgeons, and music from Matthew Watson's recent documentary The Girls of Phnom Penh, which follows three Cambodian sex workers in an attempt to reveal the country's ""virginity trade."" Absent any particularly uplifting subject matter, the discs naturally adopt an elegiac tone, dominated by sparse piano and Ellis' often thrilling violin playing. The first disc is remarkably unified, playing almost like a long album in spite of the three sources. The six-minute ""Song for Bob"", which features Ellis layered into a whole string section and accompanied by nothing more than a bit of bass and piano, captures the essence of the inner conflict of a man confronted by the ugly reality of a man he idolized, while the theme from Jesse James is pensive and lovely. The Proposition theme features hard scraping from Ellis over a sickly drone, building a tone of dread for the violence to come. A couple of vocal songs stick out-- ""Gun Thing"" is so understated, the vocals barely feel different from an instrument, but Cave's wounded croak does much for ""The Rider Song"". He whispers sinisterly on ""The Rider No. 2"", doubling himself with muted singing as the music squeals queasily around him, but the duo eases back a bit on the next track, ""Martha's Dream"", where Ellis quotes an old Dirty Three song in the second half. Obviously, it's impossible to say yet how well the music from The Road matches the tone of the film, but if this is any indication, it will be bleak, beautiful, and deliberate. I confess I've not seen the documentaries scored on Disc Two, but Cave and Ellis have developed a distinctive soundtrack voice that carries over into these films. The English Surgeon features a clutch of brief, gently shifting soundscapes led by solo violin, certainly much prettier than titles like ""Brain Retractor"" and ""Rat's Tooth Forceps"" might imply (though the latter has a nervous undercurrent of overdubbed violin). Phnom Penh is more varied: ""Srey Leak"" is an eerie, creeping intro to the disc, and ""Me Nea"" is an emotionally collapsed short piece. Finally, the four archival pieces reveal some of the pair's textural explorations-- ""Magma"" is the most interesting, featuring Ellis singing, pitch-shifted and layered into something alien and only fleetingly recognizable as a voice. Cave and Ellis clearly share an aesthetic sympathy that allows them to key in together on the emotional undertow of their subjects, crafting haunting atmospheres to reflect the sweeping cinematography of the feature films they soundtrack as well as the inner lives of the documentary subjects. So does it hold up on its own? Mostly, it does. This doesn't eclipse their non-soundtrack work by any stretch of the imagination, and it occasionally lapses into texture that longs for its visual component, but by and large it's an involving listen that telegraphs a sense of emotional and geographic space. It's good to have it all in one place.","Nick Cave and Dirty Three/Bad Seeds member Warren Ellis collect two discs of soundtrack work, including pieces from the new adaptation of The Road.

LOVEWORLD,United State of Electronica,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5535e6ef95969320a99/1:1/w_160/320a7d1b.jpg,2009-09-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13294-loveworld/,Mannheim,"In the time since pitching and being assigned this album, there have been very negative developments across the board in my life, and in the lives of my immediate family. I am not mentioning this because I want your attention and sympathy. I bring this up because this record by U.S.E. is an aggressively joyful and optimistic set of songs, and very much the sort of thing where someone might say, ""It's impossible not to feel happy while listening to this music!"" Well, let me tell you: Even though the band is doing everything they can to push my glee buttons, it has not been working. I don't think that it is entirely their fault. The band, who wisely shortened their name from the rather unwieldy United State of Electronica in the five years since the release of their debut album, specialize in evoking delirious bliss and positive vibes by melding the style of post-Daft Punk house music, twee indie rock, and a sort of ""Sesame Street""-esque funk. Their formula can produce some truly outstanding and uplifting tracks-- ""Emerald City"" and ""La Discoteca"" from their debut, ""All the World"" and ""River of Love"" on this album-- but the catch is, you have to already be in an upbeat mood to appreciate the full effect of the music. This is not music of solace and comfort, this is the sound of exalting in triumph and good fortune. It's what you listen to when you know you've got it good, and you want to high-five the universe. From a depressed perspective, it seems hollow and nearly smug, like a person who sees you in a bad state and condescends to tell you, ""Hey guy! Cheer up!"" without addressing or even respecting your reasons to be upset. They mean well, sure, but it can be aggravating. LOVEWORLD is an album overflowing with sweetness and joy, but it is rather short on depth. This is fair enough-- U.S.E. are a party band, and this is bright, shiny, wholesome party music. The lyrics are mostly concerned with flirting, love, and utopian fantasies, and the tone of the music ranges from serotonin-blasting anthems to sleek, vocoder-heavy disco groovers. The songs are unapologetically corny, and for the most part, the band's craft and total commitment to their concept results in earnest pop that skillfully avoids a cringe-inducing vapidity. When they fail to hit that balance, though, the results are painful, as in the gratingly goofy robo-funk of ""Party People"", or the overly syrupy ""Helping Hand"". Though U.S.E. are about as sugary as it gets, the majority of LOVEWORLD is more mellow and gentle than their debut, which rarely let up from its relentless bombast. They've learned to let their songs open up and breathe a bit without sacrificing their tightness or intensity, and that allows for a less exhausting and more varied listening experience. This doesn't keep the music from feeling overbearing if you're not in the appropriate mindset, but it does open up their sound to nuances that were previously just barely suggested. Nevertheless, the group would be wise to ease up on the vocoder and bring the vocals of Amanda Okonek and Carly Nicklaus closer to the center of their compositions, as they add a generous humanity to the music that can be lost when they go too deep into a mechanical, overly pure perkiness that bears little resemblance to the messy clutter of normal emotions. Ultimately, that is the reason why their music can be so difficult to take in a state of stress and misery-- we may want to strive for perfect joy when we're already in a fantastic mood, but their idealized notion of happiness can seem entirely unrealistic if you're even slightly cynical.","U.S.E. finally follow itsÂ debut with another LP of post-Daft Punk house music, twee indie rock, and a sort of ""Sesame Street""-esque funk.

Bright Penny,Plush,by: Jonathan Garrett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63bc0084474cd0c08f1/1:1/w_160/f701f8bd.jpg,2009-09-30 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13497-bright-penny/,Broken Horse,"Moderation is anathema to Liam Hayes. Under the guise of Plush, Hayes has vacillated from ascetic sparseness (relying almost exclusively on piano for his debut More You Becomes You) to brimming excess (for the densely-populated follow-up Fed). The apparent disdain for temperance has served him well artistically, though it has also resulted in numerous financial setbacks and caused lengthy delays between albums. Hayes reportedly racked up a near-hundred-grand debt financing the Steve Albini-engineered Fed; to make matters worse, he was ultimately unable to secure it a domestic release. Not counting 2004's stripped-down version ofÂ Fed, titledÂ Underfed, Hayes has managed to release only three albums in total since his debut single in 1994, only one of which (the debut) received distribution in the States. Hayes' new album, Bright Penny, follows last year's excellent single, ""Take a Chance"", a breezily nostalgic slice of blue-eyed soul. The euphoric lightness of ""Chance"" suggested that Hayes had a dramatic shift in store for album #3. As different as both More You and Fed are, they remain united by Hayes' meticulous approach to songwriting and recording. The seriousness and naked ambition of both clearly mark them as products of Hayes, despite being on opposite ends of the stylistic spectrum. Even More You, which, according to Hayes, had been constructed to sound like it was recorded in a single take, could never be mistaken for effortless. Hayes has indeed lightened up with Bright Penny, making it arguably his most significant departure to date. As if to underscore, Bright Penny is credited to ""Liam Hayes and Plush."" That's apt: As upbeat as Penny is, Hayes still has trouble making a clean break from the past. Many of the songs bear the weight of over-studied arrangements typical of Plush. Hayes' fussy, exacting touch in the studio tended to work with the somber, downbeat tone of his prior albums, lending them the feel of hard-won victories. But the tack routinely clashes with effervescent Bright Penny, making the album's cheeriness sound oddly labored. The album gets off to an auspicious start with the aforementioned ""Take a Chance"", the blaring horns announcing Hayes's sunny disposition in no uncertain terms. Longtime Plush listeners are also likely to notice the smoother vocals, immediately evident from the first track. Suiting the airy, lighter touch of the songs, Hayes' cracked warble now seems more deliberately on pitch. It fits particularly well on stately ballads like ""If I Could"" and ""We Made It"", both of which manage to convey a sunny, albeit measured, optimism without sounding forced. Unfortunately, Hayes is less convincing when playing it loose: ""Look Up, Look Down"" calls for freewheeling barroom stomp, but everything from the backing singers to the shattered-glass sound effect sounds carefully, persistently arranged. Ultimately, so much thorough plotting begins to darken the mood of Bright Penny. Even the more sprightly tracks, ""So Much Music"" and ""White Telescope"" chief among them, are stifled by structure, a sense that their paths are both predestined and predictable. Toward the album's end, on a song entitled ""Getaway"", Hayes arguably concedes the point, imploring for someone, perhaps himself, to ""let me out of the past."" He doesn't exactly break free on Bright Penny, but typical of Hayes, it's not for lack of trying.","Chicago's hard-luck cult artist finally offers his third album, 11 years after debuting with the exquisite, underrated More You Becomes You.

The Spoils,Zola Jesus,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6359d034d5c69bf34a2/1:1/w_160/fdec97c0.jpg,2009-09-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13487-the-spoils/,Sacred Bones,"On their first-full length, Zola Jesus assert the potential of their earlier work, flex a bit more songwriting muscle, and shatter the idea that their style should make them a niche interest or a cult wonder. Their earliest singles, EPs, and CD-Rs were promising, with an immediately identifiable aesthetic and an obvious talent in singer/leader Nika Roza Danilova and her enormous voice. Though there were hints of more melodic directions on her earlier work (see ""Nativity"" from New Amsterdam), they were pulled in a few different directions, between structure and atmosphere, or vulnerable longing and stark, theatrical wailing. Their influences were impeccable, and the music, in nodding to avant-garde and proto-goth forbearers while using back-in-vogue bargain-basement production, sounded both familiar and fresh. But The Spoils is much more than an exercise in reverence. No doubt that this record is a little gauzy-sounding, but it's not just making something sound new by making it sound shittier-- this is a potent mix of layered and otherworldly vocals, muddy electronics, and storefront-church keyboards that congeal until it's hard to pick out where one instrument ends and the other begins. When the tension swells, there's no volume that gets turned up or pedal that's kicked; it just suddenly feels more anxious, often terribly so. The muffled industrial beat of ""Six Feet (From My Baby)"" sounds like someone dragging student desks up the stairs, with watery drones and Danilova's powerful wail. It's familiar ground for the group, until the synths come in at the minute mark with a brief melody, setting up a push-pull dynamic between a familiar swoon and an anchorless anxiety in the verses. Even as the record veers away from songs and structure toward creepier pieces that concentrate on mood and tone, the music never loses its visceral impact. The backward effects and wordless upper registers Danilova explores on ""Sinfonia and the Shrew"" are as compelling as they are disorienting, and the piano from the fragile interlude ""Lullaby in Tongues"" is even pretty, while closing tracks ""In Hiding From the Crow"" and ""Tell It to the Willow"" are as unsettling as intended. But when the album's haunted feeling sneaks in an emotion like yearning, it moves from compelling pastiche to a sucker-punch to the gut. The Spoils is compelling throughout, but the peak comes much later in its runtime, with ""Smirenye"" and especially ""Clay Bodies"". The distorted keys of the former sound like chimes over Danilova's sweetened vocals and the song's dogged mid-tempo beat, and the simple wedding-march piano of ""Clay Bodies"" is overwhelmed by clattering percussion-- though none of it ever distracts from the vocals. Nearly anything Danilova sings sounds like a matter of life or death, especially so on these later tracks; the words are almost beside the point. Yes, some will lose patience for the scrappy bedroom/basement production on display here. But that's no reason to preclude anyone from hearing The Spoils; the intensity of its emotion is real, and given its theatrical roots, it never veers into cartoonish exaggeration or caricature. Danilova exhaustively charts these emotions while creating temples out of stray sonic parts to house them in, creating something distinctive out of sounds often explored and emotions commonly felt.","Their gothy sound is reminiscent of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Cabaret Voltaire, but on their first proper full-length Zola Jesus show a distinctive voice.

All My Friends Are Funeral Singers,Califone,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62f5e6ef95969320c91/1:1/w_160/d123058a.jpg,2009-09-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13491-all-my-friends-are-funeral-singers/,Dead Oceans,"There's no other band like Califone. Ten years ago in this publication, Mark Richardson called them ""the perfect sonic evolution for rock,"" praising their ability to meld the noise prevalent in experimental music with the organic textures of folk as if it were the most natural thing. A decade on, that's still accurate-- Tim Rutili, Ben Massarella, Jim Becker, Joe Adamik, and the various other musicians in Califone's orbit have managed to take their original aesthetic coup and make an incredibly consistent nine-album career out of it. They've been so thoroughly on point on each of their records that earlier this summer, when I happened to be with several fans of the band, no one named the same album as his or her favorite. That kind of catalog, so reliable but lacking that one standout masterpiece, makes a band easy to take for granted, and there's a temptation to see All My Friends Are Funeral Singers as Another Califone Record. This is especially true on the first few listens, as all those familiar broken textures rush toward you and that one song Tim Rutili has figured out a million ways to write plays again and again. But as you learn the landscape of the album, it becomes clear that Another Califone Record really is a high compliment, and that they can continue to ply the same ground with the same success because that ground is so versatile. This album is a companion to a feature-length film of the same title, which the band will present and accompany live during a tour next year. Unlike Califone's previous live soundtrack sessions, though, this one is comprised of composed songs, not spontaneous instrumental improv. I can't say how these songs play into Rutili's screenplay, but they stand quite well on their own-- All My Friends follows Roots and Crowns as a cohesive collection that sounds caught between a future of broken machines and a rural past of manual labor. Califone's never been the type of band to write melodies you can sing along with, and this is no exception-- Rutili's soft and ragged singing is, as ever, another repeated element, interlocking with the rough acoustic guitar playing, scraping violin, junkyard percussion, and scouring electronics to create something hypnotic. ""Giving Away the Bride"" is one of the most radical deconstructions of normal rock production in the band's catalog, eschewing even their normal roughly recorded acoustic guitars for a spaced-out beat and a monster of a distorted electronic bass figure, over which Rutili floats dreamily, intoning like a blues singer from the 1930s who got lost and tripped into the 21st century. The otherworldliness is so well-developed that it's genuinely startling when the piano drops almost four minutes in or the live drums take up the rhythm a minute after that. If the band had hits, this would be among the greatest. The rest of the tracklist is something like the band's discography as a whole-- fascinating but hard to boil down to a favorite. The title track harks back a bit to Roomsound highlight ""Bottles and Bones (Shades and Sympathy)"" with a similarly bright, surging rush, while ""Ape-Like"" is a stomping hoedown flecked with banjo, fiddle, a sprightly organ theme, and, naturally, a bit of droning feedback. And then the band's odd tribute to Spanish filmmaker Luis BuÃ±uel alternates front-porch jams and group singing with an unusually straight instrumental rock section that's undercut by a clicking, spluttering electric guitar solo. It's hard to think of any other band that combines such disparate elements so naturally, but it all fits together here. So yes, All My Friends Are Funeral Singers is just another Califone album, but it's also a reminder of just what a special thing that is. They've carved a place in the rock landscape by discovering a previously ignored way of building a record and perfecting it over time through repetition. In my mind, it puts them in a lineage that includes bands like Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and This Heat, not sonically but artistically. If you're already switched on to them, you have to hear this. If you're not, well, what's keeping you? The debate over which Califone record is their best just got even more complicated.","The remarkably consistent band continues its strong run here, with another album of fine songs that combine earthy instrumentation and artful noise.

Seek Magic,Memory Tapes,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a612ea9e61561daa52b2/1:1/w_160/d9273125.jpg,2009-09-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13451-seek-magic/,Sincerely YoursAcÃ©phaleSomething in Construction,"No one ever wants to admit that summer's totally over, but it's even tougher this year considering how fun it all was-- seems like every other day, an evocatively named band would come about and contribute to this glo-fi/dreambeat/chillwave thing that was perfect for those unbearably humid August nights rife with possibility, imagining an alternate universe where the narcotic of choice in danceclubs were Galaxie 500 and Saint Etienne records. More than a few of these singles came from Philadelphia's Dayve Hawk in the guise of either Memory Cassette, Weird Tapes, or Memory Tapes. To this point, he'd served as something of a microcosm for this sound, which has created intriguingly hazy, wistful but beat-informed one-offs and EPs, but nothing weighty enough to get it past ""something we did that one summer,"" as if it were a road trip or ill-fated romance recalled years later. That was before Seek Magic, a record of achingly gorgeous dance-pop that captures both the joy of nostalgia and the melancholic sense that we're grasping for good times increasingly out of reach. Initially, Seek Magic's power derives from an intensely personalized ability to unlock hidden chambers in our memory banks. The half-submerged guitars that introduce ""Swimming Field"" suggest this is as a soundtrack for a restless evening, but between its F-G chord progression and aqueous thumb-piano and panflute synths, I'm reminded of scorching July days vibing out to Wilco's A Ghost Is Born. Instrumental breaks ""Pink Stones"" and ""Run Out"" recall the unconventional beauty of Apehx Twin's Richard D. James Album. ""Green Knight"" smacks of Police's ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" in its verse and any number of mid-80s light funk with its guitar licks, the sneaker squeak in the instrumental break is one of the most evocative found sounds I've heard in a while. Seek Magic is something of an inhabitable universe that proves there's far more to Hawk's sound than a way with reverb and passing familiarity with dance loops. The rubber-smacks-road beat of ""Bicycle"" would be content to mirror its titular vehicle, but nearly every minute packs some sort of detailed compositional surprise: the widescreen breakthrough where Hawk's androgynous vocals shake lo-fi two minutes in, the bass breakdown that soon rights itself into the second half's backbone, and the choral coda that lays a euphoric vocal sigh over wave-running New Order guitars. By comparison, ""Plain Material"" is streamlined, but not by much-- the way Hawk's voice hits the fuzzed-out guitar chords, you might think this was an unearthed Flaming Lips track, and at first, it sounds like the first time on Seek Magic that he'll adhere to a standard verse-chorus structure. It does, but only after a drum beat cribbed straight from Organized Noize turns in a bridge of teen screams imported from In Ghost Colours' nastier breakdowns. And yet in Seek Magic's centerpieces, you sense a nocturnal unease usually attributed to more spare albums. ""Stop Talking"" could've been content to ride out its gummy bass riff to infinity, but it morphs through so many phases in its seven minutes that the half-time post-rock finale doesn't feel tacked-on. On the following song, ""Graphics"", Hawk offers an unnervingly lonely sentiment-- ""I don't even recognize the sound of your voice, the feel of your touch, you could be alone even though I'm here by your side."" Lyrics are mere suggestions through most of Seek Magic, but Hawk lays out an ""I can't go on, I'll go on"" vibe throughout. One second, he sighs ""this is the last time"" and immediately thereafter, ""one more time, baby, one more time."" It's a sentiment that's underpinned great works of art from Daft Punk (""One More Time"" natch), F. Scott Fitzgerald (This Side of Paradise), Kanye West (""Why can't life always be this easy?""), and um, Old Milwaukee-- the times where you think ""it doesn't get any better than this,"" and it's simultaneously the happiest and saddest thing you can say.","Producer Dayve Hawk, who has created dreamy electro soundscapes as Memory Cassette, Weird Tapes, and Memory Tapes, arrives with a striking new album.

Manafon,David Sylvian,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a637b1335d7bf1698d9e/1:1/w_160/e99a3607.jpg,2009-09-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13496-manafon/,Samadhi Sound,"David Sylvian's enjoyed a career common to art-rock-leaning, former English pop stars who've doggedly chased their personal obsessions in lieu of giving their old fanbase what they want, again and again. He's not quite as intractable as, say, old peer Mark Hollis (Talk Talk). For one thing, Sylvian's still releasing records. But from the time Japan ditched the crowd-pleasing glam sheen onward, Sylvian's music has forced his cult to reexamine their ongoing relationship with the master's music every few years. That's not to say each of Sylvian's reinventions has been total, at least on an album-to-album basis. Manafon is of a piece with the music Sylvian has released in the 21st century, especially 2003's small masterpiece, Blemish. Like that quiet, achingly personal record, Manafon reaffirms Sylvian's aughts-forged connections with the modern avant-garde, be it jazz, electro-acoustic improvisation, post-glitch electronica, modern composition, or the artists who manage to occupy all four worlds while claiming none of them. A small army of The Wire-friendly types contribute-- sax colossus Evan Parker; Japanese ""onkyo"" ascetics Sachiko M. and Toshimaru Nakamura; guitar re-inventors on the level (and varying praxis) of Keith Rowe, Christian Fennesz, and members of Polwechsel; and many more. So this may be overstating the obvious, but pop music it ain't. Even the unearthly minimalism of Japan's ""Ghosts"" or Blemish's ""Late Night Shopping"" are more immediate than anything on Manafon. If the results aren't as bracingly sour as Sylvian's cross-purpose collaborations with Derek Bailey, they also lack the warmth he gleaned from Fennesz's heat-prickly electronics. His collaborators' small, brittle, seemingly disconnected instrumental gestures slip around the unctuousness of Sylvian's infamously mannered high-romantic vocals. Sylvian's remains a voice whose only peer for unrestrained melodrama is Antony Hegarty, and whose old-school voluptuousness makes Antony's whinnying jazz-isms seem positively astringent. Sylvian's voice doesn't lend itself to the kind of modern scat one associates with ""free"" singing, nor does he even try. But what drama this musical/vocal combination, oil and water on paper, creates on disc. Sylvian often sounds as if he's reading verse rather than singing songs. Choruses are scant, or so languidly paced (as on ""The Greatest Living Englishman"") that they barely register as such. He lets you know just how carefully he's wrought his words, each line left to vibrate with portent before he'll move onto onto the next. Never have the words ""don't know his right foot from his left"" seemed so flush with private meaning. At its best, it's shiver-inducing, a sort of inverse of Joanna Newsom's ecstatic prolixity, though with the same deliberate pacing that can alienate listeners used to songs that progress from verse to verse at the usual clip. Sylvian can rival Michael Gira when it comes to taking his own sweet time getting through a lyric. And at least Swans had brutal, repetitive rhythms to help guide listeners along. Sylvian makes no such concessions to rock tradition, however perverted. And it's the music that makes Manafon a marvel, a mixture of free-improvisation's moment-to-moment sonic epiphanies with Sylvian's molasses-slow kinda-sorta torch songs. Mark Hollis' 1998 solo album is probably the closest comparison to the backing tracks of Manafon. On that underheard record, Hollis asked why couldn't a singer-songwriter album move to the staggered (and staggering) quietude of Morton Feldman's china-fragile chamber music. Sylvian takes it much further out, though. For one thing, while he knows restraint when necessary, you could never describe Sylvian's performance as ""hushed,"" whereas Hollis often seemed to evaporate from his own compositions. Sylvian is front-and-center on every song, which is good because he provides the only rhythmic and melodic stability, as the instrumentals dart and scratch and feedback around him, whether it's the scouring burst of formless guitar noise that opens miniature ""125 Spheres"", the random notes pricking the drone of ""Snow White in Appalachia"", or the splinters of Bernard Herrmann-meets-AMM piano on ""Random Acts of Senseless Violence"". Nothing makes ""sense"" by usual capital-s Songwriting standards; it's music with the rhythm and textural illogic of precipitation. And no other singer is making music this bravely untethered to tradition. Though you know he'll some day move on, you want Sylvian to explore this eerie, expectation-subverting world forever.","Former Japan leader strengthens hisÂ ties to modern avant-garde, be it jazz, electro-acoustic improvisation, post-glitch electronics, or modern composition.

Sing Along to Songs You Don't Know,MÃºm,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6425e6ef95969320cc1/1:1/w_160/6e9fe681.jpg,2009-09-29 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13470-sing-along-to-songs-you-dont-know/,Morr,"MÃºm's fifth album starts off kind of like Tim Hardin's 1966 hit for Bobby Darin, ""If I Were a Carpenter"". Except instead of imagining themselves as Joe the Woodworker (and you as a lady), the Icelandic collective are singing about-- well, the title's ""If I Were a Fish"". It'd almost definitely be making a geyser out of a lyrical plankton-fart to observe that the world's most famous carpenter also happened to be the world's most famous recruiter of fishermen. Shit, just a few lines later, MÃºm are a bumblebee, drowning in ""your soggy eyeballs,"" which, hmm. But uhh, few bands outside 1980s bedsit-indie circles would be better suited to rep the Beatitudes' ""blessed are the meek"" rap than MÃºm. That's as true as ever on Sing Along to Songs You Don't Know. Already one transitional LP (2007's Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy) removed from singer KristÃ­n Anna ValtÃ½sdÃ³ttir's departure to go make backwards recordings with Avey Tare, MÃºm remain pretty obsessed with the kind of childlike innocence that drove people nuts about ValtÃ½sdÃ³ttir's impish persona, let alone her voice. Artists like Japan's Lullatone and Tenniscoats have used similar naÃ¯ve-folk ramshackle wispiness toward their own ambitious, endearing ends, tickling and prodding cuteness toward its avant-garde extremes. MÃºm's latest can be childish, but it isn't cute, and despite some (relatively) inventive arrangements, this time it's a bit of a slog on a purely musical level. Sing Along to Songs You Don't Know still melds electronic and organic elements, as the band have been doing since their early-millennium breakthrough, cramming in male-female harmonies, lo-fi percussion, rhapsodically blue strings, prepared piano, hammered dulcimer, marimbas, ukuleles, and even a parakeet alongside guitars and synths. Billed as a response to the recent unrest in MÃºm's native country, it's an entirely peaceful, largely melancholy, and clearly well-meaning record. Unfortunately, it's also filled with bewildering decision after bewildering decision. With arguably one exception, the most enjoyable aspect of the album is MÃºm's ongoing apprecation for sonic detail, though that can get tiresome fast when such details are attached to cringeworthy songs. You might hear a music box being wound up, or an acoustic guitar string buzzing imperfectly, or what seems to be a didgeridoo. ""The Smell of Today Is Sweet Like the Breastmilk in the Wind"" uses not only chintzy electronics and vaguely disco-punk percussion, but also sloping strings, guitars with the trebly chime of the Afropop-influenced stuff that has been popular lately, and, oh yeah, Belle and Sebastian-style harmonies that become a liability when most of those instruments drop out-- no Stuart Murdoch literary mien here. Busy hi-hats and rough-hewn handclaps give ""Kay-Ray-KÃº-KÃº-KÃ³-Kex"" a retro-soul tone... if the Residents were a retro-soul band. The previously mentioned exception is ""HÃºllabbalabbalÃºÃº"". It's the poppiest song on the album-- not because it mimics existing styles or flashes fashionable r&b influences, but because it brings together plenty of MÃºm's eccentricities in the service of a triumphant feeling. It helps that the singers get to chant syllables that sound like nonsense to American ears, adding, perhaps tellingly: ""In these words we drown."" In any event, the song has some of the album's most successful vocals, horn fanfares, and a structure that ebbs and flows. Two minor problems: The songs are generally slow, samey, and sleep-inducing, and the lyrics, any language differences notwithstanding, are hard to take seriously, even for a guy who raved about I'm From Barcelona. ""If you must cry with grief/ Blow your nose right on my sleeve,"" elfin voices urge on ""Blow Your Nose"", backed only by slow-motion strings and marimba. ""A River Don't Stop to Breathe"" has lovely string and percussion parts, with a poignantly rising refrain, but it's a dragging, preachy song overall, less than the sum. Tranquil finale ""Ladies of the New Century"" spreads out its plodding piano plinks as far as they can go, but offers little to retain all but the most devoted fans' attention between them. It's probably another one of those coincidences, but Pitchfork's Mark Richardson once heard echoes of ""Heart and Soul"" in a MÃºm song, adding, ""I'm not suggesting they stole the melody-- I doubt the band has even heard it."" In addition to the ""If I Were a Carpenter"" similarity, there's a line on quasi-title track ""Sing Along"" that recalls ""You Are My Sunshine"", in melody and lyrics: ""You'll never know,"" MÃºm sing, and I want them to add, ""...dear"", you know? It's enough to make me half-wonder if the album has more of these little references, like a band singing along to songs they don't know-- kind of like the Dirty Projectors' Rise Above, only with half-remembered tunes from childhood instead of a Black Flag album. ""You are so beautiful to us,"" MÃºm sing more than once, coming on a little strong. ""We want to keep you as our pets."" Ha?","Icelandic band remainsÂ pretty obsessed with the kind of childlike innocence that attracts or repels people with equal fervor.

I Am the Cosmos [Deluxe Edition],Chris Bell,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64913d197565213914f/1:1/w_160/6002b761.jpg,2009-09-29 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13498-i-am-the-cosmos-deluxe-edition/,RhinoRhino,"History is written by the winners, but in the case of Big Star it's the losers-- the quiet obsessives, the hopeless romantics ""in love with that song"" (to quote Paul Westerberg)-- who kept the band's legacy alive under the threat of perpetual obscurity. Certainly Big Star itself (current iteration aside) didn't really last long enough to bask in any belated good will. Alex Chilton's writing partner Chris Bell was gone by the time the band released its second album, 1974's Radio City, and by the next year Chilton had essentially pulled the plug on the group, leaving behind a few loose ends later collected as the once-abandoned, later-resuscitated masterpiece Third/Sister Lovers. Bell died in a car accident not long after that album's eventual 1978 release. Prone to serious depression and chemical indulgence, he began fitfully working on solo material as soon as he exited Big Star (though he reportedly participated in at least some of the Radio City sessions), and if there was every reason to expect good things from him, Big Star's own bad luck was indication enough he'd have just as much trouble getting people to hear it. In fact, it wasn't until Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers showed up on shelves (however haphazardly) that Bell made his solo bow: the single ""I Am the Cosmos"" backed with ""You and Your Sister"", songs coincidentally (or not) steeped in the same sense of sadness and loss that marked Big Star's swan song. That's all most heard of Bell's solo work until 1992, when Rykodisc compiled his extant studio material on I Am the Cosmos, which fittingly showed up alongside a spiffy definitive reissue of the scattershot Third/Sister Lovers and followed some renewed interest in Bell's writing (This Mortal Coil covered both ""I Am the Cosmos"" and ""You and Your Sister"" on 1991's Blood, the latter song sung by then-Breeders Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly). It turned out that Bell, between demo sessions, working in his parents' restaurant, gigging around Europe with various pick-up bands, and dealing with his ongoing depression, had amassed more than enough strong material to make him a cult hero, almost akin to an American analog of Nick Drake, another struggling songwriter lost too soon but unearthed and embraced later (thanks, in no small part, to his own reissues). Granted, Bell never got his Volkswagen moment, and admittedly he remains on the cultier end of the cult act spectrum. Case in point: while Big Star gets its own four-disc Rhino boxed set, an expanded reissue of Bell's I Am the Cosmos gets relegated to Rhino's Handmade imprint. It's there for people to buy it, but only if they know where to look first. In some ways it's almost fitting that, finally given his moment in the spotlight, he's stationed just left of the bright beam, still illuminated but not totally out of the shadows, either. But seeing as the original CD issue of I Am the Cosmos was, by necessity, cobbled together from Bell's remains, what, exactly, was left in the vaults? The new reissue features the original album (as such) on the first disc, 12 songs presented in a slightly re-sequenced order. To call most of these songs ""down"" would be as unjustly reductive as calling Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers ""depressing."" It may be true on one level, but it fails to get at the soulful essence that makes Bell so special. Back in Big Star, Chilton and Bell shared a ""Chilton/Bell"" writing credit, but that was as illusory as ""Lennon/McCartney."" Away from Big Star, Bell's solo work proves him Chilton's equal, or at least equally inclined toward a sort of melancholy but melodic proto power-pop (the ""pop"" part echoing the Beatles, of course, but with the emphasis on ""power,"" at least in terms of the emotions it contains and evokes). Here, ""Better Save Yourself"" hangs heavy and haggard, and Bell's vocals on ""Look Up"" are downright heartbreaking, giving songs such as it, ""Though I Know She Lies"" and ""There Was a Light"" the same sense of shaky, tragic inevitability that pervades Third/Sister Lovers. ""Speed of Sound"", ""Get Away"", ""I Got Kinda Lost"", and ""Make a Scene"" surely could have found a place in Big Star's oeuvre, too, given their due in the studio. The second disc is where the barrel scraping begins, but to the set's credit, much of what's included-- 15 tracks, all but two previously unreleased-- actually helps expand the history of Bell and Big Star. Yes, the bulk comprises alternate versions and mixes (including a version of ""Get Away"" featuring Chilton on guitar), but as with the rarities on Big Star's box, the different perspective proves an invaluable annex to the band's limited catalog (just as fleeting captures of Bell's slow, Southern drawl of a speaking voice proves a fascinating contrast to his sharp, British Invasion-inflected singing voice). Fleshing out the still oddly incomplete Big Star portrait are a few tracks from Bell's pre-Big Star bands Icewater and Rock City (whose early version of ""My Life Is Right"", essentially the same as Big Star's version, underscores Bell's talents), subsequent collaborations with Memphis scene fixtures Keith Sykes and Nancy Byran, and a sleepy solo instrumental, ""Clacton Rag"". ""There were cool things all over Chris' tapes,"" said Ardent Studios engineer Adam Hill recently in the Memphis Flyer, referring to ""Clacton Rag"". ""I found one thing they weren't initially gonna put on the Cosmos reissue, this acoustic guitar demo that theoretically could've been cut anytime, although I think it dates to the mid- or late-70s. No vocals, just pure Chris."" Considering that Bell's tragically limited life and output precludes a fuller portrait, this edition of I Am the Cosmos comes closest to capturing ""just pure Chris"" as we're likely ever going to get.","This set from Rhino Handmade augments the former Big Star member's posthumous collection of solo material with an extra disc of alternate versions and mixes.

The Sound the Speed the Light,Mission of Burma,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63213d197565213911b/1:1/w_160/d53eb53a.jpg,2009-09-29 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13489-the-sound-the-speed-the-light/,Matador,"In their first go-round in the early 1980s, Mission of Burma were equal parts innovation and perspiration. Their muscular post-punk was groundbreaking, but it also had a workman-like quality. Maybe that's what made them unique-- Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott always had their noses to the grindstone even when they were being visionary. Since reforming in 2002, Burma haven't been nearly as pioneering. But their hard-toiling side has not only persisted, it has expanded to fill in the gap. Of their three post-reunion albums so far, The Sound the Speed the Light sounds the most industrious, the most like another day at the office. There's nothing surprising here, and some songs are so signature-styled you might wonder if you've heard them before. But when it comes to office work, Burma's day beats most bands' years. So the lack of surprise also means a lack of flaws, and a lot of energy and power. When these guys punch the clock, they take the phrase literally. So yet another Burma album hits the ground running, this time with ""1,2,3 Partyy!"", a seriously fun song about how funny it is that someone would take partying seriously. That energy spills into ""Possession"", which swings between weight-lifting pound and a wistful chorus, with lots of Miller guitar grit in between. Later, Conley's bass melodies and half-spoken lyrics turn ""Forget Yourself"" into a thoughtful semi-ballad. By time the anthemic ""SSL 83"" carries the record to its halfway point, it's been six straight unimpeachable tunes, forming an album side that rivals any Burma album side. It would've been easy to let The Sound cruise from there, filling it with solid also-rans. But the energy level and commitment continue unabated. Two songs in particular stand out. ""So Fuck It"", with its raucous beat and Miller guitar pyrotechnics, captures the band's mix of introspection and machismo perfectly: ""I often wonder what I'm worth/ But I won't take shit from you or anyone else/ So fuck it!"" Closer ""Slow Faucet"" combines Burma's trademark crescendos with stretches of slow-burning guitar, evoking Sonic Youth's more meditative moments. The fact that Burma seems physically unable to take so much as a note off is inspiring, but also a little depressing-- imagine all the great music we must have missed during their two-decade hiatus, because they surely would've worked hard at making it. But maybe they would've gotten jaded, stale, or just plain tired if they had played the indie rock game for 20 years. Either way, seven years into their second life, Mission of Burma keep attacking their music like they're lucky to be playing it for everyone again. Given all the hard work that went into The Sound the Speed the Light, the converse is even more true.","The most industrious of their three post-reunion albums, The Sound's songs are soÂ signature-styled you might wonder if you've heard them before.

45:33 Remixes,LCD Soundsystem,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6479d034d5c69bf34ca/1:1/w_160/9f5ae292.jpg,2009-09-29 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13502-4533-remixes/,DFA,"What a bizarrely tardy project, this remix comp. The original 45:33, James Murphy's contribution to Nike's intermittent series of one-artist mixes designed for exercise, is edging up on being three years old. In Internet-era time, the DFA might as well have let these producers loose on original Giorgio Moroder demos. Not that 45:33 itself sounds dated, already owing so much to classic disco and techno. Like all LCD releases, 45:33 was Murphy acting as curator of his local dance music historical society, while thrillingly (at its best) filtering it through his own mix of mordancy and guarded euphoria. Lest we forget, it contained an embryonic version of LCD's ""Someone Great"", sans vocals, making it more or less the debut of Murphy's more tender side, something that bloomed gorgeously on the following year's Sound of Silver. But remix comps are generally rush-to-market affairs crassly designed to capitalize on a hot release by extending its commercial value for a few more months. The presumably long gestation time of 45:33 Remixes might make you think we're getting something really special, something that took time to get just right.Â In reality, not so much. 45:33 Remixes is more-or-less superfluous, the depressingly common fate of the bulk of remix comps. Of the eight remixers, no less than five fix on the exact same section of the original 45:33, which starts around 18 minutes in and dissolves into brass gurgles 10 minutes later. Given that the remixers had 45 minutes worth of music to rebuild from the ground up, leaning on the most traditionally ""disco"" section of 45:33, complete with horns and diva, and leaving it mostly intact feels like a failure of nerve and/or imagination. Brooklyn duo Runaway add watery keyboard stabs that blow arrhythmically against the main beat, as if they were playing an Arthur Russell demo on top of the original. Akwardly. Prince Language throws on some dub wobble, but you've got to A/B the two versions closely to even gauge what he's added or subtracted, the ""playing with the levels"" school of remixing at its blandest. And Theo Parrish, who you'd assume could at least be relied on to add some soul-funk grit to the proceedings, comes momentarily correct with boogie bass and extra percussion. But for a guy who could squeeze so much emotion out of the minimal materials of the ruthlessly raw, repetitive ""Ugly Edits"" series, Parrish's remix blands out over its seven-plus minutes, despite being 10 times more overstuffed. Hey, another Walter Gibbons-aping breakdown with call-and-response drums reverbed to hell and back. It might not seem so deadeningly familiar if it rivaled Gibbons' own best work. Of the four, only Riley Reinhold does anything remotely interesting with that 10-minute slab of downtown-NYC-in-the-1970s retro. His big innovation is replacing the 4/4 disco swish with a rigid electro-breakbeat shuffle. Even given how generic and/or tentative the other three remixes sound, you can't exactly call Reinhold's remix revelatory. That leaves four remixers to try and make up for the creativity deficit. And they're good, though not one wows enough to obviate the cost of the whole collection. Prins Thomas takes the original's most feathery section, the cascade of Tangerine Dream-ish synths and wordless vocals that make up the long outro, and turns in pop ambient by adding a micro-syncopated pulse. Trus'Me's electro is the set's most playful and unexpected track, especially when it closes with twinkling mallets that could be kissing cousin to the kind you used to get on Tortoise or Nobukazu Takemura records. Padded Cell's the only remixer who thought, ""Hey, maybe I can patch different sections of the original together to make something that extends the vibe, rather than adding congas and calling it a day."" (A seriously missed opportunity on everyone else's part.) He takes the outro coos that also beguiled Thomas and adds the lugubrious piano house that serves as the original's warmup. And surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly together, each adding to the other's preexisting sad dreaminess for the best remix here. What 45:33 Remixes lacks most is personality, something even LCD's experimental one-offs (like the original 45:33) reliably offer. See: Pilooski's deep house pastiche. Yes, it sounds nothing like the original. It just sounds like... a deep house pastiche. It's not just that the remixes dilute Murphy's inimitable presence in his own music; 45:33 was mostly vocal-free to begin with. It's that the remixers don't add much of themselves to compensate, preferring to subtly tweak sections of the original to make them more dancefloor friendly or shove them through familiar schtick. That's the charitable view, at least. A sadder take might be that the artists were just cashing a much-needed check, whether it was cut three weeks or three years after 45:33 hit iTunes. Or worse, they blanched at the freedom to dismantle Murphy's creation to satisfy their own idiosyncratic wants, their hesitancy all the more strange considering that LCD's whole M.O., what makes the band more than a sterile realization of the gag at the heart of ""Losing My Edge"", is Murphy's willingness to bend or break history to make room for himself.","James Murphy's contribution to Nike's intermittent series of one-artist mixes designed for exercise gets a belated remix treatment.

Even so, if you read/live on the Internet, too, chances are you've noticed a deluge of dudes taking aim at bringing beach times to your headphones year round. Just by name alone: Wavves brought us bummers, Surfer Blood are sharing huge uppers, and the Underwater Peoples label in D.C. as a whole specializes almost exclusively in Coppertoned escapism/aesthetics. Holiday Shores (formerly Continental Divide) are a Tallahassee five-piece that re-named their band after the Florida street on which lead vocalist Nathan Pemberton grew up. Florida underlined. Pushing off with a short stretch of vocal harmonizing that somehow echoes Fleet Foxes, opener ""Reruns"" actually takes on shades of early Shins songs, another Phil Ek-assisted band. Those hooks were spit-polished and very much in tune to the weird bubbles James Mercer zipped them up in. The same kind of relationship between sonics, structure, and environment can be found here. Though Columbus'd the Whim avoids many of the lo-fi-isms that have stamped so many of said summer jams this year, it does share a similar, shoes-untied vibe. That's inherent in the guitar tones (chiming!) and pacing (fluid!) and effects (koozies of reverb and delay!) more than any insistence on the immediacy some associate with garage sloppiness. It's not music for the beach, it's music of the beach. Take ""Phones Don't Feud"", which lolls along before cutting itself in half with a crash of frothy tremolo, Pemberton surfing the subsequent swirl of trebly guitar and ""oooh-aaah"" vocal layering as it decrescendos and eventually dissolves away. It's a beautiful way to build a song. But rarely are Holiday Shores so direct in their approach. As much as Pemberton's vocals sit front row, the reliance on wavy-gravy effects obscures the melodic connections-- so many times this sounds like a band playing from a few blocks away. Most of that problem can be heard in the guitars and the way they chase their tails at times. Listen closely enough to ""Edge of Our Lives"" and ""Errand of Tongue"", and you can totally pick up on jazzy, night time strains of the Clientele or even Parachutes-era Coldplay. Before taking a stab at some West African guitar calisthenics, ""Bradley Bear"" opens with some of the sort of delay-heavy, sopping wet guitar drips that leave you with water in your ears. Those sounds in particular humidify most of the record, but when crammed and sandwiched in between so many ideas (see also: ""Tremor Rolls the Peak"") it makes for a soggy mess at times. It's why the tunefulness and drive help ""Experiencer"" stand out as much as it does: all the melody you could ask for, but none of the pruning.","With a name like Holiday Shores, you'd guess this Florida group is part of 2009's fuzzed-out, beach-party vibe. You'd be right.

Fool's Gold,Fool's Gold,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62cea9e61561daa52f1/1:1/w_160/e506e149.jpg,2009-09-28 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13494-fools-gold/,IAMSOUND,"The furious and unfortunate dissection of authenticity that came part and parcel with the rise of Vampire Weekend made for good copy-- for all of two weeks. It quickly became a groaner. But it persists as that band's profile grows. And so now any band that follows and is sufficiently infused with Afropop influence-- sunny guitar, rattles, djembe, etc.-- carries the burden of comparison, derision, and, for shame, trend-humping. Fool's Gold probably aren't thrilled about this. Guitarist and songwriter Lewis Pesacov has been quietly filtering his obsession with African music into the songs of his other band, sun-smacked L.A. rockers Foreign Born, for two solid, underrated albums. Foreign Born's ""Early Warnings"" is the apex of that subtle evolution, and the highlight of this year's Person to Person. With Fool's Gold, a side project that could emerge as the more viable of the two bands, Pesacov, with Israel-born singer/songwriter Luke Top (and a rotating cast from bands like We Are Scientists, Glasser, the Fall, and Foreign Born), gives himself over entirely to his muse. The sounds of Touareg and Afrobeat and Ghanaian Highlife are rippling through the eight songs here, each a rollicking, warm reflection of appreciation. Pesacov has eradicated questions about authenticity by composing gorgeous odes to forbearers like Ali and Vieux Farka TourÃ©, Tinariwen, and Konono NÂ°1. There is a catch that makes this something less than out and out replication. Opener ""Surprise Hotel""-- all pinging guitar lines and hand-slapped drums-- sounds like the kind of thing filmmaker Jonathan Demme would drop onto one of his ""world-conscious,"" rubbernecking soundtracks. And then Luke Top begins to sing. At first it feels like a tribal chant. Which, of course it is. Only not the tribe you're thinking of. Top, a full-throated, melismatic vocalist, sings nearly every song in Hebrew. There is something initially shtick-y about this-- watch as cultures collide! But there is also something natural about the tones, the ohhs and ahhs, and the swaying force of each lyric that Top offers. There's an added value to much of the lyrical obfuscation, too: Top isn't much of a lyricist. That his words are hidden behind what will be largely indecipherable to most listeners is a plus. The lyrics to each song are printed in English in the liners of Fool's Gold, and they reveal a pretentious streak. From the half-sung in English ""Momentary Shelter"": ""A mind of night is mine/ A frozen light imbibes/ The darkness is boiling/ Your skin in the moonlight."" Still, this is ultimately Pesacov's show. The two transcendent moments of this album come in succession: The first is the yearning ""Nadine"", a brass band raveup that is equal parts celebratory and mournful; the second is the expansive ""Ha Dvash"", which plays like a narcotized recreation of Talking Heads' experiments in familiar territory on Remain in Light. Top isn't frantic like David Byrne, and so while the song is less an advance on the sound, it's a fusion that, in some ways, fits better. And so maybe Fool's Gold can dodge some cultural reduction along the way.","Foreign Born'sÂ Lewis Pesacov has been filtering African music into his songs for ages, but his new project will still attract Vampire Weekend comparisons.

Where Were You When It Happened?,Monotonix,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6319d034d5c69bf3499/1:1/w_160/818c6c6e.jpg,2009-09-28 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13490-where-were-you-when-it-happened/,Drag City,"The standard take on Israeli trio Monotonix is that their insane live act is such a spectacle that the music doesn't matter. To a large extent it's true-- the band definitely prioritizes antics over songs, happy to let their tunes fall apart completely if it means singer Ami Shalev can jump off a balcony or drummer Ran Shimoni can ""play"" his kit on top of the audience. There's so much to watch at their gigs that once the dust settles, it's hard to remember what you heard. So seeking out Montonix albums after seeing them live is kind of like wanting to know what music was playing at a circus. The funny thing is, if you think of them more as carnival souvenirs than art, Monotonix's records are actually pretty good. If you only want to hear progressive ideas or original sounds, you probably can live without them. But considering that this is devoutly derivative garage rock, there's more going on in these tunes than you might imagine. And, most surprisingly, the band's sound has already evolved in the span of just two releases. Their debut Drag City EP, 2008's Body Language, mined classic hard-rock and metal, often heading directly for Black Sabbath territory. Where Were You When It Happened?-- deemed an LP even though it's only five minutes longer-- is grittier and grimier, lying somewhere along the crayoned line that connects the pre-punk blues damage of the Stooges to the scummy grunge of Mudhoney. Where Shalev previously preferred an Ozzy moan, here he has more of an Iggy howl, and it dovetails nicely with guitarist Yonatan Gat's crunchier tone. There's even a moment during the album's best track, ""Set Me Free"", where the pair unite in a vocal-and-feedback whine that's as mesmerizing as anything the band does onstage. Outside of that highlight, the album gets by primarily on sped-up energy. Tunes like the riff-riot ""Flesh and Blood"", the swinging ""I Can't Take It Anymore"", and the rolling Mudhoney-rip ""Spit It on Your Face"" all sound a little faster, a little tighter, a little more manic than they rightfully should. Even the more down-tempo ""Something Has Dried"" has a tautness akin to the Jesus Lizard's forays into slow slobber. The band does eventually run out of steam, ending with two weak attempts to add variety and texture through forced crescendos and meditative duets. But aside from those experiments, Where Were You has one crucial thing in common with the Monotonix stage act: it's a lot of fun. Again, there's nothing genuinely new here, and the influences are so obvious I would bet that even someone who hasn't heard music like this before could quickly smell the band's debt to its predecessors. But just as you'd have to be made of stone not to enjoy at least some part of a Monotonix gig, anyone who likes garage rock would have to be an obstinate stickler for originality not to enjoy the best parts-- that is, the majority-- of Where Were You When It Happened?","Grittier than Drag City debutÂ Body Language, the latest from this Israeli band connects the Stooges' pre-punk blues to Mudhoney's grunge.

Vapours,Islands,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6385e6ef95969320ca8/1:1/w_160/44cb0cf5.jpg,2009-09-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13485-vapours/,Anti-,"When Jamie Thompson and Nick Diamonds started their second post-Unicorns collaboration-- the first was Th' Corn Gangg, remember?-- it made perfect sense that they should call it Islands. With breezy calypso rhythms, honeyed country-acoustic guitars, bubbly/silly synthesizer effects, and summery melodies, their debut, Return to the Sea, was a wonderful getaway soundtrack, obscuring its death-haunted lyrics with bright arrangements and rich, coconut-scented production. On Islands' second album, however, storm clouds descended: Arm's Way found the band down a member-- Thompson amicably departed before its recording-- yet ballooned into a six-piece, and the bloat was audible. Melodies (previously the shivery highlight of their songs) were buried in meandering guitar solos, baroque, melodramatic strings, and gloomy, silvery keyboards for a dark, proggy effect that bled the band of much of its fun and levity. The good news is that the clouds seem to have parted; on their third album, Islands are sunny once more. Perhaps it's due to the return of Thompson, back in the fold after his one-album hiatus, or just a product of stripping the instrumentation down to its most basic structure (in many cases, just synths, drums, and guitar) in service of memorable tunes, but Islands have made a welcome return to form. While those hoping for Return to the Sea's Afro-Caribbean flourishes and guest rappers will be disappointed, Vapours' comparably spare synth-pop is replete with the juicy hooks and major-key bounce that were so lacking from their last effort. The album kicks off with ""Switched On""'s repetitive shimmying guitar figure, squishy 1980s synths, and swooning, hiccuping vocals. The title track struts like a peacock, showing off a big, swaggering chorus (""It's the bassline in your mind/ It's a sexy way to cry/ You know I've had my share of doubt/ Until I saw the vapours in your eyes"") over a four-on-the-floor stomp and brassy, confident horns. And ""Tender Torture"" is not only the most lyrically literal interpretation of Islands' earlier beachy ethos but also, with its whirring suction-cup synth effects and gooey ""ooohs,"" the apex of their futuristically sweet sound.Â That's not to say Islands have given up their penchant for darkness-- after all, we're talking about guys whose main lyrical concerns have long been bones and ghosts. Moody numbers-- like ""No You Don't"" with its spare percolating keyboards and lyrics that warn, ""Don't buy dope from a man you don't know""-- still abound. But built as they are on tightly wound mechanical beats and free of rococo arrangements, these murkier moments feel more visceral for their restraint. What made Islands' debut so thrilling (and saved Arm's Way from its grandiose ambitions) was the expansive, creative way they wrapped up their classic pop hooks in unexpected instrumentation or imaginative production. And Vapours, though more stripped down than either of its predecessors, continues in that tradition. Surely, many criticisms of the album will include a mention of Islands' Auto-Tuned ""Heartbeat"", but with organic, galloping guitars and whimsical synth flourishes underscoring their most vulnerable vocal melody, Diamonds' mechanized voice adds a dash of synthetic style and keeps things from devolving into the realm of the overly sentimental. Though there is an overall whiff of the 1980s about Vapours, it sidesteps the traps of either sounding trendily vintage or indistinguishable from the rest of today's Reagan-era impostors. It works best, however, to think of the album as a return to Return to the Sea, only, as its title suggests, in a hazier, less opaque form. It's as if that album's liquid-y tracks have evaporated, leaving only wispy traces of synthesizer melodies and quirky pop choruses wafting through the air.","After the relative darkness of Arm's Way, Islands welcomes back original member Jamie Thompson and makes a welcome return to the sound of their debut.

The Sun Came Out,7 Worlds Collide,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65713d1975652139171/1:1/w_160/8dab303d.jpg,2009-09-28 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13512-the-sun-came-out/,Columbia,"The Sun Came Out, the second release by the nebulous entity called 7 Worlds Collide, is the musical equivalent of vacation snapshots. Crowded House resident Neil Finn invited a supergroup's worth of artists from the UK and America to convene over the Christmas holidays at his New Zealand studio and record an album for charity. Members of Wilco and Radiohead made the trip, along with KT Tunstall, Lisa Germano, Johnny Marr, and a handful of Australian and New Zealand artists. They had three weeks to complete as much as possible, and while that may seem like a long sojourn, it's a fast turn-around when there are 20 musicians coming in and out, some of them bringing finished songs to record but most of them writing as they go. Finn, however, kept it low-key by promising proceeds to Oxfam and by inviting the artists'Â families along. He even included his own musical brood: his wife Sharon, sons Liam and Elroy, and brother Tim all played on the album. Even Spencer Tweedy, Jeff's teenage son, gets a credit. This isn't the first time Neil Finn has played cruise director. In 2001, he assembled some of the same personnel for a series of concerts and a live double album benefiting Doctors Without Borders. Eight years later, he's grown even more ambitious, and what might have been a slapdash studio effort instead comes across as polished, professional, and cohesive. Of course, like almost every double album, The Sun Came Out would work better at half the length, weeding out the meandering instrumental ""3 Worlds Collide"" along with some of the less effective folk-pop iterations, such as ""Duxton Blues"" by Augie March singer Glenn Richards and Bic Runga's ""Change of Heart"". Jeff Tweedy's ""You Never Know"" was re-recorded for Wilco (The Album), and this version forgoes the George Harrison guitar fireworks but retains the Sly Stone ooh-sha-sha rhythms, losing some of its rock-historical humor and authority in the process. His other contribution, ""What Could Have Been"", fits better on this album, with his measured vocal and Finn's sensitive guitarwork. The album features several unlikely singers, including Wilco's John Stirratt and Pat Sansone and former Soul Coughing bass player Sebastian Steinberg, but the real headline so far seems to be, PHIL SELWAY SINGS... AND HE'S NOT HALF BAD. The Radiohead drummer wrote two numbers: the gentle ""Ties That Bind"" and the subdued sing-along ""Witching Hour"", both of which show off his ear for subtle melodic hooks and his arcing, textured voice. He outdoes some of the more professional singers, including the Mutton Birds' Don McGlashan, who at his best sounds like an indie-rock Mike Scott but doesn't have especially good songs to sing. On the recommendation of Glenn Kotche, Finn invited KT Tunstall down to Auckland as well, and she turns out to be one of the project's most spirited participants. While she's often dismissed as a bland pop-Americana artist from the Michelle Branch school, her Scottish cowgirl vocals and easy way with a chorus enliven her upbeat ""Hazel Branch"" and her downbeat ""Black Silk Ribbon"", a duet with New Zealand singer-songwriter Bic Runga. Sharon Finn proves a playful foil for her husband on the duet ""Little by Little"", and Lisa Germano almost steals the album by leading everyone through a sing-along on the stand-out ""Reptile"". Even though she plays violin on several tracks here, she still seems underutilized. The Sun Came Out, whether intentionally or not, is an album for singers, but often it's the music that elevates the songs and prevents even the slickest moments from falling into the AOR mire. Kotche and Steinberg form a solid rhythm section on numerous tracks, while pretty much anyone who's not singing lead is singing back-up that ranges from the full choir of ""Reptile"" to the strange whispers on ""The Ties That Bind"". Ed O'Brien conjures Marc Bolan on the opening glam chords of ""Bodhisattva Blues"", sharing vocals with Finn, and Tweedy adds a jostling guitar solo to Finn's ""All Comedians Suffer"". More than even the surprising vocal turns, that sense of give-and-take between the musicians makes The Sun Came Out more than just a collection of cast-offs for charity. It could be a real band here, albeit one that needs an editor.","Crowded House's Neil Finn leads a number of artists-- members of Radiohead and Wilco, Johnny Marr, and Lisa Germano-- on this ambitious 2xCD project.

White Clouds Drift On and On,Brock Van Wey,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64b13d1975652139156/1:1/w_160/783d3b32.jpg,2009-09-25 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13499-white-clouds-drift-on-and-on/,Echospace,"As Bvdub, Brock Van Wey pokes holes in the fabric between dub and ambient music. On his first release under his own name, White Clouds Drift On and On, he discards drums and bass entirely, producing his finest work yet in the process. The tracks are built from tapered, drenching loops of tone, massed in respiring pulses. The music beats, shivers, yawns open. The album's title, while almost comically generic, is apt: without drums, it's wonderfully unimpeded, like a huge pendulum slowly spending its energy. We would get that it's Van Wey's most personal work even if it weren't for song titles like ""I Knew Happiness Once""-- the tracks are sensitively inhabited, with a human ache in every cascade. Though Gas is Van Wey's most obvious forebearer, traces of modern minimal techno and dubstep echo in the distance. You can detect the Field on ""A Gentle Hand to Hold"", where an idyllic guitar loop slaloms lazily through voices as evanescent as soap bubbles, and Burial on ""Too Little Too Late"", with its gauzy clatter, and vocal information about rapture and pain. The album's emotional depth makes itself plain, but it has a conceptual dimension as well: It lies on a continuum of deconstruction. Dub itself is already an abstraction of something else; White Clouds is an abstraction of dub; and the bonus disc-- a series of interpretations by Stephen Hitchell, as Intrusion-- abstracts White Clouds. Hitchell breaks up Van Wey's glaciers into ice chunks floating on vast seas, sometimes gathering them back up with nets of percussion. The second disc also stretches the total play time to upwards of two and a half hours. This amplitude winds up being important. White Clouds is immediately pleasurable for the opulence of its sounds. From the unhurriedly swooping strings of ""Too Little Too Late"" to the tinkling piano in an engulfing corona of drones on ""A Chance to Start Over"", Van Wey cultivates an unremitting sense of majesty and loneliness. But to praise ambient music for prettiness is like praising a house track because you can dance to it. Epic pace and scale are what push White Clouds over the border between pretty and awesome. The deliberate pace screws with your perception of time, and minutes melt away unnoticed. When ""I Knew Happiness Once"" finally begins to swirl around the drain, I'm always astonished that 16 minutes have elapsed. Van Wey lets his parts linger until they feel inert and permanent, only then introducing new elements-- often ecstatic voices, piercing what seemed an impenetrable wall of sound. He uses long forms not to antagonize or subdue, but to unleash a welter of happy-sad feeling. It's the most gracious, forthcoming ambient music I've heard this year.","Typically working with dub and ambient music as Bvdub, here Van Wey ditches drums and bass for a full-on, immersive Gas-inspired experience.

Through the Devil Softly,Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63d5e6ef95969320cb4/1:1/w_160/ec8411dd.jpg,2009-09-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13482-through-the-devil-softly/,Nettwerk,"Listen to the staggering, dusty lope of ""Trouble"", and you might think you'd stumbled upon a lost Mazzy Star track from that band's peak in the mid-1990s. Which makes sense-- Hope Sandoval was the singer for Mazzy Star, and she keeps the aesthetic of that band very much alive in this, her second solo-ish effort since her old band stopped early this decade. Her accomplice in the absence of David Roback is My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm Ã CÃ­osÃ³ig, who essentially is the Warm Inventions, as was the case on their 2001 debut, Bavarian Fruit Bread. Through the Devil Softly is a quietly enveloping listen, and Sandoval's decision not to get too far from the sound of her former band is a wise one. Her husky voice and worn-down delivery are perfectly served by this open, reverb-heavy, and downtrodden background. You get the sense of her wandering through some abandoned, former gold-rush town, singing quietly to herself as the tumbleweeds bounce by. For his part, Ã CÃ­osÃ³ig is about a million miles from the extreme density and close-mic'd immediacy of My Bloody Valentine, and he embraces the change in his languid drumming on the record (he plays other instruments and co-produces with Sandoval as well). The two give themselves a palette of guitar, banjo, and occasional vibes, keyboard, or cello to build Sandoval's landscapes, which are variably interesting. One of the most interesting textures is found on ""For the Rest of Your Life"", which sounds constructed on a loop of an echoing, muted pick slide on the E string of a guitar. Sandoval floats over the top with some vibes and sparse flashes of electric guitar, and as the song fades after the verses it sounds as if it's wandering off into a void. The void is never far away on this record. Even at its warmest, there are ghosts in the air and cobwebs in the corners, as on the single ""Blanchard"", which opens the album with the interplay of a shimmering guitar phrase and distant, wordless vocal. The banjo plucking on ""Fall Aside"" and ""Blue Bird"" is slow and wobbly, and Ã CÃ­osÃ³ig offers a barely audible vocal on ""Lady Jessica and Sam"" in the form of a slow, low moan that shadows Sandoval's weary verse. They take the distance to an extreme on muffled closer ""Satellite"", which is filtered to sound as if it's creaking out of the speakers after traveling for light years on the back of a radio wave. It opens and closes with the sound of waves on a beach. It's a pretty end for a pretty record, one that will put Mazzy Star fans in a comfortably familiar place and will probably just feel comfortable to everyone else. There's no real standout track-- no ""Fade Into You"" for this decade-- but it's a good listen while it lasts, a thing of slow, sad grace.","Former Mazzy Star singer keeps the aesthetic of her former band very much alive on this collaboration withÂ My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm Ã CÃ­osÃ³ig.

Higher Than the Stars EP,The Pains of Being Pure at Heart,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6369d034d5c69bf34a5/1:1/w_160/518950bb.jpg,2009-09-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13486-higher-than-the-stars-ep/,Slumberland,"In his review of the title track from this album, Tom Breihan did us all a great service by disallowing the use of the term ""lo-fi"" with regard to the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. From the start, folks threw around that phrase when discussing the group mostly because their early material put a light wash of textural guitars on their otherwise melancholy indie pop, but, really, it was a garnish and not the main course. At their core, Pains aren't about scuzz or even shoegaze, they're a classic bookish indie pop band-- twee, you might even say-- and Higher Than the Stars, an EP of four new songs and one excellent remix, drives that point home very clearly. In addition to helping clear up misconceptions about the group's M.O., Higher Than the Stars also marks a small but important aesthetic shift for Pains. On their self-titled debut from earlier this year, the band worked within a pretty specific strain of indie-pop from the mid-80s and drew heavily from the hazy guitar pop of early My Bloody Valentine and C86 acts like Shop Assistants. But this EP demonstrates a tweaking of that sound that falls more in line with the cleaner approach of late-80s Sarah Records bands, most notably the Field Mice. That may seem like a minor distinction, but it helps to show Pains not as period fetishists, but instead a group of indie-pop aesthetes who seem to be able to operate comfortably within several different subdivisions of the genre. The song that most exemplifies this altered formula is the EP's title cut, ""Higher Than the Stars"", which is noteworthy not only for its gloss but the assurance with which it bounces along-- its twinkling synths, crisp guitar strums, and longing vocals all hitting at the right moments. I'd put it right up there with ""Come Saturday"" and ""Young Adult Friction"" as one of the best tracks in Pains' catalogue so far. Though perhaps not quite as dazzling, ""Falling Over"" is equally crisp, and also puts a greater emphasis on rhythm and synths (keyboardist Peggy Wang-East's playing is confident throughout) and works as a sappy ballad about the uncertainty of a potential new love. Frontman Kip Berman's sad-sack tenderness could be irritating here if it didn't sound so great, as he shields himself from hurt, singing, ""Don't you, don't you touch me... I'd fall over for you,"" in his most convincing faux-British accent to date. The two tracks that stand out as different from the pack here are ""103"" and the Saint Etienne remix of ""Higher Than the Stars"", the former a holdover from the time of the self-titled LP's recording and more in line with that style. (It's pleasant enough but probably the slightest of the batch.) The Saint Etienne remix, though, is fantastic, stretching the original's four minutes to nearly seven of the kind of tropical dance-pop the group is famous for. It also makes for an interesting complete circle here, since Saint Etienne associate Ian Catt also produced the Field Mice (whose influence, again, is clear on this EP) in the 80s, and SE covered the Field Mice's ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"". Saint Etienne's co-sign on the would-be torchbearers for this style is high praise indeed. It also further emphasizes the argument this EP makes, which is that Pains could be the most promising indie pop group around.","Highlighting the bookish indie pop at their core, this Pains EP still sounds classic and timeless, even if it's more Field Mice thanÂ Shop Assistants.

Eskimo Snow,WHY?,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a615b1335d7bf1698d4b/1:1/w_160/e984a21d.jpg,2009-09-25 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13450-eskimo-snow/,Anticon,"During an interview with Pitchfork earlier this year, WHY?'s Yoni Wolf called Eskimo Snow, ""really the least hip-hop out of anything I've ever been involved with."" This might just be a less verbally economical way of saying, ""we did this with the guy who produced the last Clientele record."" Wolf's got a dry sense of humor like that. It's telling that he put it in those terms-- though 2008's staggering Alopecia won plenty of well-deserved plaudits, the most often-heard criticism I heard was a bizarrely general one, essentially that listeners were expecting a hip-hop record and got subjected to 50 minutes of indie rock. The Anticon name must still be heavy in the streets, but the truth is, as long as Wolf continues to be as candid and vivid as he's been in the past, he'll have more in common with the expressionists of outre rap than the straight-laced indie vanguard. To a large degree, Eskimo Snow comes off like an acknowledgment of that gap rather than a collection of songs culled from the same sessions that birthed Alopecia. For better or worse,Â Eskimo Snow eschews the musical and emotional contours of Alopecia for a resigned saunter to the gallows.Â The shift is made apparent from the album's killer first line:Â ""I wear the customary clothes of my time/ Like Jesus did with no reason not to die."" But as ""These Hands"" progresses, it never builds into a larger statement, just an insular word collage. But thereafter, the latest from WHY? is almost completely devoid of the black humor that typically undercuts Wolf's most uncomfortable confessions, save for centerpiece ""Into the Shadows of My Embrace"", which serves as the album's reservoir of nebbish quotables. The drum roll that follows ""it'd take a busload of high school soccer girls to wash those hospitals off me"" could just as easily be replaced by a rimshot.Â By the song's midsection, Wolf can barely contain himself, hyperventilating, ""I wish I could feel close to somebody, but I don't feel nothing/ Now they say that I need to quit doing all this random f-f-ff...,"" biting his lip at that last word, embarrassed as much by his situation as the ease of the rhyme itself. That's pretty much the last bit of levity before the second half's unyielding bleakness. Balancing it out-- andÂ Wolf's curdled, nasal honk--Â is one of the unexpectedly pretty albums you'll come across. Much of Eskimo Snow continues in the manner of ""A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under"" (which gets reprised on the stormy piano ballad ""One Rose""), favoring loops of mallet percussion, live drumming, and acoustic guitar. ""January Twenty Something"" introduces honest-to-god vocal harmonies that blossom and split apart with surprisingly delicacy. But as the album progresses, only the brief, coiled intensity of flanger-lashed ""On Rose Walk, Insomniac"" proves to be a counterpoint to all those literal bells and whistles. Considering WHY?'s shift towards indie, the mixed meters of ""Berkeley By Hearseback"" seem influenced by Chicago post-rock. Meanwhile, many have remarked on the similarity of ""This Blackest Purse"" to the more maudlin side of Ben Folds, while the title track is in the style of the exhausted, finger-plucked acoustic send-off that served as the closer on the last couple of Death Cab albums. It is easy to focus on what's missing here-- nothing strikes with the surprising pop instincts of ""Fatalist Palmistry"" or the unsettling hilarity of Wolf's far-fetched and yet somehow affecting closet-cleaning about buttfucking Berliners, throwing up behind Whole Foods, or ""jerking off in an art museum john til my dick hurts"" (this line went over surprisingly well at a performance in L.A.'s Natural History Museum). But as the cryptic refrain of ""no flash photography"" gives a new dimension to the weary C&W crawl of ""Even the Good Wood Gone"", it's clear that there's a hangover to be nursed, a need to ""feel nothing"" after Alopecia had Wolf ""doomed to feel too much,"" as Pitchfork's Jason Crock said. Eskimo Snow just feels like the right kind of album for an incredibly gifted and increasingly prolific band like WHY? to release as a quick palate cleanser, reaching an endpoint of a certain sound rather than trying to top its predecessor's unmatchable extremities.","After the vulnerable masterstroke Alopecia, WHY? unleash a record that's darker in content but often gorgeous in sound.

Album,Girls,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a646b1335d7bf1698dbb/1:1/w_160/d0617cec.jpeg,2009-09-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13477-album/,True Panther,"Girls frontman Christopher Owens grew up in the Children of God cult. His older brother died as a baby because the cult didn't believe in medical attention. His dad left. He and his mother lived around the world, and the cult sometimes forced his mother to prostitute herself. As a teenager, Owens fled and lived as a Texas gutter-punk for a while. Then a local millionaire took Owens under his wing, and Owens moved to San Francisco. There, he and Chet ""JR"" White formed Girls, and recorded Album, their debut album, under the influence of just about every kind of pill they could find. As band origin stories go, this one is so epically sad and squalid and ultimately triumphant that nobody could make it up. It's the sort of story that can overwhelm a band so completely that you never really hear their music; you only hear the story. So it's a tribute to Album that you don't need to know one word of that first paragraph to hear it as what it is: a dizzily powerful piece of work. That's partly because you don't need to know Owens' story to intuit that there's something going on here. When I saw the band play SXSW, knowing nothing about them beyond their compulsively listenable ""Hellhole Ratrace"" single, I wrote that the band's music sounds ""like the work of one deeply weird and possibly sad person."" That's largely because of Owens' enormously evocative voice, a hiccupy thing that feels like a direct descendant of every sad nerd genius in pop history. The immediate obvious reference point is Elvis Costello, but you can also hear shards of Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison and Paul McCartney and Morrissey. Owens never brays or moans or snarls; he sings simple songs about heartbreak with the internalized classicism of someone who's been listening to oldies radio in his sleep his whole life. He's playful; he has fun with it. But there's always a wounded, raggedy quaver at the back of his throat, one that implies worlds of hurt beyond the simple breakup songs he's singing. And make no mistake; most of the songs on the Girls album are about, well, girls. Owens reportedly wrote much of the album in the aftermath of a bad breakup. There's one song called ""Laura"" and another called ""Lauren Marie"", so he's presumably got someone in mind. But he never falls into emo laceration, instead delivering his sentiments with conversational directness: ""You've been a bitch, I've been an ass/ I don't wanna point the finger; I just know I don't like this, I don't wanna do this."" But even his most innocuous classic-pop lyrics hint at a deep-seated fucked-upedness. On ""Goddamn"", he gets downright creepy over glimmering acoustic guitars and ""Ghost Town"" percussion-rattles: ""Just give all your attention to me."" ""Headache"" is just as fragile and reverby, and Owens cops a half-joking lounge-singer baritone to sing, ""Let's be the people that we want to be/ Let's live like we could never part""-- implying, of course, that he's not already the person he wants to be. And he starts out ""Hellhole Ratrace"", the band's first single, with this: ""I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel."" He's a broken man. Musically, Album is mostly sunny Beach Boys pastiche, but it's not the kajillionth indie attempt at orchestral Pet Sounds majesty. Rather, it's simple and forthright early Beach Boys stuff: compact guitar-jangles, sha-la-la harmonies, muffled heartbeat drums. It sounds great. And even though it has a basic core sound, Album manages to cover a lot of aesthetic ground in its 44 minutes. Without being showy about it, they swing from rushing power-pop to acoustic campfire laments to ""Morning Light"", which is one of the most fully realized slices of shoegaze revivalism I've heard in years. If they'd made an entire album of songs like ""Morning Light"", Girls would be getting a ton of blog love, but they decided to go for something at once messier and simpler. And they're getting a ton of blog love anyway. There's a pillowy quality to many of the sounds on Album, but this isn't lo-fi or glo-fi or whatever. Rather, every little production flourish is so much a part of the whole that you don't notice it until the 10th or 15th listen. On ""Lust for Life"", for instance, there's a melodica that bubbles up on the second half. ""Big Bad Mean Motherfucker"" is joyous beach-party stuff, but there's a beautifully discordant guitar solo in there. ""Hellhole Ratrace"" builds to an epic guitar whoosh halfway through its seven minutes, but the beat's hammer never quite falls; the drums stay just slightly off. The guitars on ""Lauren Marie"" twang like Duane Eddy's. All this stuff functions like the sleigh bells on Liz Phair's ""Fuck and Run"": subtle little intuitive details that you might never notice but that add to the devastating whole. The canniness of Album's production choices and the scuzzy depression of the lyrics and the gut-level songwriting instincts, along with everything else about the record, add up to something elusive and fascinating-- maybe even heartbreaking.","Girls have been the subject of a steadily building buzz based on some excellent singles, and they deliver on that promise here in a big way.

Colonial Drones,Hallelujah the Hills,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61cb1335d7bf1698d5f/1:1/w_160/8ee7ca1e.jpg,2009-09-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13461-colonial-drones/,Misra,"Hallelujah the Hills are still taking cues from both 1990s lo-fi and ambitious 2000s indie, but they've jumped to the accelerated class on their second album, Colonial Drones. Despite the record opening with the sound of a cello, if that collage art on the album's cover doesn't remind you of Guided by Voices, the rest of the opening track certainly will. ""A Guide to the World's Most Fantastic Monsters"" picks up on a lesson well learned from GbV-- not bluster or inscrutability, but brevity. It's a hell of a rallying cry for a midtempo opening track, and when the call-and-response comes in, the song really lifts off; not a second is wasted. They pull the same effective trick on ""Station"", with singer Ryan Walsh's weary double-tracked voice sounding a little more like Conor Oberst than Robert Pollard on that one, which is twice as charming for being half as long as you'd expect. But the rest of the time-- starting with the quick waltz-time strum of ""The Might Come Back Club""-- the band gets down to sounding like real, mature musicians, with Walsh ranting and occasionally bleating out the vivid lyrics he's becoming known for. Walsh's lyrics are less concerned with cramming syllables and sounding ""literary"" and more about detailed scenes with curious abstractions recurring throughout, which linger in the mind even when the melodies don't. It's an album of haunted minds, ominous figures that could be angels or devils, dreams delivered from character to character, and forgotten boxes of tapes in garages that wind up meaning the difference between life or death. The music is just as ambitious, but it's much the same ambition heard on many of the most popular indie records of the past few years: the starched-collar strings, the buoyant brass countermelodies, the ranting speak-sung vocals, and, of course, the big crescendos. They're still played tastefully-- the record's most cautious and polite arrangement, ""Oxus Pagoda"", is its irresistibly melodic. That track has all the strings and horns and syncopated drums set apart by the warm hum of organ underneath; this, and not the number of instruments on the track, shows the band's attention to detail. While the record's runtime could have been trimmed, the LP does have a welcome diversity, from swaying country-inflected tunes like ""Put the Gurus in Charge"" and ""Classic Tapes"" to more tense, layered workouts like ""Blank Passports"" and ""Allied Lions"". When coming around to the tooting horns of ""Variations on the Grand National Championships"" or the slow-motion string plucking of ""The Echo Sequence"", you may get a creeping jaded feeling at the big crescendos and polite arrangements that have become a calling card for what a lot of people consider indie; of course, people still like those calling cards, and Hallelujah the Hills do them as well as most. The band has more command of that style this time around, and that'll make fans happy and hopefully bring in some more. But the band is good enough, and Walsh is compelling enough as a writer, that they have me wishing they'd step outside of it a little next time.","Still taking cues from both 1990s lo-fi and ambitious 2000s indie, Hallelujah the Hills continue to expand and improve their sound.

Expressions,Music Go Music,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61813d19756521390dc/1:1/w_160/5ea45ee8.jpg,2009-09-24 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13457-expressions/,Secretly Canadian,"If an album's worth were solely measured by how successfully it accomplishes its stylistic goals, then Expressions would be one of the best albums of the year. The debut full-length from the semi-mysterious collective known as Music Go Music-- a collection of all nine tracks culled from the three 12"" the band released over the last year and a half-- is an obvious homage to ABBA, the Carpenters, ELO, and other purveyors of the unironic, sugary pop that was a mainstay of 1970s radio. And perhaps not since those bands themselves has someone made such assuredly hooky, dramatically multi-layered tunes such as these. In an era when bedroom-acoustic intimacy and laptop-pop accessibility seem to rule independent music (picking up, thanks to widely available technology, where punk left off with its ""anyone can make music"" ethos), it's refreshing to hear a band embracing overblown sentiment and matching it with massive choruses and sprawling production. ""Light of Love"", the single from their first 12"", is still MGM's best song, replete with bouncing ""woah woah woah""s, wonderfully cheesy, spacey synthesizer effects, joyous handclaps, and Gala Bell's buttery smooth, echo-laden vocals. But hearing all their songs collected together for the first time, you'll notice that the band isn't content to simply master the epic joy of Scandinavian pop, but also embraces the darker, sadder, funkier impulses of their influences. Both ""Warm in the Shadows"", with its disco bass and wakka-wakka guitars, and album opener ""I Walk Alone"", with its churning minor-key synth figure, build shadowy, roiling beds for Bell's smooth, astral tones (often harmonized against each other or simply overdubbed into endless reverberations) for an effect akin to that on ABBA's ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"". And piano ballad ""Goodbye, Everybody"" is the kind of simple, sentimental, ""Rainy Days and Mondays""-like weeper that ruled the Adult Contemporary charts in 1971, bolstered by Bell's (mostly unadorned) sadly sweet soprano singing clichÃ©s like, ""it can't be right to feel so wrong,"" with such earnestness that it will make you nostalgic for a time before such a sentiment was a clichÃ©. Though the band may disagree, it does not diminish the magic of Music Go Music's time-machine pop to admit who its members are. Though they go by aliases-- Gala Bell, Kamer Maza, TORG-- the band's core is actually comprised of Meredith and David Metcalf and Adam Siegel of gospel-pop Los Angelinos Bodies of Water, and their lineup is augmented (as recent live performances and videos have proven) by members of Beachwood Sparks, Mezzanine Owls, and the Chapin Sisters. I mention this, not to dispel the band's welcome mystery in this age of the overshare, but to elucidate why this blatant attempt at retread feels so fresh. Bodies of Water, even on their sepia-toned last album, A Certain Feeling, are known for three things: the revival-tent fervor of their performances, the goosebump-inducing vocals of their female frontperson, and lyrically, the religious power they ascribe to love. Music Go Music take those attributes and-- to borrow another clichÃ© from rock's past-- turn them up to 11. This makes for songs that percolate with the urgency and precision of Bodies of Water's best, but with an added pop gloss often lacking from their music. Admittedly, if you own MGM's three 12""s, then there is nothing new for you here. And sure, there is something about Expressions that feels akin to listening to karaoke-- compliments to the songwriters who could so well imitate the likes of BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson in their own originals-- but with a voice like Meredith Metcalf's (sorry, ""Gala Bell's"") singing the sort of addicting, tangy melodies that her briny soprano was made for, even karaoke can be thrilling. After all, I would rather hear Music Go Music's silky, expertly handled faux version of ABBA than Pierce Brosnan's embarrassing verbatim one any day.","The debut from this Secretly Canadian band isÂ an obvious homage to ABBA, the Carpenters, ELO, and other purveyors of the unironic, sugary pop of 1970s radio.

Us,Brother Ali,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a645c0084474cd0c090a/1:1/w_160/381cece4.jpg,2009-09-24 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13475-us/,Rhymesayers,"A girl whose first sexual experience was a molestation is encouraged to overcome her trauma and learn to feel real love. White Americans are confronted with their role in the legacy of slavery and their responsibility for the cultural and social structures it left behind. Immigrants, a child of divorced parents, and a self-hating gay teenager get a keep-your-head-up. The ostracized, leprous son of a plantation owner learns to sing from the field hands, only to reject his family's adulation of his talents when he realizes they won't let those same field hands inside their house. These are some of the ways Brother Ali focuses his storytelling talents on Us, and I just wanted to mention that as soon as possible because some people may prefer an advance warning when a rap album is filled with what is perceived as moralistic sermonizing. But this isn't ""moralistic sermonizing"" where Brother Ali is concerned-- it's displays of a humane, often-troubled conscience. For an MC who has so many tracks which denote his ""bad motherfucker"" status, his persona's dominated by a welcoming strain of populist empathy, an attitude that offers an accessible solidarity just for listening. And unless you happen to be someone who thinks he's a better MC than Ali is, this man will not actually talk down to you, no matter how sociopolitically agitated he gets. If rap didn't exist, he'd be the greatest high school guidance counselor in Minneapolis. But as a talent in a scene that holds decades' worth of some of the most sensitive identity politics of any popular culture movement in the last 50 years, Brother Ali has had to put that populism to good use. The political material on Us is powerful without being self-righteous: ""The Travelers"" runs through every dehumanizing abuse in the slave trade in its gutwrenching first verse, then spends the second hinging on culpability, complete with an admission that he's been ""terrified to admit it's wrong/ 'Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on."" The blues-cadenced ""Breakin' Dawn"", meanwhile, works in both a literal and allegorical sense, with the story of the master's son taught to sing by the slaves a fable that also hints at latter-day whitewashing in the music industry (and, by potential extension, that theoretical listener who bumps Brother Ali without paying heed or respect to his influences). And while ""Games"" resembles your typical get-off-the-corner message rap on the surface, Ali puts himself on the hustler's level instead of scolding him. Still, the man does have his limits: ""House Keys"" has his family moving downstairs from the second floor of a duplex only to find that his new upstairs neighbors are a bunch of noisy, bickering small-time drug dealers, a problem which he addresses by sneaking into their place when they're out, stealing all their shit, and selling it. He does have moments where he makes himself the subject, whether needy and heartbroken on ""You Say (Puppy Love)"" or rolling his eyes at haters on ""Crown Jewel"". And there's still plenty of times-- ""Bad Mufucker Pt. II"", ""'Round Here"", ""Fresh Air""-- where he seems content to rattle off gratitude-swagger testimonials to his own career, a tendency that's served his style well from the beginning. I've read a few dismissals of Ali's style as a blatant copy of Pharoahe Monch's, and I don't quite hear it beyond the subtle debt practically every indie rapper ever owes Organized Konfusion: Ali's lyricism forgoes Monch's rewind-provoking abstraction for an approach heavy on straightforward scene-setting, willing to sacrifice complex internal rhyme schemes and rimshot metaphors if it means he can paint you a clearer picture. With those strengths, he's somewhere between the intense street-scholar style of Freeway-- who appears, along with Joell Ortiz, on the shit-talk highlight ""Best@it""-- and an eloquent everyman like Murs, who has a non-rapping cameo telling an amusing story about how Brother Ali's mere presence cooled down a tense situation. Dude can still be pretty acrobatic when he wants to-- ""The Preacher"" makes for a hell of a skeptic-converter-- yet there's also a clarity and non-pretension to his lyrics that, coupled with the smooth rasp of his voice, makes them fully attention-commanding. It should be noted that this album's original title was Street Preacher, a concept that still manifests in a few spots (like the Chuck D intro and the track it segues into, ""The Preacher""). And ANT, who's produced nearly everything Ali's spit over since his Rhymesayers debut, Shadows on the Sun, turns in a characteristic set of clean, crisp modern soul that accompanies his usual 1970s-skewing R&B touchstones (mournfully-glimmering minimalist g-funk on ""Slippin' Away""; slinky Bar-Kays strut on ""Fresh Air"") with a gospel-soul current. It's a proper backdrop for an album that stands as the most deeply thought-provoking work of Brother Ali's career, an album that draws its strengths from the simultaneous expression of sympathy toward the people in the songs and anger toward the shit they've gone through. The album's title track is gospel personified-- a choir, handclaps, and a rapt MC laying down his idealistic vision of an America that still feels a long way off: ""Can't nobody be free unless we're all free/ There's no me and you, it's just us.""","What comes across as moralistic sermonizing from lesser MCs here is the work of a rapper with a humane, often-troubled conscience.

Forget the Night Ahead,The Twilight Sad,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62d9d034d5c69bf348c/1:1/w_160/cdd369a8.jpg,2009-09-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13493-forget-the-night-ahead/,Fat Cat,"Brooder James Graham is not a great storyteller. His mission-- along with his band of post-Mogwai Scottish noisemakers-- is to evoke. When Graham repeated lines like, ""the kids are on fire in the bedroom,"" and, ""in my dreams I watch Emily dance,"" on the Twilight Sad's debut LP, 2007's Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters, the specifics were left hauntingly up in the air. It's a tactic used by several of the singer's self-serious forebears-- from Joy Division's Ian Curtis to Interpol's Paul Banks-- but one step too far into the abstract and there's too little for listeners to hang their own shared dilemmas upon. With follow-up Forget the Night Ahead, Graham takes his cryptic musings into a pitch-black place, but he still connects enough to make all the fraught drama worthwhile-- especially when coupled with guitarist Andy MacFarlane's still-overwhelming Kevin Shields-by-way-of-Thurston Moore torrents. Since Fourteen Autumns contained many (albeit vague) references to a severely traumatic childhood, it often sounded like a form of coded primal scream therapy. The album cover showed a cartoon mother angrily waving her masked son away; the album's companion EP, Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did, showed the masked son suffocating the same mother with a pillow. With his mommy and daddy issues sufficiently exorcised, Graham moves onto more adult worries with Forget the Night Ahead-- there's still no summer or spring in Twilight Sad World, and the days are even shorter this time around. And there's no youthful spirit to balance out the dread, either, as it's allowed to run amok throughout the album's 11 punishing tracks. To wit, the closest thing resembling a love song, the roiling ""Interrupted"", is topped off by Graham murmuring, ""you and I will bury them all."" It will not be played at weddings. Funerals, maybe. While Graham has done many interviews over the last few years, he likes to keep mum when it comes to the meaning of his words. ""I've never told anyone what my songs are about, and I don't intend to,"" he once said. And, in a recent Pitchfork interview, he had this to say about Forget the Night Ahead: ""Things happened to me and [the album is] basically about trying to forget what happened."" Such tactics are hardly enlightening, but they are smart. Because this band's tempest of meat-slap drums and fire-engine-from-hell distortion makes the mind go to disturbing places with very little provocation. ""The Room"" is not a particularly detailed song title, but given the track's shadowy images of ""nails in our feet"" and a creepy ""grandson's toy in the corner,"" it's pretty clear this four-walled space is not all that welcoming. ""Look what you have done,"" says Graham on the song, without telling-- its central offense is as diabolical as you want it to be. The same fill-in-the-blank logic goes for careening stand-out ""That Birthday Present"", which is not about a Barnes and Noble gift certificate. Possibly alluding to an alcohol-addled friend/lover who can't help but miss their own candles burning out while going ""nowhere,"" the track is a fireball of frustration and anger and gliding guitar corrosion. ""The curtains closed again,"" sings Graham, offering an apropos visual to his own writing style-- listening to Forget the Night Ahead is like looking at silhouetted neighbors through a draped window; the shapes are there but it's hard to say whether someone's being murdered or preparing the family dinner. With any sort of levity galaxies upon galaxies away, the LP's non-stop direness can read like a self-fulfilling prophecy, i.e., while it may be hard to tell each song apart, the overall effect is not easy to shake. ""You'll never have some honest fun,"" goes Graham on ""Made to Disappear"", perhaps offering a bit of self-flagellation for his own sins. And there is an almost puritanical streak running through the record-- shame, ghosts, and ""people downstairs"" are constantly encroaching on the singer's consciousness. So is Graham really such an immaculate downer? Guitarist MacFarlane gave his front man up ever-so-slightly in a recent interview, admitting that Graham often ""sits in his hotel room on the Skype and we all go out partying"" while on tour. While the hopeless, unrequited pair in the middle of ""Seven Years of Letters"" could seemingly end up simultaneously sipping poison, in reality, they just might be bawling through a webcam. We'll never know. Luckily, the Twilight Sad deal with the real world on their own heavily shrouded terms.","Evocative, emo-ish lyrics andÂ Kevin Shields-by-way-of-Thurston Moore torrents of noise once again color the work of this Scottish band.

Unmap,Volcano Choir,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64a9d034d5c69bf34d2/1:1/w_160/56fd6e72.jpg,2009-09-24 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13506-unmap/,Jagjaguwar,"There's a moment in ""The Wolves (Act I and II)"", a song on Justin Vernon's debut album as Bon Iver, For Emma, Forever Ago, where you first suspect that there's more going on with this dude than meets the eye. Up until that point, the record is, as advertised, ascetic and stripped down, the product of a person alone in a cabin for months with only a guitar for company. The songs early on bring to mind snow, wood, creaky furniture, drawn breaths-- organic materials that could have been just as easily assembled 80 years ago. But as Vernon sings the ""what might have been lost"" refrain in ""Wolves"", you hear something strange creeping in: One of the many voices, which are layered and harmonized, both full and falsetto, is run through some kind of vocoder-like effect. It's subtle at first, added without drawing much attention to itself, but it even so it feels like the floor dropping out. Just like that, the song is broken wide open, and Vernon's music is infused with a sense of unexpected possibility. That boundless feeling was confirmed on Bon Iver's Blood Bank EP, released at the beginning of this year. One if its songs, ""Woods"", was an a cappella number with every voice processed, as Vernon stretched and trilled the phrases like Crosby, Stills, Nash, and T-Pain. Yes, these effects became absurdly ubiquitous last year, and the mere fact that it was used was nothing special. But Vernon is operating in a milieu-- an emotionally driven singer-songwriter on a noted indie rock label-- where people don't usually do such things. Especially so early in a promising career, where you're not sure how your audience might react. My sense is that Vernon was able to put expectations aside; he had a sound in mind and he went for it, without worrying too much about what a ""Bon Iver"" song should be. And that in itself was exciting. So after Emma's deserved success, the nifty stopgap EP, and Vernon's long stretch on the road winning new fans, his next move proves to be yet another welcome curveball: teaming with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees for a short album of experimental pop as Volcano Choir. Vernon's voice is one of the most distinctive going right now, so you can always hear him in this music. But at the same time, Unmap in no way feels like any sort of follow-up to Emma. This is partly because these tracks aren't really songs. Words mean very little, and there's not much in the way of verses or choruses. Instead, Vernon's voice becomes a texture, a tool for shading the tracks and bringing them into focus. Collections of Colonies of Bees, who have over the last couple of records proven to be the rare instrumental rock band with ideas about how to keep things both surprising and musical, bring Vernon into their world, which turns out to be a very good thing. When it all comes together, the results are dazzling. ""Seeplymouth"" is one highlight. With its repeating guitar chimes and chanted voices, it begins with a loose, jazzy feel weirdly reminiscent of Peanuts composer VinceÂ Guaraldi. But then, after a sung passage by Vernon, it continues to build in intensity until it's a huge, pumping mass of crashing drums and wailed voices, something apocalyptic and almost unbearably intense. Equally impressive, and much closer to a conventional song, is the following ""Island, IS"", with its hyper-repetitive keyboard pulse drawn from modern classical, loping drums, and Vernon singing mesmerizingly opaque phrases that sound like the product of automatic writing. Heard back-to-back, these two tracks suggest a sort of fusion between the U.S. and UK versions of post-rock. There's definitely some Talk Talk here, in the way assumptions about sound and structure are re-thought from the ground up and used in service of a new kind of song. But there's also a sense of Tortoise's studiousness, the way existing genres are toyed with and then broken down for parts. But despite the looseness and the grab-bag approach, the best of the songs on Unmap-- the airy opener ""Husks and Shells"", with its plucked acoustic and Vernon multi-tracked into reverb-heavy choir, and ""Still"", which is a longer, better version of the EP's ""Woods"" augmented by droning keyboards and Steve Reich-like figures-- feel right as rain, like these weird mash-ups were there all along, just waiting to be discovered. Some of the tracks are unformed explorations that weren't pursued as far as they could have been, but even these have something to recommend. ""Dote"" puts Vernon in an echoing cavern and stretches his voice out to a rich, gothic drone that sounds like something Kranky would have loved to put out in the late 1990s. But it lasts only for three minutes and feels like it's just getting rolling when it crashes sharply into ""And Gather"". But then, fortunately, the latter is another short, intriguing track, bringing to mind Animal Collective's Sung Tongs with its acoustic guitar figure, handclaps, and chants. So where half-formed ideas are found, sharp editing keeps the album moving along. The only track that doesn't work is ""Mbira in the Morass"", which finds Vernon straining for a kind of bent soul vibe over a shapeless background heavy on the titular instrument. Still, one skip on such a truly experimental record-- they're really trying stuff here, not totally sure if it's going to work-- is an impressive feat. And for Vernon, the possibilities now seem even more vast.","Justin Vernon of Bon Iver teams up with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees for a loose, weird, and rewarding album.

Origin: Orphan,The Hidden Cameras,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a633c0084474cd0c08de/1:1/w_160/a7e75d28.jpg,2009-09-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13488-origin-orphan/,Arts & Crafts,"Can you make a mature album with a band called the Hidden Cameras? It's been an appropriate stage name over the past decade for Canada's Joel Gibb, describing aptly the explicit sexuality of his lyrics and the dark undertone hiding beneath his baroque orchestrations and genteel vocals. But  most of all, the name telegraphs the band's distinctive playfulness (if we're thinking hidden cameras more in the ""Candid Camera"" sense than the Erin Andrews sense), a joyful glee that turns their concerts into pep rallies and makes Gibb's songs humorous without being novelty. But the inevitable trajectory of any band, any life really, is to evolve from goofy prankster fun to rote adult seriousness. That's not always a bad thing, musically, but can the foundations of a concept like the Hidden Cameras-- with its Oscar Wilde wryness-- withstand the thematic shift? When asked about the old ""jubilant"" material, Gibb told a hometown website, ""that naivety is kind of worn, I would say."" Depressing words from the man who titled his last record with perhaps the most economical description of the band's sound and message to date (Awoo) and who bookended his best album with two songs about watersports-- and I don't mean synchronized swimming. Like a pitcher tipping his curveball, Origin: Orphan signals this increased gravity in familiar fashion: two minutes of thick drone to introduce the dreary ""Ratify the New"". Wide-screen ambitious, the crescendos are both too bleak to be inspirational and too mannered to be cathartic. The album's other landmarks are equally drenched in gloom: with its chattering preset drums and air-raid guitars, the self-loathing title track is easily the dreariest thing Gibb's ever set to tape, and  closer ""Silence Can Be a Headline"" is a sludge through last-dance arpeggios and maudlin strings. Only ""Walk On"" stands out among the new-direction material, retaining the boisterous chamber pop the Hidden Cameras are known for, but cranking the tempo down to a New Orleans funeral crawl with Gibb's searching tenor fitfully peeking through. But as depressing as these hit-or-mostly-miss attempts to slow down and get serious may be, it's even more deflating to hear the songs that approach the Hidden Cameras' old team spirit but fall short. ""He Falls to Me"" and ""Colour of a Man"" both contain disappointingly monotone vocal lines rather than Gibb's typically ornate vocal runs, and show glimpses of hitting the raucous folk-punk strides off earlier material before slipping out of gear. Only in a couple of places does the band's old giddiness shine through. ""Underage"" is a brief reprise of Gibb's sauciness, with a risquÃ© refrain-- ""let's do it like we're underage""-- made taboo when Gibb asks his partner, ""I'll pretend you're seven, you'll pretend I'm eight."" The song's Graceland-ish afro/electro-pop vibe is also very in tune with indie trends, a timeliness the Hidden Cameras come by honestly after peppering their songs with Ladysmith-lite backing chants. And Gibb adds a synth-pop edge-- flirting dangerously with the band's Magnetic Fields resemblance-- on the 8-bit beat of ""Do I Belong?"" and by borrowing Pete Townshend's old keyboard for the contagious ""In the NA"". But when Gibb blandly promises there to ""marry one day in the NA,"" it's hard not to recall his impish proposal to ""Ban Marriage"" three albums ago, just as the gay marriage movement began to catch fire. That mischief is largely missing from Origin: Orphan, and the lack of lyrical cleverness seems to have infected the music as well, making for a mostly cloudy listen from a formerly sunny-day band. You can't blame Joel Gibb for wanting to grow up, but nobody wants to watch a hidden camera unless it's focused on something fun and forbidden.","Joel Gibb makes his ""mature"" album, trading the joyful glee of past Hidden Cameras work for increased gravity and seriousness.

69: The Legendary Adventures of a Filter King,Carl Craig,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6349d034d5c69bf349d/1:1/w_160/00ff5e72.jpg,2009-09-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13495-69-the-legendary-adventures-of-a-filter-king/,Planet E,"You probably won't be able to find a copy of this. In fact, you probably have more people on your Facebook friends list than there are copies of this floating around out there. For one thing, it's a vinyl-only, 5x12"" release. For another, it reissues material few beyond techno freaks heard the first time around, in such a way that even fewer people are going to be able to hear it now.Â I'm of two minds about this. On the one hand, it's quasi-minimalist, breakbeat-driven techno-funk, designed to be mixed. So the format, at least, makes sense. Even Craig's releases as 69 avoid his late-era repetition through their cut-up synth riffage, alternating between sandpaper raw and new-age relaxed, and unpredictably looped breaks, they're still designed to be diced hard between two turntables. It's the availability that rankles. Filter King finally collects some of Craig's best work, out of a large and hard to track down catalog. 69 tracks like ""Desire"" sound A-OK at home, treating the calloused functionalism of first-wave hip-house to a warm, salted bath in Detroit keyboards. Far be it from me to tell the man how he should administer his own music, but a wider release-- even if not on CD and/or digital-- wouldn't feel quite so... alienatingly cultish. Because this is not difficult music. Craig-as-69 was about the overlap between the rave's peak and the post-club late-night drive, the ""innerspace journeys"" rhetoric of techno and the crowd-pleasing bumpiness of urban radio from multiple eras. ""Jam the Box"" is so unpretentiously rugged I wouldn't have been surprised to hear it in a Baltimore club music mix. On the other end of the 69 spectrum, ""Microlovr"" is as spectrally wiggy as anything on Warp between the bleep era and the wilderness period of Autechre-ian over-programming. But crucially there's always a body-rock undertow that stuff often abjured. As a collection, Filter King is all-things-to-all-people for fans of the ""funky and proud"" side of electronic dance. Techno-identified stuff in the aughts still has plenty to recommend it, but I'd take the low-res wallop of Filter King over the perfectly sculpted sleekness of cross-continental new-millennium minimalism nine times out of 10. Sure, compared to the bite-sized editing of Hawtin school graduates, the antic beat to ""Frequency Finale"" sounds like Toni Basil's ""Mickey"" with two poppers jammed up its nostrils. That's why it's so fun. As someone who's mostly immune to the dry, deadening arpeggios of Craig's much-lauded 21st-century remix work, I appreciated the reminder of a time when he could swing, or get dumb, so effortlessly. Again, you want to deduct points for restricting the music to obsessives, but like those hardcore bands still releasing seven-inches (and Jim O'Rourke), Craig's decision can be read as a bracing fuck-you to all those .rar blogs.","Detroit techno legend collects lesser-known older material originally created under his 69 moniker, reissuing it as aÂ vinyl-only, 5x12"" release.

Year in the Kingdom,J. Tillman,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6249d034d5c69bf3477/1:1/w_160/b88cb04a.jpg,2009-09-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13467-year-in-the-kingdom/,Western Vinyl,"J. Tillman's got one a hell of a voice, of course: The newest Fleet Foxes member wasn't just plopped down behind the drumkit post-Sun Giant 'cuz he gives good beard. It merits mention that Tillman's been crafting hushed folk yearners for years, and that Year in the Kingdom is Tillman's second LP of 2009.Â And it's right around here that we can stop bringing up those other dudes; whereas Foxes trade in the precise and the pristine, Tillman's songs drift along like a piece of ragged wood in the river, a little gnarled but easygoing nevertheless. He's also dealing in a much more contemporary style of folk, kinda, taking plenty of cues from Mark Kozelek's placidly expansive work with Sun Kil Moon and even more recently Bon Iver's ambient whirl. Tillman's records-- and there's no shortage-- are quiet, pensive, unassuming things, Sunday morning kick-around music. And, while the loose, oft-airy tunes can occasionally feel inexact, when cloaked in that voice and a few inspired rattletrap arrangements, you'll barely register the deficit. Year in the Kingdom kicks off with its tidy title track, a strummy, stripped-way-back affair with nothing more than Tillman and his guitar. It's a pleasant enough intro, but I'd have gone with the significantly more adorned ""Crosswinds"" to kick things off. Tarting Tillman's tune up is a touch of banjo and a few woos while the whistling of the wind teases out the nooks and crannies of its central melody; the effect is not unlike Jim O'Rourke's crackling but never overdone production on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, with a relatively straightaway song taking on new dimension with the addition of a few key elements. Tillman's long been good at coloring in his compositions on wax; his partiality to slow and steady song structure and his avoidance of most vocals besides his own does leave plenty of room to screw around, but there's an incidental feel to the extraneous noise here, in service of the song rather than some kind [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| of cloak. As a lyricist, not unlike Foxes' Robin Pecknold, he leans on the pastoral pretty hard, and there's some references to laying a lamb on somebody I suspect might just be biblical. But even when they fail to connect on their own terms, there's a journeyman feel to his words as they unspool (helped along by his lived-in pipes) that conveys meaning even when it's not necessarily there, evoking images of long walks under the stars and that sort of thing. That, plus Tillman's intimate, close-miced voice, does lend Year in the Kingdom a lonesome, somber tone, one Tillman-- a funny, amicable dude, if you've ever heard him clowning on himself at a Fleet Foxes gig-- would do well to shake on occasion.Â Next time, maybe; for now, the stout, supine Year in the Kingdom, Tillman's second fine record of the year, will certainly do.","The newest Fleet Foxes member hasÂ been crafting hushed folk for years, and he stays prolific as a solo artist with this, his second LP of the year.

Between My Head and the Sky,Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61b9d034d5c69bf345f/1:1/w_160/9139bd4e.jpg,2009-09-23 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13460-between-my-head-and-the-sky/,Chimera,"In her 76 years, Yoko Ono has been forced to lead a series of double lives-- as a mother and celebrity activist; as esteemed avant-garde/proto-punk icon and reviled Beatles breaker-upper; as a still-active conceptual artist and administrative gatekeeper to one of the most lucrative pop-song catalogues in the world. And this month, all those lives are playing out simultaneously-- it's either extremely fortuitous or unfortunate timing that Ono's first album of all-new material in nine years arrives in the wake of the 09-09-09 Beatles bonanza (in which, regrettably, she has once again been cast as the villain). But while the rest of the world straps on video-game gizmos and pretends to be John Lennon, Ono is resurrecting her late husband's spirit through a much-more subtle gesture-- by crediting her new album to the group they debuted onstage in Toronto 40 years ago this month, the Plastic Ono Band. Of course, the Plastic Ono Band was always more a collaborative concept than a solidified band line-up; it's not like the name's appearance on the cover of Between My Head and the Sky portends the return of Eric Clapton or Ringo Starr to the fold. But the new Plastic Ono Band stays true to the original's loose, friends-and-family vibe, recruiting son Sean Ono Lennon, his former partner Yuka Honda (ex-Cibo Matto), and fellow Japanese art-pop maverick Cornelius, among others. And after a series of releases (2007's Yes, I'm a Witch and Open Your Box) that updated Ono's signature songs with help from the many artists she's influenced (Cat Power, Le Tigre), the reclamation of the Plastic Ono Band name-- and specifically, its exploratory aesthetic-- signals that Ono is ready to plow forward once again. Opener ""Waiting for the D Train"" wastes no time getting the wheels in motion, with Yoko's echo-drenched squeals driving a berserker garage-rock rhythm that's less about the mundane feeling of waiting for a subway car than the giddily dangerous sensation of riding it off the rails. That same night-in-Manhattan energy manifests itself in a decidedly different manner on the LCD-like electro-disco workout ""The Sun Is Down"", contrasting Ono's monotone title mantra with layers of huffing and puffing vocal tics that evoke the carnal, animalistic promise of the moonlight. Completing the album's solid opening trifecta is ""Ask the Elephant"", a slice of sax-squawked absurdist funk that showcases the percussive quality of Ono's voice, recalling the heady, hypno-grooves of 1971's incomparable Fly. But Between My Head and the Sky becomes a bit of a muddle in the middle, with Plastic Ono Band's free-form approach yielding less satisfying results. And the tracklist momentum gets tripped by the fact that some songs feel like rough sketches for the ones that immediately follow: while the aquatic sound effects and wordless, orgasmic coos of ""Moving Mountains"" provide little in the way of payoff, the same devices are put to more effective use in the Krautrockin' ""Calling"". And if the mid-tempo, reggaefied exercise ""Hashire, Hashire"" doesn't get interesting until starts Ono unleashing her creepy, crying wails in the final minute, the ensuing title track picks up on that cue, placing those unsettling sounds atop a tough porno-funk groove, and coming on like Serge Gainsbourg's Historie De Melody Nelson by way of The Exorcist. Between My Head and the Sky simmers down considerably in its closing third, shifting away from boisterous band jams toward meditative tone poems and piano pieces. The album's longest song is its most serene-- ""Feel the Sand"", a ripple of acoustic oscillations that aren't too many campfires removed from Animal Collective's Sung Tongs-- but also its most trite, with Yoko dispensing a stream of New Agey eco-slogans (""listen to the sound of the planet"") like a yoga instructor. More affecting is the album's closing string of piano ballads, which preach a similar ideal of universal love, but from the mournful perspective of someone who's spent many years of her life fighting for it and then suddenly dealing with its absence. Were it not for the fact that she's just recently launched her own label (Chimera Music), you'd think Ono had planned ""I'm Going Away Smiling"" as her career send-off, a beautifully desolate I-will-survive serenade that deserves to become a drag-queen diva standard for years to come. But if this song and its equally bittersweet successor ""Higa Noburu"" suggest Ono's writing her own epitaph, the album's extremely brief final track tells a different story: amid 20 seconds of destructive sledge-hammering sounds, Ono cheerfully declares, ""It's me, I'm alive."" Only someone who's lived lives like hers could make such plain and simple words sound so defiant.","The new Plastic Ono Band stays true to the original's friends-and-family vibe, recruiting Sean Lennon, Cibo Matto's Yuka Honda, and Cornelius.

Monsters of Folk,Monsters of Folk,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6485e6ef95969320cd1/1:1/w_160/7f778ba7.jpg,2009-09-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13501-monsters-of-folk/,Shangri-La Music,"Here it is:Â Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst, My Morning Jacket's Jim James, Matt Ward, and Saddle Creek auteur Mike Mogis'Â much-ballyhooed entrÃ©e-- what one assumes is our era's Traveling Wilburys. During a 2004 collaboration- and cover-heavy tour billed ""An Evening with Bright Eyes, Jim James, and M. Ward,"" the quartet committed to making an album when time permitted. Recorded in bursts in Malibu and Omaha, Monsters of Folk often took the backseat to its creators' primary concerns. Since that tour, Oberst released three successively weak albums as Bright Eyes before leaving his own label and recasting himself as a wild-eyed, globe-trotting troubadour under his own name for Merge Records. Ward, now Oberst's labelmate, has since released four albums of retro distillations, including Volume One, the debut of his project with actress Zooey Deschanel known as She & Him. James' My Morning Jacket has grown into one of the biggest American rock bands, his distinctive, reverb-heavy vocals and his band's sharp riffs and hooks putting them somewhere between, say, Wilco and the Black Crowes. Meanwhile, Mogis has produced records by Ward, Oberst, Tilly and the Wall, Cursive, and about a dozen others. In many ways, Monsters of Folk feels like a summary statement for the inconsistent careers of the musicians behind it. Like the combined output of all four, these 15 tracks-- a mix of highs and lows, stylistic risks and reservations, songs that sound either exactly or nothing like the past of the person singing it-- are as frequently frustrating as they are satisfying. An album about God and love, neighbors and friends, it's the sort of lived-in record that too often feels too comfortable to compel. Very few of the tunes here are flawless, but most of them at least deliver something interesting. Oberst's ""Temazcal"", for instance, fumbles through a listless decoupage of pagan and Spanish images and lands more than once on maudlin lyrics that seem like Facebook status updates. ""The love we made at gunpoint wasn't love at all,"" he offers, besting himself with the next verse: ""Blew open my mind. Now it's an empty room."" But astral harmonies arch around his frail voice, ensconcing it within a warm falsetto glow. Acoustic guitars build in halos that suggest James Blackshaw with a four-track. They swell and collapse, settling against the click of programmed drums. Smart production props Ward's droopy ""Slow Down Jo"", too. He offers generic advice for a busy, maybe debauched friend, easing it out with a lassitude that makes you commiserate with the fast-living guy instead of the sensible one. But Mike Mogis' steel guitar stretches like a sigh. James wraps a gorgeous choir beneath Ward, and Oberst rotates between washed-out piano and steel drums. All those textures accomplish what the song itself cannot-- to make deceleration appealing. And though it takes a hackneyed stand on issues of mind control, media manipulation, and The Man over a droll, Western barroom bounce, ""Baby Boomer"" twists references to pirates, censors, Christopher Columbus, and big-box book stores into imprecations that are certainly clever, if not altogether provocative. If that all sounds critical of Ward and Oberst, fine: Between tracks two and 10, James takes only one lead turn, allowing the album to drift into a bland, generally mid-tempo roots-rock torpor. Ward does his nostalgic Americana best (the fragmentary ""Goodway"" and the Tennessee Two-tickin' ""Baby Boomer""). Oberst overwrites and oversings in his overwrought way (the forced and didactic ""Man Named Truth"" and the staid ""Ahead of the Curve""). These songs offer no surprises. But, with the exception of the aching, gorgeous closer ""His Master's Voice"", James' five contributions to Monsters of Folk are left turns. On ""Losin Yo Head"", the rock burst that finally ends the mid-album doldrums, he sings as if leading Cheap Trick, peeling back his trademark reverb to step in front of the album's most aggressive moment. Not coincidentally, it's one of the album's addictive tunes. Indeed, only James consistently works to move beyond his mold, a quality that's often defined My Morning Jacket's mixed catalog, too. On the gorgeous opener, ""Dear God (Sincerely M.O.F.)"", he and Mogis (the disc's stars, no question) shape a subtle soul track with harp, synthesizers, and samples drums from ""Is There Any Love"", a cut from the Numero Group's Good God! collection that's also been lifted by Kid Cudi. He passes the second and third verses to Ward and Oberst respectively, and they both handle their theological plea with care. Their distinctive voices bend to meet the difficult beat, and, as they ask these big questions of the universe, they sound sincere, approachable and interested. It's as if having to verbalize these misgivings-- ""If your love's still around/ Why do we suffer?""-- inspired a shift in their fundamental approach. The opener is as intriguing as it is unexpected. It's just too bad, then, that the rest of the album continues to ask similar questions, but never again with the same vigor or innovation.","Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst, My Morning Jacket's Jim James, M. Ward, and Saddle Creek's Mike Mogis create a folk-pop supergroup, our era's Traveling Wilburys.

Marlone,To Kill A Petty Bourgeoisie,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63e9d034d5c69bf34b7/1:1/w_160/a7743d0b.jpg,2009-09-22 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13481-marlone/,Kranky,"Since it's been such a consistent source of great experimental and drone music over the years, people tend to forget that Kranky is, to a lesser degree, also a pop label. The Chicago imprint was, of course, home to Low for a stretch and in recent years has developed a wider stable of song-friendly artists like Deerhunter and Lotus Plaza. To Kill a Petty Bourgeoisie, the Minneapolis-based two-piece of singer Jehna Wilhelm and multi-instrumentalist Mark McGee, aren't easy to place along this continuum since they operate with one foot in the avant-garde and the other in the structural and, like Low or Deerhunter, tend to draw from both schools. We last heard from the band in 2007 when it debuted with The Patron, a heady concept piece based loosely around the dangers of unchecked capitalism (more prescient now in the wake of that, uh, global economic crisis), but writers and listeners seemed to give too much weight to the record's content instead of its lush sonics. The real appeal of The Patron was the captivating interplay between the group's two members, the way McGee laid a foundation of interwoven post-rock textures over which Wilhelm could paint her ghostly vocals. With new LP Marlone, the group has smartly jettisoned the storyboard conceptualism of its previous work for a deeper exploration of this sound, and the album is more assured and focused as a result. The style To Kill a Petty Bourgeoisie pursue on the record isn't new-- you could lump them in with contemporaries Sian Alice Group, Asobi Seksu, even Palms, and there's certainly a Portishead inspiration at play-- but it's what the band does with its shoegaze and post-rock atmospheres that ultimately sets it apart. Part of it is pacing (the sequencing of the record is superb) and part of it is the delicate balance between the contrasting notions of dark and light, heavy and airy, and gloomy and hopeful. Marlone's individual songs play with these opposites: opener ""You've Gone Too Far"" explores ambient tones with wide-open spaces, expanding and contracting over its nine minutes before the punchier ""The Needle"" sweeps in and pushes things in a more forceful direction. Sometimes they achieve both in the same song. Album centerpiece ""I Will Hang My Cape in Your Closet"" (bonus points for the super goth title) takes form over a long, scraping instrumental section before Wilhelm introduces a climax of upbeat vocal chants. Most impressive is that they pull off such moments largely without the use of hooks or traditional song structures and, still, the record doesn't wander off course. Instead, TKAPB keep attention with shifts in tone and momentum that seem to appear at just the right time. The most surprising is ""In People's Homes"", a buoyant two-minute pop cut that springs up virtually out of nowhere to loosen the seriousness of Marlone's second half, which the band then follows up with the industrial dirge ""Turriptosis"". Such balance is no mean feat and is just one of several pleasant surprises the album has to offer.","OperatingÂ with one foot in the avant-garde and the other in the structural, this Kranky band hews closer to Deerhunter or Low than that label's dronier artists.

"Texas Rose, the Thaw, and the Beasts",Castanets,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62a9d034d5c69bf3483/1:1/w_160/c854f881.jpg,2009-09-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13474-texas-rose-the-thaw-and-the-beasts/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Raymond Raposa's reedy voice would sound at home in either a Village coffee shop or a roadhouse, but the pitch-dark music ranges far and wide through organic and electronic textures, often combing the two.Â The resulting overall sound is cool-- it has a lot of potential for surprises, which Raposa rarely wastes. ""No Trouble"" is among the finest examples on his sixth album of all of this at work. His filtered, distant vocal is balanced by thumping drums pushed way up in your face, the occasional squeal of a synthesizer or strummed surf chord and a couple of massive guitar outbursts that erupt like bubbling lava from the song's slow-footed shamble. ""You be my getaway car and I'll steal everything you need,"" Raposa sings just before the final eruption, ramming home the sense of unease and danger the music naturally conjures. The extremes of Castanets' sound are exemplified by ""Rose"" and ""Lucky Old Moon"". The former opens the record with a bare and dry acoustic guitar part and completely unvarnished vocal, and brings in a bit of string bass, drums, and steel guitar-- there is a tiny bit of keyboard, but it mostly sounds like the last song of the night in some godforsaken roadhouse. ""Lucky Old Moon"" opens with spaced-out keys and a drum machine and never comes back to earth, preferring to shoot Raposa through an icy void. It's a neat look for him and one of the most explicitly electronic/ambient songs on any of his albums. It's also one of many tracks on the album that operates primarily as a mood piece. Raposa's lyrics are frequently great, but in spite of that, feeling trumps songwriting for the most part on Texas Rose. He does save the best for last, though, as closer ""Dance, Dance"" shows him in complete control of his sound for over six spellbinding minutes. The song is rhythmically spare and has a harmonic structure that welcomes ebb and flow in the arrangement, and Raposa brings in small details to accent lines like, ""We stayed in, dodged our friends/ Did some drugs and our best to disappear."" It ends the album on a note of dejected but oddly graceful beauty, which is perfect territory for a guy of Raposa's talents. Overall, Texas Rose, the Thaw, and the Beasts is a good mood record, a midnight opus that sounds great while it's playing but doesn't much travel with the listener beyond its runtime.","Raymond Raposa's ramshackle folk and pitch-dark musicÂ would sound at home in either a Village coffee shop or a roadhouse.

Truelove's Gutter,Richard Hawley,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a613ea9e61561daa52b4/1:1/w_160/6f995ef0.jpg,2009-09-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13452-trueloves-gutter/,Mute,"Middle age can be an unforgiving state, and an equally difficult subject to tackle (and deal with) in pop music. Take the opposing tracks being followed by two former members of Pulp, Jarvis Cocker and Richard Hawley. Cocker has turned into a urbane elder statesman, old enough to appreciate how great things were when he was 22 yet not close to forgoing new conquests. His recent album Further Complications pulses and grinds with the energy, insecurities, and manic wit of someone trying to charm themselves back in time. It's like a twist on Grinderman's ""No Pussy Blues""-- instead of slow-building frustration from not getting any, Cocker's want is emboldened after every tryst. Alternatively, Richard Hawley maintains wistful relationships, with women and with the past. He's resigned to let time shuffle by but never quite ready to let the past disappear, which echoes through his songs like a gentle reverb. One could assemble a walking tour of his Sheffield home from the song titles and references he works into his often-melancholy tunes. On Truelove's Gutter, the guitarist and his throwback lyrical style seem to literally fade away, hovering above a more atmospheric backdrop of drawn-out notes, rich reverb, and waves of echo made in part by obscure instruments like the cristal baschet. The gorgeous, backward-looking beauty of past releases like Coles Corner, drawn in part from details of Hawley's life in the Northern English city, has shifted toward something more dark, ambient, and withdrawn. It may be too slow for many, but it's more measured than it is mundane. Hawley was reared on Elvis Presley, and is the son of a steelworker who played the blues-- this is heartland material, folks-- but listen to how he deals with faded beauty on ""Don't Get Hung Up in Your Soul"". He addresses the one-time appeal of the town not with driving rock but slow notes, pedal steel, and sad understanding, his voice cracking when he reaches for the word ""baby."" He even works in the phrase ""darkness on the edge of town."" Consider the promises Hawley makes on ""For Your Lover Give Some Time"" to his sweet Helene above plaintive, gentle strings, sounding both world-weary and wise. He will maybe drink a little less, come home earlier, complain less, and watch her mend the holes in her dress. Would these bland domestic tidbits ever factor into Cocker's advances upon a young woman? But the subtle, well-timed drop of the title refrain-- ""for your lover, give some time""-- and Hawley's promise to drop off flowers from the graveyard, elevates those details of a lived-in relationship with emotional resonance. Hawley can sound too stripped down this time out, and the two songs that hover near the 10-minute mark overplay the appeal of minimal compositions and Hawley's sweet croon. An album like this, filled with longing and a bit of resignation, may be an uneasy fit for today's mood of uncertainty and diminished opportunities. Hawley's mined a specific vein of emotion for years, and it's a testament to his skill that his hyper-local focus maintains such a broad appeal.","A few years after the outstanding Coles Corner, former Pulp touring member continues his atmospheric, nostalgic work as a singer-songwriter.

Live From Home,Shudder to Think,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64313d1975652139140/1:1/w_160/d53f2cfe.jpg,2009-09-22 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13473-live-from-home/,Team Love,"A new Polvo record. Jawbox reissues in the pipeline, and Sunny Day Real Estate reissues on the street. The just-announced Pavement reunion. The Jesus Lizard at the 2009 Pitchfork Music Festival. And now, a new Shudder to Think live record? Nineties-me is totally stoked by the resurgence of decade-old stalwarts; throw in a few more key acts from that era and we're talking a total nerdgasm. (I'm looking at you, Jawbreaker.) All of this inevitably funnels down to a Blues Traveler reunion or something, so let's enjoy it while it lasts. Based in Washington, D.C., Shudder to Think was born in the mid-1980s, a time when punk music was learning to handle shades of emotion beyond violent anger. Old dudes in combat boots will tell you that this stuff was called ""emo,"" if you can believe it. But even among emo bands, Shudder to Think were out there. They weren't confessional, unless you count lyrics like ""Poor little girl/ Screaming traffic in her hair,"" repeated neurotically in eerie falsetto, as confessional. And they seemed at least as indebted to Judy Garland and David Bowie as they were to Minor Threat and Government Issue. Shudder to Think's influences were a stretch even in the post-punk era. They pumped up their aggressively wrought art-rock with healthy portions of glam and power-pop, garnished with show tunes and opera. Nathan Larson's intricate guitar leads were both wild and delicately patterned, like cracks in glass. When they leveled out into pounding waves of riffage, Craig Wedren's voice kept the fey dementia intact. Swerving recklessly from a queasy purr to a panicky vibrato, with a head full of tantrums, he seemed to always exist in the moment just before a terrible accident. He made hissy-fits sound like air-raids, sass like a veneer concealing a robust unwellness. Few guitar-centric bands have so deftly balanced the bruising, the fragile, the anthemic, and the bizarre. This live disc, culled from a 2008 reunion tour, is a terrific showcase for the band's sickly sweet brutality, which remains fearsome. Joining Wedren and Larson, both of whom play guitar, are drummer Kevin March, who joined the band after their 1994 masterpiece Pony Express Record, bassist Jesse Krakow, and guitarist Mark Watrous (that's right, it's a tri-guitar affair). They engage in a bit of canon revision: There's nothing from their mostly forgotten debut, Curses, Spells, Voodoo, Mooses, and only one song, ""Call of the Playground"", from their mainstream-aimed final album, 50,000 B.C. (Okay, there are two if you count ""Red House"", but it was originally released on an earlier album. That Shudder to Think thought a creepy power-pop number about psychedelic drugs was a good mainstream gambit says a lot about them.) Barring those omissions, it's evenly divided between their three influential Dischord albums-- Get Your Goat, Ten Spot, and Funeral at the Movies-- and Pony Express Record, on Epic. I get that people hated 50,000 B.C.-- including, apparently, Shudder to Think and/or Team Love, who fail to mention it in the press release-- but I wouldn't have minded hearing ""The Saddest Day of My Life"". Other painful omissions, like ""Earthquakes Come Home"", ""I Blew Away/Ride That Sexy Horse"", and ""Kissi Penny"" only stress Shudder to Think's consistent excellence. Most of their songs feel essential in some way. You really couldn't ask for a much better single-disc set-list than this, which covers fan favorites like ""Shake Your Halo Down"" and ""X-French Tee Shirt"", while making a case for Shudder to Think's dynamic range, from the barreling ""Rag"" to the exquisitely gentle ""Day Ditty"". These days, Wedren's doing MOR-pop and soundtrack stuff, and Larson's doing A Camp, but they sound more inspired here than they have since... well, since they played these songs the first time. New album please.","Another in a line of 1990s stalwarts making their recent comeback, these D.C. art-rockers document their 2008 reunion tour on this live disc.

Backspacer,Pearl Jam,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63f9d034d5c69bf34bb/1:1/w_160/5161d1c3.jpg,2009-09-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13480-backspacer/,InterscopeMonkeywrench,"If you're between the ages of, say, 25 and 35, chances are you either significantly overrate or underrate Pearl Jam. Either you carry a certain nostalgist's sentiment for one of your early rock touchstones (I fall into this camp), or you view them as the root of all that was overwrought and evil about mid-to-late-90s guitar music. Sure, everyone knows PJ sold eleven trillion albums between 1991 and '94, but still I imagine it's difficult for relative young'uns to reconcile how strong an opinion so many people in a specific demographic have about a group that hasn't been commercially or critically relevant for over a decade. Backspacer, the group's ninth studio album, seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster. Virtually the whole record settles into the same formula the band's been dutifully churning out since the dawn of the millennium-- lively but almost utterly hookless riff-driven hard rock. Lather, rinse, repeat. And when I say ""riff-driven"" I really mean ""almost entirely riff-dependent,"" because musically the riffs themselves are typically the only things worth your attention. PJ's long-dormant punk and hardcore proclivities (ugh, ""Lukin"") have been rising to the surface with greater regularity in recent years, and I'll admit in short bursts this bulldozing approach can be somewhat satisfying. The opening four songs kick-start and then keep up a certain pleasing level of propulsiveness, with the goofily fast-and-loose ""Gonna See My Friend"" (hey, is that an actual bassline I hear?) and Thin Lizzy-ish double entendres of ""Johnny Guitar"" being particularly listenable. Sooner or later, however, you remember these guys wouldn't know a melody if it bit them in the ass. What's worse, this chugging blitzkrieg negates the power of the band's greatest weapon, Eddie Vedder's voice, which can display its craggy richness and masculine grace only when the band isn't trying to break land-speed records. (I know some folks hate Ed's singing, but it mostly seems like they're reacting to the fact that his voice launched a thousand Nickelbacks, which is like hating ""The Simpsons"" because of ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"".) The gentle ""Just Breathe"" might seem like the perfect opportunity for Vedder to finally dust off those resonant pipes, but instead he sings the tune with a distractingly country-ish catch in his voice, plus the tune is numbingly syrupy and the lyrics, after a promisingly pointed start (""I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love"") devolve into tedium. The same hit-or-miss sensitivity marks ""The End""-- Vedder inexplicably finds it necessary to remind us he's ""just a human being"" on one song and ""just another human being"" on the other-- but at least ""The End"" manages to land on the right side of affecting thanks to its painfully honest depiction of romantic dissolution (""This is not me/ You see/ Believe/ I'm better than this/ Don't leave""). Still, we have to rely on ""Amongst the Waves"" to deliver anything remotely resembling the soaring anthemics that used to be a PJ trademark (what I wouldn't give for a ""Light Years"" even). The back half of the album sure isn't inclined to help, largely abandoning even the modest steamrolling enjoyment of the record's initial jolt in favor of thoroughly forgettable mid-tempo dreck, save for ""Supersonic"", which nonetheless sounds like a band trying to be the Ramones minus the fun. It's an extremely odd thing to say about a band that for three or four years was the biggest rock megalith on the planet, but nowadays Pearl Jam are the very definition of anonymously workmanlike, seemingly plugging along with their heads down from one colorlessly unimaginative album to the next. Once upon a time this was a group that was on top of the world and yet still took all kinds of bizarre chances, recording shit like lengthy tape experiments and songs about bugs-- often ridiculously self-indulgent, sure, yet always surprising. Now, paradoxically, with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book.","Former ""biggest band on the planet"" continues its yeoman's work, makingÂ anonymously dependable riff-rock for those who want that sort of thing.

DIA,Amen Dunes,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6299d034d5c69bf3480/1:1/w_160/82bb6cb4.jpg,2009-09-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13476-dia/,Locust,"The fact that Damon McMahon (aka Amen Dunes) recorded DIA while holed up in a Catskills cabin is so fitting it feels like a myth. The album's claustrophobic, voice-in-head tone immediately evokes inner-space travelers like Syd Barrett, Roky Erickson, and Skip Spence. And McMahon's simple songs, fuzzy guitar, and buzzing vocals all sound like the product of some solitary brain, sitting in some isolated cabin, buried deep inside some dark forest. It's telling, though, that after he made DIA, McMahon moved to Beijing: as the album progresses, it reveals a musical vision reaching beyond the boundaries of a lonely woods. Early on, his stylistic umbrella expands to let in a Suicide/Spacemen 3 loop, the eerie howls of early Royal Trux, and the post-Barrett folk of Robyn Hitchcock. But his farthest-flung and strongest reference point proves to be the underground sounds of 1980s New Zealand. As McMahon's tunes sharpen and deepen, he becomes like an American cousin to Kiwi songsmiths Alastair Galbraith, Chris Knox, and brothers Graeme and Peter Jefferies. The key to how McMahon can evoke those greats and still bring some of himself to the mix is his voice. On the surface his singing sounds raw and monotone, pitched in a droning hum and distorted at the edges. But listen closely and you can hear subtle changes that give DIA a surprising diversity. On ""White Lace"", his singing rises sharply, pulling his guitar along with it. He alternates tough moans and eerie falsettos in the Barrett-ish ""Castles"", and ghosts of Knox and Galbraith emerge via his openly earnest croons in ""No Shot"". By album's end, McMahon's meditative hums are practically all that's left, like shells on a beaten shore glistening in the sunset. ""Glisten"" is a relative term here-- overall, DIA is still a rather constricted album, with a tonal range that's pretty narrow despite how much McMahon mines from it. But the record does hold indications of how wide his sound could become, particularly the perfectly-crafted bit of psych-folk called ""Two Thousand Islands"" that pops up near album's end. Here, his modest voice melds beautifully into some clucking, Velvet Underground-ish guitar. That alone is enough to make you look forward to what McMahon comes up with next, perched above a temple in Beijing rather than tucked away in a Northeastern woodland.","Damon McMahon's Locust release recalls otherÂ claustrophobic,Â inner-space travelers like Syd Barrett, Roky Erickson, and Skip Spence.

Crayon Angel: A Tribute to the Music of Judee Sill,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61ab1335d7bf1698d58/1:1/w_160/efb0acd9.jpg,2009-09-21 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13459-crayon-angel-a-tribute-to-the-music-of-judee-sill/,American Dust,"There are cult artists, and then there are cult artists. Judee Sill is a little of both. In one sense of the word, she remains an obscure singer-songwriter with only a passing familiarity with the mainstream (she wrote ""Lady-O"", a hit for the Turtles) but with an avid audience devoted to tracking down every note she recorded. In the other sense of the word, Sill's songs have many of the trappings of an upstart California cult: astral planes, heavenly spaceships, apocalypse, and a unique understanding of a certain crossmaker. By today's standards, it can sound a bit loopy, but also much more benevolent than other cults and cult artists. Hers is a distinctly compassionate worldview, which seems natural given that music served as an escape from the harsh burdens of her reality: broken family, heroin addiction, health problems, stalled career, and an early death. Perhaps that explains why fans are often so protective of Sill's legacy and also why this new tribute album often sounds so noncommittal. Her complex songs-- which typically emphasize swooping melodic lines and eschew choruses-- demand complete devotion from listeners and performers, and only a handful of these fifteen artists give themselves over so completely to the material. Ron Sexsmith and P.G. Six open and close the compilation with pretty but mundane versions of ""Crayon Angel"" and ""'Til Dreams Come True"", respectively, and in between the Bye Bye Blackbirds reimagine ""There's a Rugged Road"" as a Gram Parsons lament, which isn't that much of a re-imagining. Meg Baird doesn't have the vocal presence to convey the melody on ""When the Bridegroom Comes""; she gets lost in the song. And then Marissa Nadler ignores melody altogether. Accompanied by Black Hole Infinity, her dark, cramped take on ""The Kiss"" favors dull trip-hop atmosphere and a breathless delivery, but feels neither erotic nor celebratory, just grayly downcast and overlong. For fans, this collection will be of special interest for including two recently discovered compositions that Sill never recorded. ""Reach for the Sky"" turns the hold-up line into a spiritual imperative, but it makes more sense-- at least autobiographically-- as a Sill tune than as a Beth Orton tune, where the message sounds obligatory rather than felt. Bill Callahan's carefully, patiently, glacially paced ""For a Rainbow"" shuffles along for eight long minutes. He doesn't always hold your attention, but his efforts toward eccentricity are appreciated. The best moments on Crayon Angel are created by the truest believers, whose own idiosyncrasies compete with Sill's. Final Fantasy arranges ""The Donor"" as a variegated pattern of keyboard lines, reducing the tune to 1s and 0s and finding a liturgical melody at its heart. Similarly, Nicolai Dunger's ""Solder of the Heart"" shouldn't work but does; his performance, which combines the vocal mannerisms of an earthier Jeff Buckley and the accompaniment of a Sunday afternoon piano lesson, sounds both refreshingly unrehearsed and evocatively over-the-top. Daniel Rossen resurrects the demo ""Waterfall"" and fills it out nicely, and Princeton not only samples Sill's live introduction to ""Down Where the Valleys Are Low"", but recasts the song as a short, sweet hymn full of oddball percussion, mewing keyboards, and distracted vocals. But the real gem here-- the reason to visit and revisit this collection-- is Frida HyvÃ¶nen's ""Jesus Was a Crossmaker"", a lovely, lonely gospel number that features the Swedish singer-songwriter layering her vocals into a celestial choir and unearthing new veins of meaning in the ambiguously scriptural lyrics. More than any other artist on Crayon Angel, HyvÃ¶nen understands Sill's intentions and appeal, and this cover sounds positively inevitable, as if Sill hadÂ prophesiedÂ it years ago.","Cult folk artist Judee Sill gets a tribute with contributions from Bill Callahan, Grizzly Bear's Daniel Rossen, Beth Orton, Marissa Nadler, and more.

Two Sunsets,The PastelsTenniscoats,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6119d034d5c69bf344b/1:1/w_160/ead5e203.jpg,2009-09-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13463-two-sunsets/,Domino,"Longevity is the Pastels' strong suit; productivity isn't-- they've existed more or less continuously since their 1982 debut single, but aside from a remix disc and a soundtrack, this is the first album that's escaped from them in 12 years. This isn't quite a full-on Pastels album, either: it's a collaboration with the Japanese duo Tenniscoats, who were the ones who had the idea for the collaboration. (The Pastels apparently have an album of their own in the works, too, although it's been coming along very slowly for a while.) In the 90s, the Pastels were smart enough to realizing that becoming subcultural icons-- champions of C86! poster children of wide-eyed amateurist innocent indie-shabby-chic!-- meant that they had to change what they did or risk being trapped in their adolescence forever. So they slowed way down and hazed way up on 1995's Mobile Safari and 1997's Illumination, shifting their focus from pop thrills to blurry mindfulness exercises. The version of the band that turns up here (for longtime Pastels-watchers, they seem currently to be reduced to a duo of Stephen McRobbie and Katrina Mitchell) has gone even further down that path: the tempos here are so slow and the arrangements so spare that every note seems like a tentative step into too-bright daylight. The only hint of the Pastels of two decades ago actually comes from ""Sodane"", one of the Tenniscoats-directed songs-- there's a rare hint of urgency to its rhythm and a suggestion of Sittin' Pretty to its one-finger lead guitar part. Fortunately, Tenniscoats' aesthetic here mostly has more to do with with the Pastels as they are than as they were back in the days when a Pastels badge was the sign of membership in an indie-pop sodality-- it's hard to tell which instrumental details come from which band, and Tenniscoats vocalist Saya's singing owes something to Mitchell's. (The fragment of melody that provides the hook of ""Yomigaeru"" involves a very Pastels-like stretch for notes that are probably somewhere in the vicinity of where Saya actually lands.) Sometimes, the result is as frail and lovely as worn lace; sometimes it's just threadbare. The danger of inter-band collaborations is that nobody takes responsibility for the project, and the track list here has been bumped up to a dozen with the help of a couple of half-formed instrumentals (""Modesty Piece"" is an intro in search of a song that never quite gets there) and a pretty but relatively by-the-numbers cover of ""About You"" by the Pastels' Glasgow homies the Jesus and Mary Chain. When Two Sunsets gels, though, its foggy shimmer is intermittently lovely. ""Vivid Youth"" isn't much more than a subtle guitar riff, Mitchell singing like she's just woken up and is still lying on something soft next to someone she likes a lot, and an off-the-cuff clarinet solo, but as textural songs go, it's warm, fluffy and fragrant. And the one song that actually sounds like both bands wrote it together is one of the album's highlights: ""Song for a Friend"", on which McRobbie, Mitchell and Saya exchange English and Japanese lyrics as if they're stepping up, one by one, to voice memories of a time that they understand better now than they did when it was happening.","Scottish indie pop legends team withÂ Japanese duo Tenniscoats to record their first non-soundtrack studio album in 12 years.

Central Market,Tyondai Braxton,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a626ea9e61561daa52e1/1:1/w_160/a1c55e7f.jpeg,2009-09-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13472-central-market/,Warp,"Tyondai Braxton has been making music, patiently and maybe a bit pensively, in New York for most of the past decade, both in the ecstatic prog-rock band Battles and as an occasional loop-mining solo artist who can summon the sound of several bands over. None of his music has been small, and none of it has lacked for promise. But none of it even began to foretell the scale and sweep ofÂ Central Market. Central Market is a big album for an age that has acquainted itself with thinking small about the album both as a vessel for sound and as a standard-bearer for new aesthetic vision. It's big in the sense that it's orchestral-- made in part with the Wordless Music Orchestra, a rangy New York ensemble proficient with everything from strings and xylophones to flutes and kazoos. ButÂ Central Market proves bigger in the sense that it's clearly been delivered as a statement record-- a summation of lots of ideas accrued over the years and lots of restless thinking about how best to engage those ideas in ways far from expected. Braxton came up around the start of the 2000s in the same underground folds that fostered Black Dice and Animal Collective. He wrote music that shared certain rustle-y, ritualistic traits with the early work of both, but Braxton was also more expressive from the start. Especially at startling (and all too rare) live shows that would find him sitting solo on a floor with a mess of effects and a microphone, he would layer loops upon loops of guitar sounds with vocals that he would bellow-- like some strange fusion of formless noise-music with the pent-up goth squirm of Morrissey or Robert Smith. Vocals of the sort don't wander often intoÂ Central Market, but the emotive tilt of them figures into arrangements that address many shades of meaning and mood. ""Opening Bell"" begins it all with an expectant piano trill that builds as it couples with gamely whistling, dark electric guitar, and golden horns, all before spreading into a bright fantasia of strings played within the deep space of the most accomplished classical music. Braxton has a conservatory background and, maybe more importantly, a well-thumbed copy of The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century. Indeed, echoes of that book-- a suggestive survey of modern classical music by storied New Yorker critic Alex Ross-- linger in scores that evoke the studiousness and sonic spread of composers like Igor Stravinsky, Olivier Messiaen, GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti, and many others who addressed both the state of the world and the very idea of ""music"" at its semiotic core. Not that stoking seriousness isÂ Central Market's sole province. Some of the barely recognizable vocalese in tracks like ""Uffe's Woodshop"" plays like the kind of almost goofy voice-pitch games that Braxton has played in Battles, a band he's helped rescue from what could otherwise be a mere triumph of rock technicians. And the ways that slide whistles and kazoos dance around portentous guitar in a track like ""The Duck and the Butcher"" make much of their sourcing from, well, slide whistles and kazoos. Some of the album is experimental and sly, but most ofÂ Central Market is searchingly big and magnanimous. The centerpiece, ""Platinum Rows"", flits through stately reserve and composed chaos over 10-plus minutes, given to deep drama and comic celebration that thrive as both for not really showing their cards as either. And as the mood constricts and descends into darkness toward the end-- especially in the guitar/vocal-based ""J. City"", the only song that could be classed as rock at all-- Braxton stumps well for an internal logic at play from the beginning. How that logic manifests itself throughout can prove stunning at times and a bit scattered at others-- but it's always, in ways that count as an important achievement in the end, a galvanizing surprise.","In his first post-Mirrored release, the Battles leader enlists the Wordless Music Orchestra to craft a record of ambitious modern classical music.

Rain Machine,Rain Machine,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62b5e6ef95969320c85/1:1/w_160/5001064a.jpg,2009-09-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13479-rain-machine/,Anti-,"TV on the Radio guitarist/singer Kyp Malone devised the moniker Rain Machine for his solo endeavors because he didn't like the way his actual name looked on show bills and record sleeves. Given that TVOTR has previously collaborated with David Bowie and clearly draws significant inspiration from the Thin White Duke's work, it's not much of a leap to hear the name ""Rain Machine"" and think, worryingly, of ""Tin Machine,"" the rock-punchline group Bowie put together in 1988 to make a couple of records that were critically reviled and almost immediately forgotten. Malone should certainly avoid that fate here-- while the late 80s found Bowie's reputation in freefall, TVOTR is arguably at present the mostÂ fÃªted band in America. Still, the two projects share an overall thrust common to so many sidelight efforts, namely a willingness to subvert expectations and pursue indulgences, to explore rabbit holes that might never have been fully penetrated without the protective cover of a new sobriquet. These divergences aren't immediately revealed, as Rain Machine opens in close proximity to TVOTR's wheelhouse: ""Give Blood"" boasts ragged riffs, an ample bottom end and pleasingly batty vocals, simmering and smoldering like so much of that band's catalogue. However, ""New Last Name"" finds Malone beginning to veer off the beaten path thanks to its meditative bent and lovely guitar filigree, and it's a delicate avenue he also tiptoes down on the folky, sleigh bell-adorned ""Driftwood Heart"" as well the jarringly lovely fingerpicked outro to ""Hold You Holy"". Even amidst these gentle, atmospheric detours, the album's first half doesn't lack for kinetic drama. Pre-outro, ""Hold You Holy"" is Rain Machine's most explosive moment, an exultant call of desire and celebration heralded by guitar pyrotechnics. Similarly vigorous, though far more grave, is ""Smiling Black Faces"", which starts off with horrific imagery worthy of Cormac McCarthy (""Bodies strung like tanning hides/ Oh, and the fly-covered babies"") and evolves into a thoroughly riveting, cathartic sermon on race that touches specifically on the tragic murder of Sean Bell, providing a sorely necessary treatment of themes typically ignored in the lily-white indie-rock community. Unfortunately, Malone allows his muse to send him entirely too far afield over the second half of the album, where his art-damaged insularity ossifies into pure self-indulgent torpor. No one will ever mistake TV on the Radio for tight-fisted, two-and-a-half-minute popsmiths, but three of Rain Machine's final six tracks run eight minutes or longer, and we're not talking about danceable funk workouts here either. ""Desperate Bitch"" and its immediate successor, ""Love Won't Save You"", both lean too heavily on lyrical transgressiveness (sixteen straight minutes of turning tricks, ""castration fear,"" cocks, pussies, pimps and hoes only works when Lou Reed's doing it), but at least the former offers sturdy bass and a fair approximation of Sonic Youth at its most ruminative, while the latter is 476 seconds of savagely strummed guitar and aimlessly plangent pining that Jason Molina would probably find too starkly meandering. And I don't really even know what to say about ""Winter Song"", except that there oughta be a law against releasing an 11-minute song that does include the word ""antediluvian"" but doesn't include an actual freaking groove. Even the surrounding back-half tracks that aren't marathons and are far more listenable for that fact still don't carry much juice. This damning lack of momentum is a real shame considering Malone is such a gifted, expressive, wide-ranging vocalist, a frequently lovely and fluid guitarist, and generally an interestingly vivid lyricist. Almost all of his tangents are worthy of being followed-- I only wish he'd shed a little more light from time to time to help the rest of us trace his steps.","TV on the Radio guitarist/singer Kyp MaloneÂ subverts expectations on this solo project, creating both gentle, atmospheric detours and kinetic drama.

What better way to emerge into the light than with unapologetically derivative 80s synth-pop that features hysterically expressive vocals and sharp songwriting? Meet La Roux. In the UK La Roux is already a household name, boasting #1 and #2 singles to go along with a #2 peak placement for the group's eponymous debut album, which finally gets its U.S. release on September 29. A duo consisting of out-of-the-spotlight co-producer Ben Langmaid and very-front-and-center vocalist Elly Jackson (daughter of famed British TV actress Trudie Goodwin), La Roux delivers icy but irresistible throwback pop that hearkens back explicitly to fellow femme-led Brits Yazoo and the Eurhythmics. As far as contemporary comparisons are concerned, La Roux seems almost to have chosen its moniker as a means to ensure their record store placards would be slotted in the same alphabetical neighborhood as most of their RIYLs-- Little Boots, Lady Gaga, and Ladyhawke are all nearby taxonomically and sonically. The album starts with ""In for the Kill"", which besides inspiring an excellent remix from Skream is also pretty emblematic of the record as a whole, as its key elements-- plinky synths, hollow beats, ecstatic vocals-- pop up again and again, particularly on ""Quicksand"" and ""Fascination"". Jackson's demonstrative vocals are inevitably going to be a sticking point for some people, but unless you want all your ladies to sound like Lykke Li then hopefully you can stomach La Roux's bountiful affect. The best thing on here by far is ""Bulletproof"", a declaration of emotional steeliness containing an utterly irresistible sing-along chorus, and if you could level an instant criticism at the rest of the album it's that it lacks more truly indelible moments like this one. The flip side of the coin is that there isn't a single duffer on the whole record, as each song offers its own spot of fun even if it fails to deliver a hook that demands to be shouted from rooftops. ""Tigerlily"" features a vaguely creepy, Vincent Price-ish spoken word bit that's just bizarre enough to work, and then seemingly to answer it, ""Reflections are Protection"" whips out a rubbery, creeping synth line that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Thriller. Jackson and Langmaid even showcase a solid knack for balladry, which accounts for most of the admittedly minor emotional resonance of an album that primarily recycles lyrical themes of spurned, illicit and obsessive love. The pulsing synths, clattery beats and vocal histrionics of ""Armour Love""Â don't stray terribly far from the group's wheelhouse, but ""Cover My Eyes"" is a real revelation, featuring a chillingly deadened vocal turn from Jackson and a miraculously non-ridiculous assist from the London Community Gospel Choir. It's a promising sign La Roux might actually develop some range as this pilfer-pop duo continues to mature.","This record ofÂ unapologetically derivative 80s synth-pop is already a sensation in the UK, boasting a pair of hit singles.

Keep an Eye on the Sky,Big Star,by: Stephen M.

Like Magellan, they discovered a new route to iconic status, but theirs was more circuitous and didn't involve such niceties as sales, audience, tours, or really anything resembling actual success. Instead, they maintained a slow, dim burn throughout the 1970s and 80s, their memory kept alive by critics, collectors, record store clerks, and younger generations of musicians such as R.E.M. and the Replacements. It's easy to read that history in the band name and album titles, which today play like ironic gestures toward out-of-reach celebrity. But Big Star were sincere about being big stars and having #1 records. They didn't set out to be cult: Striving for celebrity and confirmation, they wrote what they thought should be hit records, and they played to please. Their appeal should and could have been broad. By comparison, their loyal audience nearly forty years later is a fluke. Despite their unprecedented longevity and surprising durability, Big Star have been under-anthologized, with a strange string of lackluster releases. Alex Chilton's pre-band solo debut, 1970, took more than 15 years to make its way to record store shelves, and the band's first two albums, #1 Record and Radio City, have been joined at the hip now for decades, starting with the British combo release in 1978 throughout Fantasy/Concord's recent remaster. Big Star's final album, Third/Sisters Lovers, gathered dust for nearly five years before finally getting a small release, and even that tribute album was delayed for nearly a decade. During that time, The Best of Big Star and Big Star Story tried foolishly to whittle the band's short career down to one negligible disc. Combining studio tracks, live cuts, demos, and unreleased recordings to reveal new sides of the band, Rhino' 4xCD Keep an Eye on the Sky sounds like the one reissue that finally gets Big Star right. It picks up right before the band formed, with solo tracks from both Chris Bell and Chilton as well as songs from previous bands Rock City and Icewater (the Box Tops are missing, and certainly not necessary to the story). Each iteration of the line-up is represented here, although there's nothing from 1993's comeback Columbia: Live at Missouri University or from 2005's already forgotten In Space. This set wisely keeps its eye on the 70s. These four discs ultimately do what any good box set should do: In tracing the band's trajectory from power-pop progenitors to post-pop tinkerers, Keep an Eye on the Sky presents a history of the band that could not be gleaned from the albums themselves, using finished studio tracks along with demos and rarities to give a fuller picture of the musicians, their dynamic, and their songs. This type of repetition can be fatal in some reissues, either offering distinctions only a true diehard could love or valiantly covering up a deficit of unreleased material. But here, the approach goes a long way toward humanizing a band that has been largely mythologized even into the Internet age. You can listen in on band practice or late-night jam sessions at Ardent, or just wander across happenstance pairings, such as Chilton singing ""Nature Boy"" while William Eggleston-- yes, that William Eggleston-- plays piano. That these new versions of familiar songs feed the cult rather than expunge the mystery is perhaps due to Ardent founder and engineer John Fry, whose studio work brings out the subtle flourishes in these different takes: the handclaps on the sped-up version of ""O My Soul"", the rich strums that underline the chorus of ""The Ballad of El Goodo"", the crisp guitar sound that gives ""You Get What You Deserve"" its bite. He's the fifth Big Star, as crucial to these early recordings as George Martin was to the Beatles or Martin Hannett was to Joy Division. Big Star developed its particular sound in a very short time. The first notes of ""Feel"", the #1 Record opener, still sound like a clarion call, a signal that something exciting is about to go down. They live up to that promise through their first two albums, but on their third, with Bell and bass player Andy Hummel gone, Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens gradually disassemble that power-pop sound, seemingly indulging every oddball impulse: jive-talking through ""You Can't Have Me"" and ""Kizza Me"", adding French-language backing vocals to the Velvet Underground's ""Femme Fatale"", writing a paean to Jesus Christ. Third and its outtakes show Big Star in its death throes, giving up on the idea of power pop to the people and just making strange, sad, beautiful songs for themselves. ""Holocaust"" in particular, especially the haunting piano demo here, is devastating in its damaged beauty. Keep an Eye on the Sky ends with a cuts from three concerts recorded at a small Memphis club in 1973, featuring the original line-up minus Bell. They run through songs from the first two albums, including jammy performances of ""She's a Mover"" and ""Don't Lie to Me"" as well as covers of T. Rex, the Kinks, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Todd Rundgren. It's a strong show, a better glimpse at Big Star the live band than any of their actual live albums, but what stands out is the relative lack of audience response. Big Star were opening for Archie Bell & the Drells, and it's clear that the crowd was already impatient with the first act. As a result, it sounds like Big Star are playing to an empty room, which feels thematically appropriate. People wouldn't start clapping until many years later.","Combining studio tracks, live cuts, demos, and unreleased recordings, Rhino' 4xCD compilation isÂ the reissue that finally gets Big Star right.

Time to Die,The Dodos,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6089d034d5c69bf3437/1:1/w_160/ef93444f.jpg,2009-09-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13446-time-to-die/,Frenchkiss,"You could argue the wisdom of using something called ""Fools"" to sell a watery macrobrew, but when the Dodos' breakthrough song was used in a Miller Chill commercial, it went a long way towards illustrating what made its parent album Visiter such a treat-- Meric Long and Logan Kroeber kept a foot in the avant-garde with their astounding technical chops and an unvarnished recording of string buzz, drum rattle, and missed cues, all while keeping things grounded in a user-friendly acoustic pop format. At times, I wondered if I overrated it, but these days, I think it might be underrated-- if I told you Animal Collective-inspired music could be used to sell beer, what chance would you give it to turn out as good as the charmingly undecided Visiter? Changes are afoot for this prototypical duo: Yet electric vibraphonist/percussionist Keaton Snyder isn't even the most noticeable addition to the fold on Time to Die-- producer Phil Ek is. and if you're thinking that Time to Die has a suspiciously similar sound to the Shins' Chutes Too Narrow or Fleet Foxes, now you know why. Look, Ek's call is one you gotta take if you're looking to make a leap to a new echelon of indie-fame, and the decisiveness of the album can be admirable when so many other quick turnarounds result in more of the same or guessing against a band's strengths. But while the Shins' James Mercer and Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold often use their backing bands as vehicles for vocals, but they don't have the Dodos' rhythmic force and this presentation initially plays like a misallocation of resources. Not that Long is a poor singer, far from it-- his voice remains convincingly boyish, even at its most cynical and he never loses control of his range. But as a wordsmith, he can be distractingly dodgy-- see: the anti-establishment sentiments of ""Two Medicines"" and ""The Strums"", too generic to have real bite despite featuring the record's most intriguing structure and a ingratiating, swooping chorus, respectively. Opener ""Small Deaths"" begins with Long alone on guitar and vocals, and while that was the dominant sound on Visiter, there's a distinct makeover in presentation: His acoustic is more rounded, almost spongy, his voice coated with a warm, thin glaze of reverb. And then the drums come in-- Visiter crackled with the intensity of two monstrously talented musicians competing for the lead role (acoustic Lightning Bolt too much of a stretch?), but initially, it's ""no, you go first."" Over the wide-open chords at the start of ""The Strums"" you can practically hear a voiceover boasting ""a new romantic comedy from the director who brought you..."" ""This Is a Business"" bears more than a passing similarity to the ramshackle rumble of ""Jodi"", but it doesn't achieve the same frenetic lift-off. I've seen most of Time to Die performed live, and through that, answered the one question you'll probably have: Absolutely, these songs would sound much better if the drums were turned up. All that said, the Dodos' charms are too strong to be held hostage by a bigger budget, even if you wonder what a guy like Brian Deck could do with it. If ""Small Deaths"" initially comes off as too tastefully restrained, it's only because the Dodos are allowing space between themselves and their most conventionally ""epic"" climax, a steady drum guiding as guitar and vibes steadily pace themselves in adding subtle fuzz tones. Likewise, early leak ""Fables"" may have sounded wanting for energy, but Kroeber shows a knack for a subtly ingratiating swing that emphasizes the Dodos' rhythmic gifts. As Time to Die progresses, you slowly hear the Dodos growing more comfortable in their tonier territory. ""Troll Nacht"" is quite possibly the most gorgeous Dodos composition to date, an endearing and tender vocal performance by Long fitting its ease-into-Autumn glow, while the title track ends the record on a bobbing, bluesy note recalling their more Zeppelin III-inspired moments while incorporating a newfound look to harmonizing vocal loops. So you really can't call Time to Die a disappointment, not when it actually improves on Visiter in some ways. It's not the full-out leap into ""pop"" that it would initially seem (for that, you'd need to hear the difference between Visiter and their self-released full-length, from back when they were called Dodo Bird), and for all its charms, Visiter wasn't exactly the tightest hour going. Time to Die bests it as far as consistency goes-- might not get a ""Fools"" here, but you won't get a ""Park Song"" either. And it's hard to envision Time to Die slowing the momentum of the Dodos' ascendance, not when their live performances are still thrilling as ever, but Time to Die comes off like a temporary decision to forgo made them lovable, flaws and all, and stress what makes them likeable.","Like many ambitious indie bands before them, the Dodos enlist producer Phil Ek to help craft their rise to indie fame.

Kamaal the Abstract,Q-Tip,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a628ea9e61561daa52e6/1:1/w_160/fad80481.jpeg,2009-09-18 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13471-kamaal-the-abstract/,Jive,"Kamaal the Abstract is not a great record by any means. But it is an interesting one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh two disparate musical systems, gambling that inherent internal friction could spark some excitement. Unfortunately, the road to 6.3 is paved with experimental intentions. Kamaal the Abstract first leaked at the beginning of the decade, the follow-up to Tip's solo debut Amplified. While the status of the latter record has only grown in the ensuing years, thanks largely to Dilla's rise as a cult production hero, Kamaal's nature as an experimental cul-de-sac feels more cemented with time. But the ink never dries in the history books; if anything, the 2000s may have finally given Kamaal and Kamaal an opportunity for creative redemption. The collision of jazz and hip-hop, of course, isn't a new concept, especially for an artist who worked with Ron Carter on Tribe's second LP. But with Tribe, never mind Digable Planets, Guru, or US3, incorporating jazz often felt like more of a stylistic affect than concrete engagement, just a couple of looped bars and a brief instrumental solo from a big name on a track outro. Since bebop revolutionized jazz in the 1940s, attempts to integrate the genre with pop forms have been risky. Tip's pops used to say hip-hop reminded him of bebop for a reason; at their best, jazz and rap both feature interconnected conversations and content being generated over a short time in their parallel worlds. But rap music's complexity is tied up in language, the melodic and harmonic aspects stripped down so as to focus the listener on the verbal. Post-bebop jazz usually hinges on harmonic complexity. Kamaal the Abstract, to its great credit, is unafraid of (messily) combining these values. Tip seems to have focused primarily on jazz's harmonic intricacies, evident on opener ""Feelin'"" or ""A Million Times"", which are unafraid to eschew pop song structure to get at the meat of what makes post-swing jazz harmonically interesting. But sometimes this nuanced backdrop sounds an off-note for the subject matter; while a bunch of ideas were going on in any Tribe-era Q-Tip verse, Tip's redundant boilerplate womanizing over Steely Dan-style chord changes on ""Heels"" just doesn't fit. Even worse, Tip's singing throughout the record -- a shallow signifier for this more ""soulful"" approach, perhaps? -- feels unnecessarily cautious. Very Andre 3k. But jazz gets shortchanged, too. For the most part, the solos feel safe and not particularly notable. Guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel's presence followed the release of an exciting, adventurous solo LP The Next Step, so it's confusing to hear his cameo reduced to rhythm guitar on the extended, platitudinous jam ""Do You Dig U?"". Even the incredible Kenny Garrett, who does get an extended solo feature on the stop-start funk âAbstractionisms,â seems to be holding back. It feels like the soloists were so conscious of the album's pop music concessions, they felt they had to dumb it down, afraid to cut loose, as if they were recording for âThe Late Showâ or a random studio session. Despite Tip's willingness to combine the stylistic approaches of jazz and hip-hop, many songs feel imbalanced this way, with potentially exciting material undercut by underwhelming performances or half-finished ideas. It is worth recognizing that the Miles and Mizells of the world were extraordinarily rare. Few artists could perfectly balance of jazz's intricate complexity as a live performance with lightning-in-a-bottle pop perfection as a piece of recorded art. Which is why ""Even If It Is So"" is such an accomplishment. With a simple repeated piano vamp over acoustic guitar, the song features the rapper riffing compassionately about single motherhood alongside a memorable horn hook. The music perfectly reflects the song's theme of subdued respect, the incredible beauty of strength in the most harrowing situations. It also leaves you wanting more, the kind of song you'd love to hear extended and embellished, perhaps in a live setting. Which is the key to this record's possibility; each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise. There's been a lot of talk about the growing importance of the live show to artists in the RapidShare era. While Kamaal isn't the brave, experimental success it wants to be, it doesn't exactly feel like the cul-de-sac it once did. It suggests a promising future, where the world of live shows offers Q-Tip and these soloists a chance to stretch out, while recalling their roots in entertainment, which isn't so evident here.","Q-Tip's long-delayed experimental album, cut at the beginning of the decade with contributions from jazz musicians, is finally given a proper release.

The Visitor,Jim OâRourke,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6235e6ef95969320c75/1:1/w_160/471d7de2.jpg,2009-09-18 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13468-the-visitor/,Drag City,"Pardon the archaic suggestion, but if you've opened a physical copy of Jim O'Rourke's return to glory, The Visitor, you'll understand that it's a demanding release even before you've heard its introductory trace of acoustic guitar. Indeed, if you're legally listening to your own edition of The Visitor, then you're holding either a compact disc or an LP. Whether for reasons of sound quality, tradition, or both, O'Rourke and Drag City forewent an mp3 release of his new album. You have to, like, pick it up. And inside, on the minimal liner notes, O'Rourke makes his second demand: ""Please listen on speakers, loud,"" he entreats, as if now recording under the name Jimm O))). In the end, these prerequisites presage The Visitor, a unified 38-minute instrumental piece that plays hide-and-go-seek with dozens of instruments, textures, and motifs before refusing to deliver the climax you might have expected. An arrogant pop record, The Visitor's intricate, long-form composition rewards repeated close listens through its own insistence on subtlety and craft. Calling The Visitor a pop record is as much of a stretch as it is a reduction, but it's an important distinction to make here. Despite his involvement with well over 100 albums in the past two decades, The Visitor is just the fifth in a string of highly accessible if equally nuanced O'Rourke releases on Drag City. That series began in 1997 with the rustic instrumental Bad Timing and, until now, ended with 2001's rock opus, Insignificance. Along with Eureka and the EP Halfway to a Threeway, that quartet offered listeners easier inroads to O'Rourke, especially relative to his noise or improvised output, the textural radiance of Gastr del Sol or the kitchen-sink compositions of Brise-Glace. But they weren't your average pop records, either: Bad Timing twisted parochial roots music ideas into a gorgeous four-track cycle, while Halfway to a Threeway paired instrumental elegance and emotional ruefulness in four nearly clinical tunes. Throughout, O'Rourke moved just as deliberately as he'd later move on the long-form laptop record, I'm Happy and I'm Singing and a 1, 2, 3, 4, or with drone masters Tony Conrad and Faust on Outside the Dream Syndicate Alive. Bad Timing, for instance, built for nearly 40 minutes before horns and steel guitar ricocheted against each other like pinballs. And on the wry Insignificance, he'd often open a stanza with a happy sentiment just to present the blade beneath the cloth as conclusion. With O'Rourke, patience is more necessity than virtue. On The Visitor, it is an absolute. Offering a play-by-play guide to The Visitor, an album that O'Rourke says required over 200 separate recorded parts, would be tedious at best, but a few qualities deserve notice: The Visitor feels polite and dainty, perhaps to a fault. Much of its music, all made by O'Rourke alone in Tokyo, isn't unique or overly complicated, in that one could easily find a guitarist, organist, drummer, banjo picker, and guitarist to play the bulk of this album as a band. As with most of O'Rourke's pop output, you could imagine these ideas on any stock singer-songwriter or Sunday afternoon jazz record. In that way, though, The Visitor is a perfect gestalt, where the connections between the elements and their sum are more important than any one instant. O'Rourke links the melodies across instruments, letting a piano mirror a guitar, adjusting one slightly either by changing its meter or letting it slip away from the melody and into the next variation. Such shifts pull the whole into the next phase, maintaining nothing if not constant motion. Rather than sudden payoffs, The Visitor favors careful, minute shifts that amass over its runtime. To that end, there's no big, terminal peak. Sure, the second half springs forward with a bouncy banjo lick, and the drums, pedal steel and piano dance around each other near the track's end. But, true to its name, as soon as The Visitor begins to lean too heavily toward cerebral textures or more visceral moments, it quickly pushes in the other direction. When the action rises, know that there's always something subdued one groove over. Such a plan works because, from the acoustic guitars that mix O'Rourke's heroes Derek Bailey and John Fahey to the bright electric guitar leads that suggest Electric Light Orchestra or the Doobie Brothers, every moment here is pristinely recorded and carefully mixed. As with Joanna Newsom's Ys and Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, two masterpieces O'Rourke mixed this decade, each layer sits in its perfectly defined space. Each gesture rings clearly. But these parts are written so that they blend across those spaces, in effect creating a collage without seams. We hear every sound, but we never hear them without the benefit of their accompaniment. Given its patient development and refusal to climax, The Visitor runs the risk of being labeled boring and bland. Given its use of common instruments and techniques (a cymbal scraped with a drumstick constitutes the album's most ""out"" sound), it runs a high risk of being labeled pedestrian, too, as if O'Rourke has taken all of his experimental tendencies and finally reduced them into an adult-contemporary instrumental. Ultimately, that's about as silly as it sounds: The Visitor is a defiant record in both sound and spirit. The reluctance of O'Rourke and Drag City to release The Visitor as a digital download, for instance, rebels against our need for instant gratification. You have to work a bit to hear it. Symbolically, it's a potent act for such an anticipated release, even if bit torrents, RapidShare, and the ilk mean it's little more than a symbol. And O'Rourke's request that you listen out loud, loudly, means that you give it your attention, that you let it fill the room with sound. After all, this is soft music-- and graceful and complicated and rich, too. While it might sound polite, though, it's not to be heard passively during your morning walk to work. That's because, in the end, The Visitor is a one-man show that refuses to be selfish. It eschews spotlight moments and elides our need to be greedy, to be fed captivation. After a decade of bands exclaiming it all in five minutes (The Arcade Fire, MGMT, this list never stops) and a season of bands getting Internet famous with 40 minutes of output where the tape hiss is to my ears more interesting than the songs (Wavves, Vivian Girls, will this list stop soon?), it's redeeming to hear something deliver such development and depth. These 38 meticulously prepared minutes offer dozens of memorable moments. They just demand that you listen.","After years of foregoing recorded music for other pursuits, Jim O'Rourke makes a brilliant return with a subtly complex 38-minute piece of orchestral pop.

Black Telephone of Matter,Mika Vainio,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6195e6ef95969320c64/1:1/w_160/fd6cdf12.jpg,2009-09-17 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13458-black-telephone-of-matter/,Touch,"I didn't think I'd hear a scarier record than Kreng's L'autopsie PhÃ©nomÃ©nale De Dieu in 2009. But then came Mika Vainio's Black Telephone of Matter. Kreng sounds positively sweet by comparison. Vainio's tailored noise is deeply fissured, unforgivingly ambiguous, and almost entirely devoid of the kind of cues that help us read sound as music. He doesn't mix in any creepy strings or detuned pianos to humanize his compositions, and he locates more feeling in near-silence than high volume, which makes him distinct from harsh-noise mavens. Only a few sounds on the album-- some mangled bird calls, a scattering of cymbals, hints of deconstructed death-metal on ""Swedenborgia""-- are mimetic. All else is seething, oozing electricity. It's a pitch-black world where blown-out machines mutter to each other. As a member of Pan Sonic, a Finnish group that mines a ragged seam between minimal techno, industrial, and power electronics, Vainio (now based in Berlin) is no stranger to dire, confrontational music. Pan Sonic is known for blurring the line between the sonic and the physical. In 1995, they performed in a car park in London with a sound system rigged up on an armored car (designed by the KLF's Jimmy Cauty), similar to what riot squads use, in pursuit of the infamous brown note. One pre-Pan Sonic performance by Vainio found him locked in a room for ten hours with a low-frequency drone at 125 decibels. He's a process-guy with a bottomless fascination for how sound interacts with the whole body, not just the ears and mind. Even in Vainio's various solo work (as Ã, Philus, and under his own name), there's usually at least the intimation of a beat, but Black Telephone of Matter is guided solely by extremes of frequency, volume, and stereo space. ""Roma A.D. 2727"" scans like a poltergeist radio, shuffling through piercingly textured machine noises that divulge moments of overwhelming force (spoiler alert: wait for what sounds like an infernal pipe organ). ""Bury a Horse's Head"" features pockets of laughter amongst its drones. The ghosting tones of ""In a Frosted Lake"" establish a subtle cadence with rate-of-decay parameters. The impossible shapes start and stop abruptly, yet their progression never feels desultory: Moving from one gripping passage to another by way of tapered segues or violent ruptures, every new development opens out inevitably, as in a really vivid nightmare. It's hard to keep a grip on everyday rationality when the record is playing, as it's overwritten by Vainio's implacable script. This uncompromising dictation of reality is, of course, physical as well as emotional. Plenty of records favor headphones, but here, they're simply mandatory, unless you happen to have a very quiet room with a very good sound system. On ""SilencÃ©s Traverses Des Mondes Et Des Anges"", for instance, an important connective passage of juddering quietude simply vanishes without headphones. And it requires you to constantly adjust the volume, which you'll have jacked up during the quiet parts, unless you don't mind subjecting your ears to deliberately inhospitable frequencies as high volumes. ""A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 ML/S"" creates an uncanny effect by paring a tone so high you feel it more than hear it, as a sort of high-altitude pressure in the ear drums, with a soothing rumble that seems disproportionate to its anxious result. It's not too much to call Black Telephone of Matter a sadomasochistic record: In consenting to be mastered, we tap into a dreadful vitality.","Like Kreng before him, Pan Sonic'sÂ Mika Vainio is making dark, compelling, almost frightening music.

Brooklynati,Tanya Morgan,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a616b1335d7bf1698d4e/1:1/w_160/f733f53a.jpg,2009-09-17 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13456-brooklynati/,Interdependent Media,"A lot of people were excited for the 40th Anniversary Woodstock boxed set, but not exactly for the most wholesome reasons-- as undoubtedly the final time that these recordings will see a physical reissue, it was seen by many as a sign that we might start to free ourselves from the pervasive tyranny of Summer of Love boosterism, with all of its self-righteous back-patting and errant historical recounts. (As Douglas Wolk put it in his Pitchfork review, ""the forgotten secret of Woodstock is that it kinda sucked."") Personally, I don't see any sign of abatement on that front, since around the same time, Tanya Morgan's new album taught me that misconstrued nostalgia is pretty much part and parcel of any span of time where great music and worthy ideals intersect: damn if the praise of Brooklynati has me wondering if I've got a faulty memory too. This indie hip-hop group has been lauded as a flamekeeper for a certain time in the early 1990s when the Native Tongues held down New York with a sound that was less overtly Afrocentric but more commercially successful. But didn't Q-Tip appear on a Mobb Deep track? Didn't Phife Dawg threaten to ejaculate on someone in at least two of Tribe's most beloved singles? Wasn't De La Soul Is Dead a pitch-black rejection of the hip-hop hippie aesthetic foisted upon them by rock fans and critics? Couldn't Busta Rhymes and Redman, even at their most rah-rah, come and go as they please? Well, you all know that's true, but Brooklynati instead coasts by on a revisionist historical perspective where Tribe, De La et. al were at the forefront fighting gangsta rap not with innovation or originality, but with common decency. It's a shame too-- I can't remember the last time a record this innocuous and well-meaning irked me so much. Well, maybe I can-- it was either eMC's The Show or the self-titled Slaughterhouse album from earlier this year, both motley supergroups of talented but commercially waning MCs who do a nice rendering of the kind of mid-90s NYC records that they don't have to compete against any more. Fortunately, Tanya Morgan (a partnership of Cincy's Ilyas and Donwill and Brooklyn rapper/producer Von Pea, formed on the Okayplayer message board) brings out the best in each MC-- ""Bang & Boogie"" is an unrelentingly good-natured ode to promiscuity, and I suppose the major difference separating them from their easiest comparisons is that Tanya Morgan has a discernable sense of humor. As such, it's difficult to imagine the good vibes here fucking up any barbecue. But scattin' off soft-ass beats, Tanya Morgan raps happily-- tragically, that style deteriorates rapidly over the span of an hour of Von Pea and Brickbeats' loungy neo-soul. The three have a good rapport with each other, mostly spitting the kind of craft-minded raps (""I wanna be self assured... I did the right thing, following my dream and tightening my writing"") that are considered intelligent because they're not overtly stupid. But too often, these three like-voiced rappers are too genial to step on each other's toes every once in a while or even play too much off each other-- even the most telepathic partnerships in hip-hop need someone to take the lead every now and again, and only guest spots from Blu and Phonte rank as standouts. As with The Show, Brooklynati is most affecting when it finds some sort of purpose in the mundane workings of minor hip-hop celebrity. ""Don't U Holla"" all but begs to be called ""Rap Promoter 2009"", and ""Plan B"" is like some sort of tragic alternate ending to Kanye West's ""Spaceship"". And while there's thankfully little in the way of grumpy complaint rap, after gaining a bit of momentum, Brooklynati throws ""She's Gone (aka Without You)"" at us, assuming what the rap game really needs in 2009 is yet another ""I Used To Love H.E.R."" It just further to illustrate the philosophical dead end Brooklynati seems more than content to head towards: The album spends nearly its entirety trying to revive a sound prevalent in 1994, the same year when Common dropped the original, and the same year where hip-hop was so shamefully out of touch with its artistic roots that it only managed to produce Ready to Die, Illmatic, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Tical, Hard to Earn, Dare Iz a Darkside... So it's only fair that if Tanya Morgan is willing to use the clichÃ©d, borderline misogynist personification of hip-hop as an easily cowed woman with a good heart who can't keep her legs closed, Brooklynati embodies the overused romantic foil: It's hardworking, reliable, sincere, kind-hearted and wouldn't do anything to hurt her. It's the sort you're supposed to settle with after spending one's youth going through exciting yet ultimately ""unrewarding"" flings. But hell, you've seen those divorce rates.","This indie hip-hop group has been lauded as a flamekeeper for a certain time in the early 1990s when the Native Tongues held down New York.

So Tough / Sound of Water,Saint Etienne,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60e5e6ef95969320c47/1:1/w_160/474f730b.jpg,2009-09-17 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13462-so-tough-sound-of-water/,HeavenlyHeavenly,"Has there ever been a record more inviting than So Tough? Yeah, yeah: That's one of those classic contentious record review openers. Open to debate, easy enough to pick apart. I'm sure I could name 10 albums that rival So Tough on that front myself. But when So Tough is actually playing, I'm not sureÂ I can think of any other record I so hope to one day find myself walking around inside of: It's like a bright, hazy early morning captured on disc, those hours where the day is still all potential. In the two years between Saint Etienne's debut, 1991's Foxbase Alpha, and follow-up So Tough, Pete Wiggs, Bob Stanley, and Sarah Cracknell grew confident enough to chase that early morning vibe for a whole LP rather than craft Obvious Chart Hits to cement their status as burgeoning UK pop fixtures. Even the album's catchiest moments -- ""Mario's Cafe"", ""You're in a Bad Way"", ""Avenue"" -- are like sketches snatched from a personal demo reel compared to some of the glitzy indie-bubblegum and D.I.Y. disco on this reissue's second disc of extras and B-sides (cf. ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" and ""Join Our Club""). So Tough is that common paradox of the sampling era: carefully constructed to feel completely casual. Even the sampled movie and TV dialogue sounds more like field-recorded day-in-the-life pub chatter. And Wiggs and Stanley's heavy-duty studio effects soften every instrument. The crispness of the percussion is eroded with reggae-tinted reverb on ""You're in a Bad Way""; ""No Rainbows For Me"" is a slo-mo girl group shuffle drowned in dream-pop noise. A mock-menacing beat familiar to fans of the Beastie Boys (or the Incredible Bongo Band) can be muted into ""Calico"", as agreeably sleepy as kinda-sorta hip-hop ever got. So Tough is a young person's record, in that it suggests there's everywhere left to go in life while seeming in no great hurry to get anywhere in particular. It was made by a trio who'd recently happened upon a singular atmosphere, and then had no problem just soaking the listener in it. The title of the first bonus tune on disc two, ""Everything Flows"", was of course named by Teenagle Fanclub (it's a cover of their debut single), but it summarizes the feel So Tough well enough. But so does its sound: Unutterably gorgeous pop-house with the off-the-cuff quality of both indie and ambient, without ever committing to any on genre. There's still no better soundtrack to whiling away your life in a cafÃ©. Recorded seven years later, Sound of Water is similarly low-key, but with the unmistakable feel of adulthood, the accumulated responsibilities and disappointments. Out goes the unexamined, endearing optimism. Wistfulness has crept in, both lyrically and sonically. It's probably no coincidence that the first single was called ""How We Used to Live"", a multi-part minor masterpiece that came off like someone watching the young lovers of So Tough drift apart in memory.Â On Sound of Water, Saint Etienne's earlier records now seem to represent a world that can be observed, or fondly/painfully remembered, but no longer entered into. And musically, it seems that for the band growing up means smartening up. The swooning ambience of the band's first few records has likewise been buffed away, revealing sleeker, sharper-edged techno-pop. The album is more traditionally stylish, but tinged with an ill-defined sadness. Even the title suggests something beautiful but chilly, and in this case maybe a little too pristine. That's not to say Sound of Water is a bad album, just harder to immediately fall in love with than the cuddly So Tough. The turn of the millennium was a time for many indie-identified Brit bands to suddenly start making their records very slick and traditionally well-made in a very specific ""electronica era"" sort of way. Sometimes, thematically, it worked, as with the aforementioned ""How We Used to Live"". But often, as with the antiseptic digital (or digital-sounding) arrangement of ""Roseneck"", you have to listen past the band's restraint to hear the emotion under the beautiful-but-sterile computer-assisted minimalism. The second disc of era-specific B-sides and bonus tracks is obvious a grab-bag of highs and lows, quality-wise. But the schizo mood-hopping actually helps to undo some of the parent album's stiffness, despite the songs being made with the same materials. You may still not be ready to enjoy the vibraphone again, but it's undeniable that, on the evidence of ""52 Pilot"", Saint Etienne deployed that overused emblem of late-90s high-seriousness more playfully than Stereolab or Tortoise ever managed. Especially since it's bracketed by the icy miniature ""Ivyhouse"" and the more-or-less straightforward club cut ""We're in the City"". Future records would handle Saint Etienne's late-career embrace of age and wisdom and skill with more warmth and less compositional control-freakitude. It probably didn't hurt that they turned back to the organic oddness of rural and urban England as a source of inspiration, rather than continuing to pine for the mock-futuristic placelessness of turn-of-the-millennium continental European laptop gurus. If Sound of Water isn't a Saint Etienne classic, it's not for lack of craft or even inspiration. It's because it's often hard to feel at home in a world where the artists themselves are visitors.","The expanded 2xCD reissues of the St. Etienne catalogue continue with 1993's terrific So Tough and 2000's Sound of Water.

A Brief History of Love,The Big Pink,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6255e6ef95969320c79/1:1/w_160/6607e8ef.jpeg,2009-09-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13469-a-brief-history-of-love/,4AD,"I gotta admit, I'm disappointed the Big Pink didn't issue some sort of nuclear anti-Pitchfork screed when ""Velvet"" only snuck into the tail end of our Top Tracks of the Decade at #500. Robbie Furze and Milo Cordell could be the nicest guys in the world for all I know, but everything about the Big Pink up to this point has been about the huge, swaggering gesture-- their song names read like mission statements (""Crystal Visions"", ""Too Young to Love"", ""At War With the Sun""), the cover art for their singles are 4AD-gone-softcore (check the banned Dennis Cooper pic on the ""Too Young to Love"" single artwork-- your move, Bradford Cox) and, the only thing more full of itself than the band name is the album title*. *It's all loaded with the kind of unshakeable self-confidence that typically leads to daunting hype from Brit mags, ridiculously fun press quotes, and, just maybe, an album that justifies us giving a shit two months from now. As you can guess from that score up there, A Brief History of Love is way better than it needed to be, a bracing and beat-driven debut from a label usually known for shoegaze's more cryptic qualities. But perhaps the most audacious claim made by A Brief History of Love is that Oasis' Be Here Now might've been onto something had its creators not been loaded on cocaine during its recording process (to this day, it's still one of the worst sound engineering jobs you'll hear on a major-label album). This is generally not a popular stance, since history has viewed it as the big loser in Britpop's dinosaur-meet-asteroid summer 1997. But not everyone was interested in following OK Computer's example of using electronic music for texture so much as another avenue towards anthems, and tracks such as ""Bittersweet Symphony"", ""Pure Morning"", ""All You Good Good People"", and, yes, ""D'You Know What I Mean"" proved a natural fit between massive, if rudimentary hip-hop beats and what might otherwise be flag-waving, stadium-filling radio smashes. And so then, the lineage continues with the Big Pink's mighty ""Dominos""-- it's such an undeniable, simple hook, and such an undeniably locomotive but lumbering beat that it steamrolls any doubt you have about the rest of it being underwritten or misogynistic. But more promising is how in spite of the IMAX-ready sonic presence of previously released singles like ""Dominos"" and ""Crystal Visions"",Â History rarely feels something other than hand-crafted. Furze and Cordell produced the album themselves, with engineering done by Rich Costey who, judging from the latest Mew and Glasvegas records, knows his way around huge. A Brief History stills sounds surprisingly nuanced in headphones-- you can enjoy how the group fits an entire album's worth of power chords into a swath of synthesizers that honor their 4AD legacy on ""Dominos"", but from the anticipatory shaker that leads into the hook or the feedback-scratched bridge, repeat listens are rewarded long after they've been demanded. ""Too Young to Love"" hurtles by on momentum more than melody, its raga drone breaking up into shards of scree like a comet through the atmosphere. But almost as hypnotic is the passionate vocal performance on ""Velvet"", which reveals a similar endlessly upward arc to ""Fake Plastic Trees"", right down to the distorted blow-out midway through. Though History never fails to sound elegantly wasted at any tempo, its majority goes in buffet-style on the last two decades of UK's beat-minded rock, united by Furze's Jason Pierce-ing sneer. ""At War With the Sun"" nicks Stone Roses' jangle with nastier distortion pedals, while ""Frisk"" is halfway between Damon Albarn's early forays into funk and the more silken prog of Mansun's Attack of the Grey Lantern. Two years ago, you might've caught Cordell releasing early singles from Crystal Castles and Klaxons on his Merok label, so it's not a surprise that learning on the job resulted in nu-rave wondering how it missed out on shrieking dumb fun like ""Golden Pendulum"" and ""Tonight"". Despite all the cavalcade of classics that A Brief History of Love conjures, my favorite comparison for these guys is actually another youthful, romantically minded British act: The xx. By ""comparison,"" I don't mean ""sounds like""-- Â the two bands seem like they're operating while diametrically opposed. Some might find the Big Pink churlish or even anti-romantic (though I'd argue they hardly spend enough time acknowledging women enough to really comment on them) compared to the restrained and unusually mature xx, who hew more comfortable notions of gender relations. ""Love in Vain"" tries a little tenderness, but ""if you really love him, tell me that you love him again,"" hints at vulnerability before ""then go"" turns the sentiment as cavernous as the reverb surrounding it. But while sometimes you fall for the art of seduction, there's the part of us that want to be overwhelmed--Â A Brief History of Love is a study in the enormity of sound doing just that, each reverbed kick drum, phasers-on-stun guitar, and wastrel vocal refuting the idea that you need to talk about the passion to express it.","A study in the enormity of sound, the debut from this arena-ready UK band delivers on the promise of its early singles.

Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II,Raekwon,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a605c0084474cd0c0873/1:1/w_160/6ca64a9b.jpg,2009-09-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13441-only-built-4-cuban-linx-pt-ii/,EMI,"Yes, it exists, and yes, it's as good as fans have been hoping for. We'll get more in depth on that shortly, but with the two most important questions surrounding this album finally answered after four years of anticipation, that leaves a third one: why a sequel? The easy conclusion is that Raekwon needed a benchmark-- that he couldn't just put together any slapdash collection of skits and weedcarrier features and b-grade beats, then slap the words Cuban Linx on the cover. So while some people might read this album's title as a gimmicky hook to lure in bring-NYC-back nostalgists, it actually acts more as a reassuring seal of quality from an MC who some people think lost his way the moment he released Immobilarity without a single RZA beat. The connections to Cuban Linx's roots of grimy, Mafioso opulence run deep here, starting with a partial reprise of the original album's closer ""North Star (Jewels)"" as Pt. II's opening track. In 1995, Popa Wu admired the way Raekwon was growing and coming up in the world in the same way a master teacher regards his star pupil; 14 years later he's simultaneously marveling at Raekwon's success and warning him of the treachery that elevated status brings. From there we get not so much a single narrative as a vivid overview of a criminal empire that's grown in scope since the first Cuban Linx. Raekwon's gift for deep focus-- homing in on an adversary's apparel one moment, zooming out to take in an entire hood's social system the next-- is at its sharpest, and in running the gamut of criminology rap from kitchen stove to prison yard, he reinforces his reputation as a lyricist with a supreme ability to simultaneously set an evocative scene and turn a slick phrase. Two early detail-oriented highlights come back-to-back: ""Sonny's Missing"", a compact, Pete Rock-produced narrative concerning the grotesque interrogation of a rival segues into the strangely calm crack-cooking setpiece ""Pyrex Vision"", where Rae simmers his voice down to a murmur and gives a tactile snapshot of the crack-cooking process. That mixture of tightly knit procedural storytelling and lyrical virtuosity carries through on the other solo showpieces, the business plan/inventory rundown ""Surgical Gloves"" and the confrontation with a kiss-blowing, shit-talking Jamaican dealer in ""Fat Lady Sings"" chief amongst them. But it's the guest spots that make the album widescreen, particularly with the involvement of every remaining Wu-Tang member (except for U-God, possibly as a canonical continuation of his being ""killed off"" on the first Cuban Linx). Inspectah Deck, Masta Killa, and GZA bolster the narrative, Method Man provides a couple respites from the criminal theme with some flat-out vintage lyrical boasting on early-leak highlights ""New Wu"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"", and the the RZA has a memorably unhinged cameo at the end of ""Black Mozart"". Even ODB's there in spirit, with the Dilla-utilizing ""Ason Jones"" cutting through all the mythologized goofball eccentricity to depict him as a wise man with real love in his heart. All that, and you get Jadakiss and Styles P waxing grimy on ""Broken Safety"", Beanie Sigel at his remorseful best on ""Have Mercy"", Slick Rick pulling diabolical Queen-mocking hook duty on ""We Will Rob You"", and Busta Rhymes dialing down his characteristic bellow to growl on ""About Me"". And then there's Ghost. Maybe the biggest strength of the original Cuban Linx was how well Ghostface and Raekwon complemented each other, with Tony Starks' rampaging wail underscoring Chef's calculating intensity, and Ghost's appearances here hold that same power. He opens his verse on ""Cold Outside"" with one of his most evocatively disturbing lines ever-- ""They found a two-year-old strangled to death/ With a 'Love Daddy' shirt on/ In a bag on the top of the steps""-- and expands that into a ball-of-confusion breakdown of friends' betrayals, AIDS mothers, ""swastikas on the church,"" being broke during Christmas, and the need for troop withdrawal from Iraq. Later on, he has a sharp back-and-forth dialogue-style prison-hustle account with Rae in ""Penitentiary"", castigates a street soldier after being caught getting a blowjob from the man's girlfriend in ""Gihad"", and has a classic outrageous-swagger line in ""10 Bricks"": ""the currency rushes like poppin' a wheelie/ Holdin' a bike with one hand, the other countin' the billies"". Listening to him going R&B on Wizard of Poetry's gonna be weird after this. That said, there's one crucial difference between the two Cuban Linx records that could've tripped this album up: The switch from an all-RZA palette of beats to an all-star roster of production names. RZA does contribute three of the best tracks-- the fuzzed-out cinema funk of ""Black Mozart"", the choral headknock sway of ""New Wu"", and the lavish, orchestral mid-70s soul of ""Fat Lady Sings""-- which fall between his classic first-wave style and a less out-there strain of the experimentation that alienated Ghost and Raekwon circa 8 Diagrams. But aside from Dr. Dre getting a bit too polished and joylessly glossy on the faux-Latin cheese of ""Catalina"" and the plodding ""About Me"", the rest of the production proves to be an eclectic yet fitting take on the classic Wu-Tang aesthetic. ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Ason Jones"", and ""10 Bricks"" benefit from a trip to the Dilla vaults that brought back three of his most RZA-esque beats. The Alchemist's chopped-up chimes and woozy guitars give ""Surgical Gloves"" a hypnotic edge. Pete Rock maintains the integrity of his style with the flute and horn-driven bounce on ""Sonny's Missing"" (repurposed from NY's Finest track ""Questions"" and an even better fit here). And Marley Marl gets a lot of atmospheric mileage out of the subdued yet gripping guitar loop that comprises the 55 seconds of ""Pyrex Vision"". Between the hype, the anticipation and the attachment of a legendary album's legacy, anything less than a classic would have proven to be a major disappointment. Few albums have gone through this much turmoil and delay in the planning stages yet turned out so cohesive and tight.Â The last time a Wu-Tang record came together with this kind of personnel and succeeded under a grand conceptual vision, we got Fishscale, and calling Cuban Linx II Raekwon's equivalent to it isn't out of the question. Like Ghostface's modern classic, this album defies hip-hop's current atmosphere of youthful cockiness and aging complacency: instead, it's driven by the sometimes celebratory, sometimes traumatized sense of stubborn survival and perseverance, a veteran mindset that can no longer picture success without having to defend it. Consider this a triumphant defense.","The Wu-Tang Clan member's long-awaited sequel to his 1995 classic is finally here, and yes, it's as good as fans have been hoping for.

Inglourious Basterds OST,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61e13d19756521390ec/1:1/w_160/c2121db0.jpg,2009-09-16 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13464-inglourious-basterds-ost/,RepriseWEA,"Quentin Tarantino generally sets his movies in the here and now. His characters, on the other hand, are typically some place else, defined at they are by their numerous and often anachronistic affectations, foremost among them an affinity for 1950s rock, 1970s soul, and AM pop. It's those songs that have thus far composed the bulk of Tarantino's classic soundtracks and provided his films many of their most indelible moments. Think Michael Madsen slicing ears to Stealers Wheel or Robert Forster cruising around listening to the Delfonics. Tarantino's approach changed, slightly, with his two Kill Bill installments, which featured RZA rubbing shoulders with recycled Ennio Morricone, but by Death Proof he was mostly back to his usual cratedigging ways. Yet even a filmmaker as audacious as Tarantino probably couldn't get away with pairing his first period flick, Inglourious Basterds, with another snap, crackle, and pop soundtrack. Needless to say, Kool and the Gang's ""Jungle Boogie"" just doesn't jibe with WWII Nazi hunting. But that's not to say Tarantino hews strictly to the straight and narrow, either. Tarantino again shuns an original score, but this time he picks and chooses the film's music selections specifically from a rolodex of forgotten B-movie cues or clever cinematic in-jokes, a smart complement to a film concerned with movie making and its particular powers. The director's said he thinks of Basterds as a spaghetti western (albeit one set in Nazi-occupied France), so he again utilizes relatively obscure Morricone to impose the maestro's trademark weird moods. Other composers of note include the great Lalo Schifrin, with the groovily melodramatic ""Tiger Tank"", and the lesser-known Jacques Loussier, represented here with the title theme to Dark Side of the Sun (which starred Rod Taylor, who crops up in Basterds as Winston Churchill). Even more obscure is the presence of tracks from Gianni Ferrio and Charles Bernstein, whose ""White Lightning"" comes from the forgotten 1973 Burt Reynolds flick (though not forgotten to Tarantino, who also drew on that soundtrack for Kill Bill). Of course, it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without a few pop songs, too, but here Tarantino branches out into fresh territory. Sure, Billy Preston's title theme from 1972's blaxploitation classic Slaughter crops up as a truncated (if still cool) instrumental clip. Beyond that, only a quartet of non-instrumentals appear in the film and on this attendant collection, three of them historically compatible and one of them totally leftfield despite its brilliant use in the film. One, ""Davon Geht Die Welt Nicht Unter"", is a song by Swedish Nazi collaborator (or, more generously, cooperator) Zarah Leander, who lived out her life a pariah for her participation in Hitler's UFA film studios. Another, ""Ich Wollt Ich WÃ¤r Ein Huhn"", comes from Willy Fritsch and Lilian Harvey, the latter of whom escaped under duress from Nazi Germany (her name earns a sneer from the onscreen Joseph Goebbels in Basterds). Last of the contemporaneous lot is Samantha Shelton & Michael Andrew's ""The Man With the Big Sombrero"", most notable in the movie for what goes down in a basement bar when the song ends with the stylus hypnotically hopping along the vinyl's inner edge. That leaves David Bowie's very out of place Giorgio Moroder collaboration ""Cat People (Putting Out the Fire)"", rescued from Paul Schrader's ill-conceived 1982 remake of the Jacques Tourneur masterpiece and repurposed to much superior effect here. It shouldn't work, but it does, mostly because Tarantino realized the track's darker undercurrents suited a pivotal sequence in his film a lot better than the ending credits of Schrader's risible flop, which was lost forever to all but late night cable viewers and obsessive video store clerks with good memories. That Tarantino stored the song somewhere in that trivia filled brain of his for all these years, waiting for the right moment to use it, is one of his gifts as a filmmaker. That he also shows such a knack for stringing together such disparate source material on his various soundtracks (here minus the usual between-track banter) is one of his gifts to us.","Quentin Tarantino's first period piece largely ignores cratedigging pop, rock, and soul, instead offeringÂ forgotten B-movie cues or clever cinematic in-jokes.

God Is Good,Om,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61dc0084474cd0c08a5/1:1/w_160/6f610816.jpg,2009-09-16 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13465-god-is-good/,Drag City,"Breaking up was the best thing Sleep ever did. Sure, they made Jerusalem, a stoner metal masterpiece that was basically an hour of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" riff. But the record was a logical limit-- how much more droning and Sabbath-esque could a band get? When the band split up in the late 1990s, it birthed two behemoths: Guitarist Matt Pike formed High on Fire, while bassist Al Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius formed Om. High on Fire's mixture of MotÃ¶rhead and Black Sabbath has found considerable success, and Om's drums-bass-vocals shtick has also garnered a large following. The two bands are as if Sleep separated into its constituent elements: High on Fire continue (and accelerate) Sleep's midrange roar, while Om explore Sleep's mantra-like low end. Since Om are a duo, Hakius' departure last year caused a stir. His metronomic, cymbal-heavy style was literally half of Om's sound. Many fretted over the choice of Grails' Emil Amos as his replacement. Amos' style is busier, and at first seemed like a poor fit for Om's spareness-- 15-minute head-nodders don't need fills clattering away in the back. However, Amos has turned out to fit right in. His playing is often Hakius-like, with a ride cymbal ticking away to mark time.Â  ""Cremation Ghat I"" is more his own, with a relatively uptempo groove and hand claps. With slinky bass lines, the track isn't that far off from the Folk Implosion's ""Natural One""; however, as an instrumental around three minutes long, it seems like a throwaway. In general, the album is sequenced awkwardly. The first two tracks have vocals and are around 19 and seven minutes long, respectively. Closing out the album is the instrumental two-part ""Cremation Ghat"" suite, which is about eight minutes long. It feels more like a coda than a song. That's too bad, as it's the most interesting section of the record. Not only is the first part more lively than Om's typical lope, but both parts feature tamboura. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand, it adds color to Om's sound. On the other hand, Om did just fine before without additional coloration. Part of the band's appeal has been its ability to utilize its few elements.Â Additionally, the choice of an Indian instrument to accompany Cisneros' hippy-dippy lyrics (""Descends supine grace of the luminant/ Attunes to access light of celestial form"") is too obvious. (The Beatles' dabbling with Indian instrumentation comes to mind.) What was once an implied spirituality, drawn out through trance-like repetition, has become spoon-fed. Perhaps this evolution was inevitable: Like Sleep, Om likely could mine their minimalism only for so long.","Grails' Emil Amos joins Om's former Sleep member Al Cisneros and, despite some fears that he'd busy their sound, he fits right in.

The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs / Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik,Freddie Gibbs,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61f13d19756521390ef/1:1/w_160/4d611c88.jpg,2009-09-16 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13466-the-miseducation-of-freddie-gibbs-midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik/,self-released,"Gary, Indiana is a small, depressed steel town outside of Chicago, best known as the birthplace of music's Jackson family. The town has been hit by wave after wave of economic disaster, and when you drive through it today, it looks like a ruin. Here's how Gary rapper Freddie Gibbs describes the city on his song ""From the G"": ""Land of lost hope/ Clouds of mill smoke/ Community devoured by hard and soft dope."" If beaten-down regional defiance is one of rap's great animating forces, Gary is a great place to be from. On The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs, the first of two very good mixtapes that Gibbs dropped this summer, he complains about not even being able to get on local Chicago radio. Sportswriters call that the ""nobody believed in us"" factor; when the world has written you off, you're that much more determined. Two years ago, Gibbs was signed to Interscope. He's not anymore, but he recorded a pretty hefty chunk of songs with the label. It's not too often that someone can arrive on the mixtape scene rapping over brand-new beats from expensive producers like Just Blaze or Polow da Don, but that's what's happening here. Gibbs has a hell of an ear for beats, and for a while he had access to some of the best producers working. The tracks he recorded in his time at Interscope are all over Miseducation and the even better Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik. And the tracks from unheard producers hold up. Sometimes they do more than hold up; ""Murder on My Mind"" is a bass-heavy seasick lurch, one of the heaviest rap tracks of the year. More than most actual rap albums coming out these days, these two mixtapes have an actual identifiable sound, a varied but cohesive midtempo thump. Gibbs doesn't rap over other people's songs too often, and when he does, they're impeccably selected slices of vintage rap: ""93 Til Infinity"", say, or Goodie Mob's ""Black Ice"". Aesthetically, then, both tapes are as solid as you could possibly hope: Hard, cohesive long-players with hints of the familiar but not enough to make it sound like cliche. They're really albums more than mixtapes, and they're exceptionally well put-together albums at that. But all of this is secondary to Gibbs himself, who emerges as a very serious voice. Gibbs doesn't do anything on either tape to innovate formally. He doesn't resort to gimmickry or showy cleverness. He does one thing-- hard, unpretentious gangsta rap-- and he does it very, very well. Gibbs' voice is a strained, husky growl, one that occupies some of the same tough, honest ground as Z-Ro, say, or Young Buck. He switches in and out of double-time speed-rap almost effortlessly, sounding like he's fully internalized the tricky rhyme-schemes of Midwestern forebears like Twista and Bone Thugs. He sings some of his own choruses in a deep, drawly singsong-- maybe not technically the greatest voice, but one better suited for conveying emotion than at least half the mercenary R&B hook-singers out there. And Jesus Christ he can rap. To really enjoy Gibbs, you have to be OK with the idea of rap songs that graphically chronicle the act of pimping women, in great detail-- including but not limited to what job your girl tells her mother she's working. This is rough, fiery stuff, but it's not entirely amoral. When Gibbs talks about the devastation of his hometown, he sounds seriously pained-- just like he does when he talks about sleeping in a sock drawer instead of a crib as a baby. Gibbs' threats resonate: ""I got a itchy trigger finger and the nuts of a elephant/ Knock the stuffing out your fuckin' muffin just for the hell of it."" But so does his real talk: ""This ain't how I wanna live/ I dream about having kids / But I'm afraid that as they grow they won't see they daddy live."" On ""World So Cold"", Miseducation's closer, he raps about the son he almost had, keeping the fact that the kid was stillborn as a devastating surprise ending. He's a ferocious rapper who can break your heart when you're not expecting it. He's the real thing. Rappers like Gibbs, messy street-rap classicists without crossover-pop instincts or easy marketing hooks, don't get to make albums for labels anymore. So Gibbs has made his own albums-- two within a few months of each other-- and put them out himself. With a little bit of Googling, you can download both for free. For every out-of-touch gazillion rapper putting out a slab of sadness to a massive PR rollout, there's someone like Gibbs, cranking out great music without knowing whether the world will take notice. Guys like Freddie Gibbs are saving rap.","With an armful of new Just Blaze and Polow da Don beats, this Gary, Ind., MC and ex-Interscope signee is breathing fresh air into hardscrabble mixtape rap.

Life of Leisure EP,Washed Out,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a601c0084474cd0c086a/1:1/w_160/5c66ed4d.jpg,2009-09-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13438-life-of-leisure-ep/,Mexican Summer,"Did our parents give us too much self-esteem? Not that long ago, message boarders could diss and dismiss boring new bands (insert your least favorite post-punk revivalists here) for sounding like ""a copy of a copy of a copy."" Fast forward just a few years, and that's exactly what some of the most exciting new bands sound like. Pastiche and intertextuality are as ancient as postmodernism-- not to mention disco, hip-hop, and the remix-- but childhood memories, in particular, are present now like never before. Today's blockbuster movies are based on yesterday's beloved toys; today's wars and political battles are sequels, too. It isn't surprising that music would reflect the zeitgeist. What's striking is how an international cohort of rising artists has successfully translated this culture of watery VCR transfers and Fisher-Price cassette rips into 1980s-inspired psychedelic music. Names like Ducktails, Reading Rainbow, VEGA, Pocahaunted, and, especially, Memory Tapes tell you a lot about where these disparate reminiscers are coming from. Arguably, more than genre tags like ""glo-fi"" or The Wire critic David Keenan's ""hypnagogic pop,"" but those labels can be useful, too. Washed Out, the solo project of Georgia (via South Carolina) multi-instrumentalist Ernest Greene, fits in almost too well with the balmy lo-fi synth atmospherics of peers like Neon Indian, Toro Y Moi, Small Black, the higher-fi jj, or the darker, heavier SALEM, as well as the more guitar-based Real Estate, Best Coast, and Pearl Harbour. Washed Out's debut Life of Leisure EP, out digitally now and on 12"" early next month (another release, the cassette-only High Times, arrived September 15), isn't at the top of its class, but Greene so far is one of this fledgling aesthetic's most gifted students. Focusing on romantic nostalgia and homespun textures, Life of Leisure does with 80s soft rock and synth-pop what Glass Candy and Chromatics did with Italo disco a couple of years ago, only Washed Out evokes summer afternoons indoors rather than the Italians Do It Better crew's early-a.m. urban stalking. Out-of-sync PBS-theme synths and videogame lasers meet funky horn breaks on opener ""Get Up"", as Greene's slurry vocals suggest deep pain. A sampled sax sighs mournfully behind a chopped-up voice, Cut Copy-pasteable beats, and some more indistinct singing on ""Lately"". Life of Leisure's six tracks, whether poppier and more approachable like ""New Theory"", or moody and alarming like ""Hold Out"", tend to cut off suddenly, which gives the EP an appealing, unfinished quality. Like hearing a work in progress: Greene has only been making music under his current moniker for a couple of months, so don't come flaming me if his live shows suck or his Dave Fridmann-produced sophomore album flops in 2013. More than some contemporaries, though, Washed Out submerges a sense of intense feeling within its 80s-fantasy electronic ether. Greene's ""copy of a copy"" distance, then, comes across as a form of emotional repression. The yearning-in-utero effect is strongest on woozy centerpiece ""Feel It All Around"". With blurry singing, cheap-sounding synths, and a humid, syrupy flow, the track suggests an 80s synth pop hit that won't come straight out and cop to itself-- or a young man in love, too tongue-tied (or too stoned?) to admit it. ""You feel it all around yourself,"" Greene echoes. As for what ""it"" is, the song never says. If this review itself reads like a ""memory of a memory"" (to sample another phrase from Keenan), blame ""Feel It All Around"". Days after the filing of a final draft packed with trenchant insights drawn from the similarities between the track's choral drone and 10cc's 1975 hit ""I'm Not in Love"", it came to light that Washed Out's signature tune is actually based around a loop from Gary Low's 1983 single ""I Want You"".

Tribute To,Yim Yames,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a614b1335d7bf1698d49/1:1/w_160/6ed78dd8.jpg,2009-09-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13454-tribute-to/,ATO,"Ronnie, Duane, and heck, even Waylon; those are the hat-tips you'd expect from the lead singer and songwriter of widescreen country rockers My Morning Jacket. George Harrison, however? Hard to imagine he'd be anybody's first pick. He probably wasn't James', either, but in the days following Harrison's late 2001 death, James, his guitar, a reel-to-reel, and precious little else got together to pay, well, Tribute To the quiet Beatle. It's a deeply passionate project, it would have you believe, and it's that passion that gets Tribute To past some of its sonic sameyness and slight sluggishness. But there's just no getting around the fact that these are inferior versions of, to be fair, brilliant recordings-- an inescapable fact James treats with delicacy. You cover the Beatles, and you're just asking for it; that combination of familiarity and fondness on the listener's part simply does not exist in the same way for any other band, and no matter what the song, your take immediately becomes one of hundreds. James smartly opts to work around the more obvious choices in the Harrison catalog; there's ""My Sweet Lord"", yeah, but there's no ""Here Comes the Sun"", ""While My Guitar Gently Sleeps"", or, mercifully, ""Got My Mind Set on You"". James doesn't exactly go way out-- there's nothing past 1970, despite Harrison's fair-to-good track record through the rest of that decade-- but does favor album cuts with plenty of room for his searching, occasionally soaring voice: Revolver's sitar-soaked ""Love You To"", woozy White Album winder ""Long Long Long"", and several more from Harrison's solo opus All Things Must Pass. Though Harrison's tunes-- particularly the ones post-Rubber Soul, as he shook off the twang-rock that characterized his earlier compositions-- are possessed with a wistful, longing quality, there's little thread holding the half-dozen tunes here together beyond their creator and an avoidance of anything above the mid-tempo. That puts the burden of cohesion on James. Comprised of little more than acoustic guitar and the swell of James' high, lonesome voice, Tribute To starts off plenty inviting, with a lovely cover of the loping ""Long, Long, Long"". The slight psychedelic gurgles in the original track are traded in for room sound and falsetto, and James does indeed sound more wounded on the track than we're used to after the ebullient one-two of Z and Evil Urges. But then it's ""Behind That Locked Door""-- itself a tribute to one Bob Dylan-- dressed up in much the same way, but devoid of the original's atmosphere of uplift and Harrison's tender (read: human) vocal. James has always seemed a very technical singer to me; he hits every beat, holds every note just so, andÂ as often as the sound of his voice gets talked about, his expressiveness as a singer doesn't always match up, something Tribute To bears out. Not only does he sing these Harrison songs just like Jim James, but if you've spent any amount of time around either, what you're currently hearing in your head couldn't be closer to the truth. Tribute To is buoyed by ""Love You To"", which switches out sitar for banjo and stoned supplication for a slowly-building swoon, and a damn gorgeous strum through ""My Sweet Lord"", both of which find ways around their original counterparts' famed arrangements. But it closes out with a straightahead take on ""Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp""-- fine, but seemingly an excuse to let James get his voice around the ""let it roll"" exhortations that close it out-- and All Things Must Pass' title track, which James slows to the point of sluggishness by minute three. The ever-languid pace and James' familiar insistence on reverb-- which hangs heavy over nearly everything here-- weighs down Tribute To to the point where its 25 minutes feel far longer. Bear in mind, most My Morning Jacket fans will eat this up; James' voice is in top form, and afterÂ Evil Urges, this is certainly soothing. And it's tough to imagine any Beatlemaniac balking much, either; James avoids imitation, never devolves into parody, and shows a clear love of Harrison's work. Given the quick and dirty circumstances in which it was recorded and the somber mood over the proceedings, it'd help if Tribute To felt a little more, well, imbued with feeling; when you know James sings every song in essentially this manner, it loses a bit of its mournful luster. It's not that Tribute To isn't on some level deeply felt, but it's just not deeply considered, and while it's nice to hear James focused and playing to his strengths after the scattered Evil Urges, his tribute eventually loses the one thread it sets out to carry on its cover. These may be Harrison's songs, but here, the quiet Beatle gets crowded out by James and all his reverb.","My Morning Jacket's Jim James pays tribute to the late George Harrison on this mostly solo acoustic journey through a half-dozen of the quiet Beatle's songs.

"Hey Friend, What You Doing?",Pens,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60613d19756521390b7/1:1/w_160/d0f9000a.jpg,2009-09-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13442-hey-friend-what-you-doing/,De Stijl,"Not to be a complete curmudgeon or anything, but how many of these bands do we seriously need? I should first clarify that in my heart, there will always be a place for crummy, DIY lo-fi-- it might not be the most original shit in the world, but when applied with vigor and creativity, you've got some potentially exciting stuff on your hands. When paired with rote punk variations, laziness that's been confused for brattiness and a profound propensity for short, shambling pop-punk tunes that are as aimless as they are irritating, well, you've got the London-based female trio Pens-- they can't play, shout directionlessly at each other most of the time, and make sure that each song on their debut Hey Friend, What You Doing? sounds exactly like the one before it, a pastiche of uninformed garage footnotes, slug-and-chug hardcore rhythms and boneheaded tee-hee in-jokes. It's not that Pens don't have the steps down or that the dance is tired, but this particular brand of raucous, don't-give-a-fuck pogo-fuel can't be this empty and boring. If more of Friend sounded like the single ""Freddy"" or maybe ""High in the Cinema"", we'd be in business. Carried by a way-cool keyboard melody, four-on-the-floor guitars and the girls' gleefully trying to outshine one another (and occasionally coming in once in a while to shout along together), ""Freddy"" is not only fun, but memorable and repeat-worthy. Even the oi! punk of ""High in the Cinema"" (which, in all fairness, isn't much of a song) boasts a sly cleverness (""We got no money! We gotta break in!"") that compliments Pens' aesthetic and could have potentially saved portions of Friend, though on second thought, maybe it's too slippery a slope to applaud a clever idea from a band that writes songs titled ""Yeah Baby I'll Take You to Bagel Town"" and ""Fuckufuckinfuck"". The varying degrees of lo-finess make this thing sound even more thrown together. There's a distinct, nearly unlistenable tinniness on ""Networking"" that's a world away from the fuzzed out bassiness of opener ""Horsies"" (which also boasts a semi-interesting keyboard lick-- maybe something they might want to think about in the future), suggesting Friend was something pieced together and mailed off right before the post closed. And yes, I'm well aware this was recorded in a bunch of different places with shoddy equipment, but unfortunately you can't make such convenient excuses for the laggard songwriting. Taking into account that they are likely too busy making artwork for Wavves and name-checking Thruston Moore, I'm guessing that these girls probably care less about this band than we initially could assume, but hey, that's what you get when even the band name is a dick joke. But if for nothing else, Pens do provide much needed contrast in the whole lo-fi debate, proving that, sure, anyone can probably do this, but don't don't act surprised when it comes out half-baked.","We might be getting close to some kind of lo-fi tipping point here, folks.

The Broad Street Bully,Beanie Sigel,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60b5e6ef95969320c41/1:1/w_160/7b2a7765.jpg,2009-09-15 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13448-the-broad-street-bully/,Siccness,"I never quite got a handle on whether Beanie Sigel really intended to become a pop sensation. On The Truth, ""Everybody Wanna Be a Star"" decried fame-seeking behavior all while sounding like something the second Mase record might've turned away for being too commercial. But after The B.Coming proved to be his darkest and most affecting record, The Solution had ""All the Above"", with R. Kelly and the Runners and speedboats and everything. You might remember it. You probably don't. Did he really think those won over by ""All the Above"" would've been even more down after ""Go Low"" threatened two forms of sodomy in its first verse and ""H.H.E.H."" set the standard for anti-skinny jeans rap? Whether it's seeing Freeway sign with Rhymesayers or, you know, Roc-A-Fella disintegrating, Beanie's realized it's time to move on and offers ""the lost files"" on The Broad Street Bully, which trades in the same irony as so many other similarly positioned mixtapes: It's constructed in a manner that pleases the sort of people who might actually pay for a Beanie Sigel album, and yet, it's being given away for free. Hell, it's not only an improvement over The Solution, but it's better than most other rap albums out there too-- such is the reality when we get Beanie in his natural state talking serious shit with only State Property alums as guests. Beanie Sigel isn't a complex MC so much as a conflicted one-- The B.Coming is by far his best record because it managed to show how his remorse felt every bit as frightening as his anger, the sort of thing that makes all those tracks he did with Scarface a natural fit. That's not the Sigel you get on The Broad Street *Bully. *Befitting its stopgap, low-stakes formation, Bully is as about as subtle as a curb-stomping and every bit as straightforward, 12 tracks that mostly go into rich detail about you being a sucker and Beanie's ability to beat the living shit out of you. ""The ignorance is coming,"" he intones, and while that likely refers to the title of his yet unannounced new album, you can be goddamn sure that the ignorance is here right now. It might be a simplified rendering of Beans, but it's tough to care when it's so damn entertaining. Whether it's due to his no-nonsense subject matter or pugnacious persona, Beans rarely gets the credit he deserves as a lyrical craftsman, but there's not much to distract you this time around from his haughty humor, rife with internal rhyme and off-kilter cadence. ""You'll forever be stuck under the baker's thumb/ You keep dealing with them crumbs/ Keep dealing with them bums who receive their funds in minute-sized sums."" Such goes a line from ""Why Wouldn't I"" but elsewhere, he lets off punchlines brimming with self-satisfaction and double entendre. As far as surprises go, you'll have to take what you can get here-- the beats are just functional, even if the brazen Queen rip on ""All For It"" is kinda hilarious for never bothering to be cleared. Outside of Beanie's usual State of the Hood address (""The Ghetto""), about the only thing that goes off-topic is ""Run to the Roc"", where a subdued sample of the Slickers ""Johnny Too Bad"" backs Beanie's just-vague-enough hashing of his relationship with his former label-- ""Another lie told by Ol' Blue Eyes/ Blue is the color of deception, to my recollection,"" either referring to Jay-Z's insistent Sinatra-likening or any one of the Blueprint albums. There's more potential intrigue in hearing Dynasty role players like Young Chris (who's been on some kind of winning streak as of late) and Omillio Sparks give up the goods about Jigga's acumen as an executive, but somehow their restraint proves more powerful-- it might seem petty for someone at Chris' level to claim people planning his demise, but you've read a rap blog lately, right? It's even worse when people actually can bring you down. But in a way, ""Bang Bang"" is the most revealing track on Bully, where Beans and State Prop associate Murda Mill riff on western films to further illustrate the numerous ways in which they can kill you. Besides being extremely comprehensive, it's jarring as well, an undoubtedly nerdy moment for a career that, outside of ""Mac Man"" isn't exactly brimming with them. But it's a heartening inclusion: Beanie might be myopically focused on the Art of War on The Broad Street Bully, no one works harder to make violence more graphic.","After the demise of Roc-A-Fella, Beanie unearths a collection of ""lost"" tracks for a free mixtape that doubles as his best work since The B.Coming.

Ashes Grammar,A Sunny Day in Glasgow,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a602ea9e61561daa528c/1:1/w_160/73310d08.jpg,2009-09-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13440-ashes-grammar/,Mis Ojos Discos,"The predominance of digital-editing software and increased use of sampling have made piecing together an album a much easier task than it once was. Ashes Grammar, the sophomore album from Philadelphia septet A Sunny Day in Glasgow, doesn't sound composed with modern tools-- overdubs ad infinitum-- but like pop musicÂ masterfullyÂ puzzled together.Â Featuring bushels of tracks that blur the line between interlude and song, many listeners will associate the two-dozen-strong tracklist with either unfinished business or lazy editing, but Ashes Grammar is a surprisingly disciplined affair. Watch the band tunnel a small groove during ""Evil, With Evil, Against Evil"", drop it, and pick it back up again before moving quickly on. They mine the ringing, orbital electronics of ""Canalfish"" for 90 gorgeous seconds before letting it slip into ""Loudly""'s more concrete whoosh. ""Passionate Introverts"", however, needs its four-plus minutes of glowing pulse to deliver its serpentine melodies and abstracted nostalgia (""Do you believe in dinosaurs at all?"", asks the chorus), and SDIG provide it the necessary breathing room. Summed, the shifting tracks pull Ashes Grammar through its hour-long runtime smoothly and patiently. Ashes Grammar is more propulsive than SDIG's debut, Scribble Mural Comic Journal, whose effects-heavy compositions sometimes felt leaden or overconsidered. ""Blood White"" and ""Loudly"" thrum along with Krautrock-y beats. Those rhythms, when mixed with SDIG's lite-psych jams, recall Caribou's The Milk of Human Kindness or MÃºm's whipped electro-folk. The band plays with contrast, often layering their catchiest and most concrete vocals (""Passionate Introverts [Dinosaurs]"", ""Failure"") over their least tidy, far-flung compositions, while their most traditionally orchestrated moments (""The White Witch"", ""Close Chorus"") receive affected cooing and wordless harmonizing. If there's a real complaint to be lobbed at Ashes Grammar it's that the vocals are too often buried, and their mushmouth-y Liz Fraser-timbres too willingly blended into the pooled sonics. If SDIG didn't imbue so much of Ashes Grammar with a terse rhythmic presence, many of these songs would easily be swept into the ether. Ashes Grammar is not for those who need their pop music spit-shined and robust. Instead, SDIG form their hooks stealthily, letting acoustic guitars and a steady patter rise from the ambient beginnings of ""Starting at a Disadvantage"" or repeating phrases amidst the disparate stretches of ""Nitetime Rainbows"". ""Close Chorus"" offers big, breaking hooks only after four minutes of morning chatter. Ashes Grammar draws you in by offering outstanding moments in strange contexts; you'll re-listen to hear specific pieces even though you're unable to remember exactly when and how they occur. Ashes Grammar often feels like the result of a band who took Martha Reeves & the Vandellas' ""Come and Get These Memories"" in the most abstract, art-damaged way possible: nostalgic, jigsaw pop music from a group of writers strong enough to keep you humming and courageous enough to make you guess.","Philly septet continues its winning streak on this sprawling and ambitious affair, masterfullyÂ puzzled together from a wide range of parts.

The Resistance,Muse,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a609ea9e61561daa529d/1:1/w_160/64261600.jpg,2009-09-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13453-the-resistance/,Warner Bros.,"As with so many 21st-century mainstream (or quasi-mainstream) rock albums unafraid to stuff 10 tons of quasi-operatic melodrama into 60 or so minutes, The Resistance will be easily dismissed by those into the Grizzly Bear/Dirty Projectors brand of orchestrated art-rock. You know, where the album has a pleasing ramshackle feel under the surface-level skillfulness, the sense that the vocal acrobatics or tricky instrumental interplay could suddenly veer into uncomfortable, mock amateurish expressionism. By contrast, you never get the sense that Muse are anything less than in total control of their ""difficult"" music at all times. Throughout The Resistance, frontman Matt Bellamy is ready and willing to foreground his chops, be it tickling the ivories, hopping octaves, or tossing out increasingly tasteful solos. If the The Resistance is ""about"" anything, aside from the conceptual malarkey encoded in the lyrics, it's about mastery, ego-security, etc. It's the kind of all-caps, no half-stepping ART-ROCK that closes with a three-part mini-epic so shameless about its own classic rock bigness that it's billed as a ""Symphony"", complete with ""Overture"". Jumped ship yet? For the wary or outright dismissive, however, The Resistance is also a very smartly sequenced album. it opens with the most ""pop"" sequence of the band's career, a three-song sequence aping the stadium-grade synth-rock of Depeche Mode at their crossover height. It then segues into a middle section of hard (but not too hard) rock, nodding in the direction of grottier bands like Queens of the Stone Age or System of a Down without stripping away the sparkle. Only then does The Resistance shift into the sort of fist-pumping, kitchen-sink prog you were probably expecting. It's canny: Leading the uncommitted down a drum machine paved path of catchy 1980s revivalism and straight into the path of an army of kids straddling the gap between entry-level classical and ""Headbanger's Ball"". And ""army"" is right: Unity in the face of faceless post-industrial society grinding down beautiful stuff like love and friendship is perhaps Muse's great theme. Bellamy is constantly tossing out mass-shout-along-ready lyrics like ""we will be victorious"" and ""they won't stop breaking us down."" Songs get titles like ""Uprising"" and (natch) ""Resistance"". Things break down easily into a ""we"" (rarely does an ""I"" creep into Bellamy's songwriting) and a ""they."" Your age-old, rock-standard good (we, the fans) vs. evil (them, the nebulous straight government-corporate nexus) set-up, got it? But unlike the creepy mass-rally overtones that so bugged early rock critics about music designed to pack civic centers-- or thrilled them when it was punk leading in the kids in revolt-- you get the sense that Bellamy's lyrics are an outgrowth of wanting to make his music as big and inclusive as possible, rather than any inchoate political impulses. No doubt Bellamy fancies himself some sort of social crusader, but his mush-headed vagueness (like Bono and Chris Martin and just about any Brit frontman operating on this scale) is designed to inspire warm fuzzy feelings of togetherness and resistance rather than offer any ten-point plan to overthrow the emotionally fascist modern world. So let's take the warm fuzzy bigness of the music at face value. It's understandable if the Buckley mannerisms and Mercury multi-tracking on ""The United States of Eurasia"" aren't your cup of tea. You may cringe at the Pavlov-approved crescendos that surge through ""Guiding Light"", the sort of thing where you imagine a ProTools preset producers have nicknamed ""10,000 People Holding up Bics They Bought Especially for the Concert."" And then there's ""Exogenesis"", the aforementioned ""Symphony"" in three parts. Now a Daydream Nation style knowing ""trilogy"" this is not. There's massed strings. There's half-time chest-beating theatrics ready for flashpots and Vegas set design. If it's not quite Keith Emerson's territory-- or Celine Dion's, for that matter-- it's a similarly grandiose ballpark where the fans wear slightly different clothes. But still: I'm a punk at heart, suspicious about the meeting of rock band and orchestra after all these years, and even I have to admit there's something cornily beautiful about ""Exogenesis"", like Radiohead with no fear of pushing things until the motor bursts into flames. Judged on its own terms-- out of control scale, genre-smashing ambition, musical and vocal virtuosity-- The Resistance is a success. It's just the kind of success where you have to appreciate a guy who builds his own guitars daring himself to make the next song even more rapturously overstuffed and classically cathartic. It's an album you can embrace or get the fuck out of its way. There's really no in between. It's high-test pop-prog hokum, better suited to mashing buttons to kill wizards or gorging on a stack of four-color batshittery than working on your thesis or darning your socks. Video games or comics are probably a closer comparison than most of the music Pitchfork covers, actually. There's a prevailing idea that there's something spiritually and emotionally dangerous about grown men and women spending most of their alone-time immersed in improbable fantasies where interpersonal relationships and the traumas of the real world can be dispatched/ignored via magical powers. But do you want to wallow in grey impotence in the face of quotidian bullshit every damn minute of the day? Escape, whether via Matt Bellamy or the Immortal Iron Fist or the fine folks at Nintendo, shouldn't be a dirty word, at least when used sparingly.","Muse are back, with an LP of all-caps, no half-stepping ART-ROCK that closes with a three-part epic so shameless about its size it's billed as a ""Symphony.""

The Velvet Underground & Nico,Record Club,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60d5e6ef95969320c43/1:1/w_160/af49a01a.jpg,2009-09-15 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13455-record-club-the-velvet-underground-nico/,self-released,"As the Internet has proved a-billionfold over by now, anybody can do a cover song. Be it fanboy karaoke love letters, guilty-pleasure attention-grabs, lazy B-side filler, or just plain amateurs singing into their laptops and broadcasting the results on YouTube, there's a seemingly unquenchable thirst for musical masquerading. Now covering an entire album, that takes a special testicular virility and devotion, a feat that only a few bands have had the gall (or the chops) to attempt-- your Camper van Beethoven, your Pussy Galore, your Petra Haden, your Phish. The motivations might be the same as covering a single track, but the commitment is exponentially higher. Just think of all the chords and words you have to learn! So I doff my cap to Beck for making not just one attempt at full-album reenactment, but launching a whole systemic ""Record Club"" effort of recreations on his website. The game is this: Beck, and whatever L.A. scene buddies are around, spend a day covering a chosen album without rehearsal or forethought, though presumably they're printing out some lyric sheets. It may seem self-indulgent, but in practice it's likely a hell of a lot of fun. It's also an A+ use of a website, embedded video players, and a home studio, and considering the people involved, is way more interesting than most albums of original material. To launch this project, Beck aimed low, choosing a little-known cult record called The Velvet Underground & Nico. Seriously though, it's a ballsy move but a smart one-- icons, after all, wear fawning worship well, and I'm much more skeptical about his in-progress follow-up pick, Leonard Cohen's Songs of Leonard Cohen. The roster for VU & Nico features frequent co-conspirator Nigel Godrich, members of Beck's touring band and ""Introducing Thorunn Magnusdottir as Nico."" Oh, and Beck's bro-in-law Giovanni Ribisi, who the singer claims is ""a virtuoso of just shredding."" So with all the pieces assembled, Beck and his merry band faced a fork in the road: straightforward covers, or complete reworkings? Perhaps unsatisfyingly, they choose neither: ""Sunday Morning"" suggests faithfulness will be the move, with a sleepy cello-enhanced arrangement that is a passable forgery of the original. Here, and elsewhere, Beck's Codeine head-cold voice is a passable replacement for Lou Reed, nailing the opiate haze if not quite reaching the snide pathos underneath. ""Waiting For the Man"" is where the Record Club starts to diverge from the source material, and here it's not for the best. Rather than being the taut, paranoid shuffle a song about waiting for your drug dealer really should be, Beck & co. make it a ramshackle hootenanny, the approach being ""everybody grab the nearest instrument and vamp."" Unfortunately, that seemed to be the instructions for most of VU & Nico's epic drones, ""Venus in Furs"" and ""Heroin"", and ""European Son"" all losing their edge in overly busy arrangements and carrying a noticeable John Cale-shaped hole. ""Heroin"", in particular, is a trainwreck, with Brian Lebarton forgetting the words and screaming his way through the peaks, completely missing the seething calm that is so disarming about Reed's addict on the original (his little chuckle gets me every time). But not all the makeovers are a downgrade. In the middle of the record, ""Run Run Run"" and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" get electro-pop treatments that shouldn't work on paper, but do. The original ""Run Run Run"" always struck me as a jammy toss-off anyhow, and it's much improved by a simple drum loop and video-game rubber bass. The legendary ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" might be a harder sell, but with Magnusdottir doing Nico's ESL thing and space-y details that are pocket-Godrich, it's a gorgeous re-imagining. The project's other score is maybe its humblest, a simple, delicate ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" that is as reverent as it is pitch-perfect. For all the Velvets' rep as the big scary black leather bondage and hard drugs band, it's a nice reminder that Reed could write an adorable pop song when he wanted, even if the ""reflect what you are"" backing vocals on the outro always creeped me. Less subversive creepiness here, but I maybe even (gasp) prefer the cover. So surprise surprise, the spontaneous album-covering gimmick project is uneven and goofy. Much of the context that lifts The Velvet Underground & Nico to the top of many a music snob's favorite records list-- the anachronistic late-1960s doom and gloom, the death drone, Nico herself-- aren't present here. And there's not really a replacement message, a musical theme to suggest why Beck chose this record. It may not be the cover album that inspires everyone who listens to start a cover band, but it's a fun, ambitious idea that turns up a handful of moments worth ripping off the Vimeo feed.","Making great use of his home studio and L.A. friends, Beck kicks off his off-the-cuff, unrehearsed covers of full LPs by taking on VU's debut.

Orange You Glad,Julian Lynch,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fcea9e61561daa527a/1:1/w_160/6ea75a80.jpg,2009-09-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13439-orange-you-glad/,Olde English Spelling Bee,"""How patient are you?"" It's not a very encouraging question when talking pop records, let alone a bedroom-psych pop record from the mind of a guy going for his Master's in ethnomusicology. But those of us who still consider patience to be a virtue will find that Julian Lynch's debut full-length Orange You Glad is full of great little moments that gradually (and successfully) cultivate songs brimming with hushed wonder. What really saves these four-track recordings from relying too heavily on aimless atmospherics is a profound interest in late-1960s psychedelia-- I'm guessing that spending most of your time writing lengthy papers about native Tunisian music is either going to heavily influence the record you are making, or drive you deep into the garage, back to a stack of Love LPs. Most of us already familiar with Lynch probably are so as a result of his work with the Underwater Peoples label and their associates (he frequently plays in and with Ducktails, his ""Banana Jam Pt. 1"" was a highlight on this summer's Underwater Peoples Records Showcase sampler). But Lynch might soon have a niche all of his own thanks to the various improvisations on Orange, all anchored by uniformed suites of airy electronics, slow-burn rhythms, and his garbled coos and whines. Even the most patient (i.e., stoned) listener probably wouldn't come back for seconds if this was all there was to absorb, but Lynch interjects these weird little set pieces on almost every song-- that crazy low-budget Jimi Hendrix lick on opener ""Venom"", that quirky-cool bird-call synth blip on the too-short highlight ""Rancher""-- that gives these pieces real character on an album that could have could have lazily revisited the same tones and ideas in an effort to over-establish ""feel"". ""Winterer One"" nicely encapsulates a lot of the stronger points on Orange. ""I saw witchcraft tonight,"" sings Lynch (it's one of the few discernable lyrics on the whole album, but one helpfully indicative of the moods explored here) over muffled tambourines and a bleary acoustic guitar line that gorgeously melts into a set of buttery-soft synth tones. It's a quiet victory with the etherealÂ  sadness of a Nebraska cut, oddly welcoming and calming. ""Mercury"" would be a big time throw-away if it weren't for Lynch's elusive clarinet carrying the whole thing, weaving in and out of those aquatic guitar textures like a fish through an anemone. And the fractured psych of ""Andaza"", it's violent wah-wah pedals screaming in the face of melancholic ho-hummery all make for wonderfully contrasted pop pieces that make the patience so virtuous. Of course there is the obligatory 11-minute droner ""The Flood"" smack dab in the middle of the thing, a tedious rumination that plays like a very drugged-out seance for a snake charmer, only not a pinch as awesome as that might sound. You can't help but feel a little exhausted after it, leaving ""Winterer Two"" to stand as an unnecessary epilogue and rendering the syrupy far-outness of ""Seed"" a little bland. Moments like these curry some favor with those worried that Orange might not be much more than a welcome addition to your ""Sleep"" playlist, but that application seems somewhat backwards with such wide-eyed intrigue being so delicately stoked time and again.

Out Into the Snow,Simon Joyner,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60aea9e61561daa52a0/1:1/w_160/db6a59f8.jpg,2009-09-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13447-out-into-the-snow/,Team Love,"Out Into the Snow seems an odd title for a Simon Joyner album. His music is often desolate, to be sure, but I can't say it's ever felt cold. Also, from his songs it doesn't seem like Joyner ever goes out-- his poetic lyrics give me the feel of a cloistered life, like he spends his days alone projecting himself into characters that face life for him. He's not just a little like Leonard Cohen, and that extends from the feeling his recordings embody to the way he sings. His voice is a broken instrument, gesturing toward melody as much as actually singing it, and it could be a sticking point for a lot of listeners. He's had that style for almost 20 years now, so fans are used to it, even love it, and you can see it a couple of ways. Some will hear a voice that can't convey its songs, while others will hear a powerful foil for the ramshackle country/folk/chamber backing of his band, not to mention a croak that reflects the tone of the writing. I admit that even as a seasoned Joyner listener, there are still moments where I wish he'd just hit the note, and on this record, there is one song where that's the case. Closer ""Roll On"" is a mid-tempo country tune soaked in pedal steel guitar, saloon piano, and backing vocals by Sarah Gleason and Pearl Lovejoy Boyd that all roll along just fine, apart from the fact that Joyner is just kind of tunelessly there in the mix. It has the effect of your drunk friend singing along to the band in a bar, and while that can be fun while it lasts, you wouldn't want to listen to a playback of it the next day. The other tempos are slower, the music less celebratory, and the songs more suited to his style. At the other end of the record, the nine-minute opener ""The Drunken Boat"" is a masterful drifter's narrative that moves seamlessly in its middle from understated country backing to dark chamber folk dominated by Laraine Kaizer's intricate string arrangement-- the point where the song makes the full transition is perhaps the biggest surprise in his whole discography, and the song's final third is pretty breathtaking, getting progressively lusher until Joyner is left behind by the violins as they spiral off into silence. Kaizer's sympathetic arrangements help make a couple of other tracks, too, especially ""Ambulances"", where the fluttering strings and ghostly backing harmonies create a haunted atmosphere. As the electric piano, glockenspiel, pedal steel, and acoustic guitars pile up on top of those elements, it makes for an almost comically full arrangement for such a skeletal song. For a guy who's much more a poet than a singer, Joyner seems to love a good musical flourish, and he doesn't miss many opportunities for one here. He goes for a different flavor on ""Last Evening on Earth"", with the band laying down an inky blues-noir track to accompany lines like ""the moon crashed in your whiskey glass and it took away all your friends."" Out Into the Snow is another solid entry in a long career for Joyner, and it seems his place as the dark observer on the indie world's fringe is pretty well set. And that's fine-- this is music that needs time to settle and grow into you, and that's a mission often best accomplished away from the harshest glare of spotlights.","Like a modern-day Leonard Cohen, Simon Joyner's poetic lyrics and beaten-down vocals gesture as much to characters or melodies as they do articulate them.

The Almighty Defenders,The Almighty Defenders,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6035e6ef95969320c2b/1:1/w_160/be250096.jpg,2009-09-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13427-the-almighty-defenders/,Vice,"Supergroups: Sometimes you get Cream, and sometimes you get a bunch of people who spontaneously engage in a slapdash recording session that may or may not involve absurd conceptual pseudo-alter-egos. One of the end results of the Black Lips' possibly kicked-outta-India incident back in January, aside from a deluge of some of the most breathlessly manic press-release freakouts I've ever read, was an emergency stopover in Berlin to recuperate/decompress with King Khan and Mark ""BBQ"" Sultan. Apparently the mood was so charged and jubilant in the aftermathÂ they celebrated by spending eight days recording an ""evil gospel"" album. Well... shit, why not? It's important to keep this narrative in mind when listening to The Almighty Defenders, because it definitely sounds like it took no more than a week to exist from conception to completion, even if it's probably more likely that the group's actually a culmination of a more long-stewing collaborative interest. It's a hasty sounding album in pretty much every sense of the word, with spontaneous-sounding takes and muddy recording that sounds almost surreptitious. It's like listening in on a bunch of like-minded friends screwing around in a jam session, which it technically pretty much is. The album contains 10 originals and a cover of the Mighty Hannibal's ""I'm Coming Home"", all of which fall pretty strongly in line with what you might expect from a Black Lips/King Khan & BBQ Show hybrid, only messier and more incoherent: lots of garage-soul wailing, drums that sound like they're being hit with a stake-driving hammer, snarling guitar riffs lathed into crude, shambling catchiness, and the occasional UHF station Horror Chiller Theater organ. Both bands' propensity to run the wider gamut of pre-psychedelic rock'n'roll is bolstered a bit by the gospel underpinnings, though many of the songs-- sludgy vintage rhythm & blues (""Bow Down and Die""), amped-up doo-wop (""Cone of Light""), goonish blues-rock (""Over the Horizon"")-- don't need too far of a push to get there. It's a shame that the on-the-fly nature of this album dampens what could've been a superb collaboration given another month's worth of studio time, though there's moments where they manage to pull through anyways; leadoff track ""All My Loving"" isn't all that complicated, but it gets its hooks in you quick. Now if only I could figure out what they're singing. The biggest downfall of The Almighty Defenders is that most of the vocals seem to be miked sloppily, so while you get a nice fuzzed-out quality to the call-and-response chants and the wild-assed choirboy choruses, the actual lyrics often get subsumed into this big swirl of noise. It's especially bad on ""Cone of Light"", where Mark Sultan's amazing deranged-Sam-Cooke voice, strong as it is, still winds up smothered under percussion. When the irreverent-gospel theme is decipherable, it can be pretty striking, if frequently a little too prone to self-aware, button-pushing edginess: ""Jihad Blues"" is a demented sweet-chariot-ride song that invokes exactly what you think it does (""just gimme a boxcutter and a one-way ticket""), and I'm banking on ""The Ghost With the Most"" being the first time in recorded history that the Holy Spirit is invoked using a catchphrase from the movie Beetlejuice. But maybe the spirit's more important than the letter anyways: there's two tracks in a row (""30 Second Air Blast"" and ""Death Cult Soup n' Salad"") that are mostly just incoherent howling and mumbling and the occasional Three Stooges imitation, and they might be the most ecstatic moments on the album. Maybe the most profound, too.","Black Lips, King Khan, and Mark Sultan spent a week crafting this record in Berlin. And it sounds like it.

Crazy Rhythms / The Good Earth,The Feelies,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5feea9e61561daa5284/1:1/w_160/8b2a1d14.jpg,2009-09-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13403-crazy-rhythms-the-good-earth/,DominoBar/None,"The Feelies formed as a four-man rock band in a New Jersey suburb whose biggest 20th century shakeup was a textile strike. They wrote some original material and learned a couple of Beatles songs. They took their show 20 miles southeast to Hoboken, drove to Manhattan under the Hudson River, tucked in their shirts, pushed their glasses up on their nosebridges, and unleashed a kind of hypnotic punk-lite so buttoned up that it sounds choked-- like they counted to four and grabbed an electric fence. Did I say the Feelies are a rock band? I misspoke. They're a particle collider. Crazy Rhythms, their 1980 debut, has none of the attitudinal markings of rock-- no looseness, no swing, no danger, no laughs. Its cover-- a band portrait on a sky-blue void, echoed 14 years later on Weezer's ""blue album"" -- is bland and eerie. It looks like a misplaced rendering of four boys whose closest contact with rock music came from fixing radios. The title of the album appears as some innovative form of non-joke. And yet, and yet. Three-chord punk-- apparently too excessive for them-- is boiled down to two-chord devotionals: one for the first three minutes, one for the second. Two- and three-note guitar solos drone over the mix like a Muezzin's call. Bill Million and Glenn Mercer sing in grey, unimpressive voices-- probably influenced by the Velvet Underground, but just as likely a product of the belief that lead vocals were for generally immodest people. The focus and direction of the sound hangs on Mercer and Million's guitars, but the essence of the album-- the DNA sequence not found anywhere else-- is its percussion tracks. Cymbals and hi-hats are ignored almost entirely-- too cathartic, too showy. Almost every track is overdubbed with a dry chorus of cowbells, claves, woodblocks, bells and maracas. Glenn Mercer's credit on a cover of the Beatles' ""Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey"" reads: ""other guitar, vocals, bell, coat rack."" Drummer Anton Fier thumps out the words NOT TIRED YET NOT TIRED YET NOT TIRED YET in Morse code on his tom-toms. Presumably, shows ended with the rest of the band unplugging him. It's fastidious, committed and unendingly tense music. A couple of tracks-- first single ""Fa Ce'-La"" and ""Original Love""-- take the shape of pop songs: A few minutes, a few parts, a verse, a chorus. Most of the songs, though, are shaped like Steve Reich or Philip Glass compositions: Music that creates drama by swelling, shading and repeating, not carving out peaks and valleys. The album's longest, most arresting tracks -- ""Forces at Work"" and ""Crazy Rhythms""-- don't seem to change as much as dilate. The music on the album is rare, but the tone-- especially with the knowledge that it was never really replicated by any other band-- is rarer. Weezer, the Talking Heads and the Modern Lovers used their social eccentricities as badges of honor and safe vantage points for self-expression. The Feelies don't sound any more comfortable on Crazy Rhythms than you imagine they might standing in a room full of strangers or mountain lions. They sound commanded by inspiration, almost religiously single-minded. Mark Abel, who co-produced the album with Mercer and Million, called them ""the most obstinate people I've ever met."" According to Jim DeRogatis's liner notes for the reissue, they started telling adulatory interviewers that driving through the Holland Tunnel gave them headaches. Crazy Rhythms is their big album. Their talked-about one. The Good Earth, produced by R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and released six years later, is their little one. Bassist Keith DeNunzio and Anton Fier left the band (Fier went on to play with Bill Laswell, Pere Ubu, John Zorn and a gymnasium's worth of notable avant-rock musicians). Dave Weckerman, Brenda Sauter and Stan Demeski-- all local musicians Million and Mercer had been tooling around in side projects with-- joined. The tempos are relaxed, the percussion understated, the instrumentation largely acoustic. It's no less hypnotic than Crazy Rhythms, but it has a different notion of infinity: Wheat fields, Sunday drives, childhood bedtimes to the sound of adults murmuring from the living room.Â The cover image-- the band, slightly sepia-toned and standing in tall grass-- is a rural reconsideration of Crazy Rhythms, a stepping back. Mercer's vocals are a stream-of-consciousness hum under the shimmer of guitars. ""Being a guitar player,"" he said, ""I don't have much of a need to express myself as a singer"" -- a claim that makes you think the guitar solos are going to be fireworks, and they aren't. Fireworks are not what the Feelies were about. You don't hear too many people talking in hyperbole about The Good Earth is for the same reasons you don't hear people talking in hyperbole about taking a nap in the park. Listening start-to-finish, it sounds even more removed than Crazy Rhythms, an album that blurs together and exists unto itself-- different enough from their first album to be incomparable, different enough from a lot of other music-- even R.E.M.-- to be unmistakable as anyone else. These albums have been out of print for several years. If you were lucky (or old) enough to own them the first time around, buy them again. The bonus material is nothing special: New live recordings from their recent reunion shows, a couple of demos, a couple of older covers (but not the cover of ""Paint It, Black"" appended to the last edition of Crazy Rhythms). And you have to download the songs using a little business card with a serial number because the band thought the albums should stand on their own, which they should. But oh the glorious sound. I am not someone who relaxes on an animal hides in front of four-foot tall speakers and compares the relative merits of recordings, but I will tell you that these remasters sound fantastic-- crisp, nuanced, and all kinds of other luxurious adjectives. Apparently, there's a dog barking the background of The Good Earth interlude ""When Company Comes"". Someone mumbles during the guitar break on ""Let's Go"". And the coat rack, as clear and unexpected as ever.","Three-chord punk boiled down to two-chord devotionals, these two amazing Feelies recordsÂ are back, and both are worth a lot of your time.

The Blueprint 3,JAY-Z,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fdc0084474cd0c085e/1:1/w_160/41283523.jpg,2009-09-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13445-the-blueprint-3/,AtlanticRoc Nation,"Who's been responsible for The Blueprint 3's biggest PR boost thusÂ far: Kanye West or Rihanna? Timbaland or Drake? Um, LeBron James?Â According to our RSS, the answer would appear to be Ed Droste. Now, aÂ few years ago, a YouTube of Jay-Z swaying lazily to ""Ready, Able""Â might've been a ""gotcha"" moment worthy of the Summer Jam Screen, butÂ in 2009, the buzz it's generated is either a huge breakthrough for theÂ hip-hop/indie conversation or a sign that seeing Jigga in the sameÂ room as Grizzly Bear is more exciting than hearing him on the sameÂ song as any of the all-stars that populate The Blueprint 3: After all,Â The Blueprint 3 is so certainlyÂ Jay-Z'sÂ weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if Kingdom Come was somehow underrated. While ""30 Something"" and ""Beach Chair"" might stand as some of the most smug hip-hop ever committed to tape, they at least came from a real place, which illustrated the ""curse"" Jay so often speaks of: Nearly all of his LP's are concept albums about the state of his career, but in the 21st century, he's needed some sort of external boost to make it work, whether it's announcing his dominance of New York, his retirement, or the ability to play fast and loose with Frank Lucas' biography. Maybe it's just the timing, but like any recent MTV VMA's, Blueprint 3 generates its event-ness from a stubborn belief in its own ability to be an event. As such, most of it finds Jay-Z dealing in contradictory impulses-- to remind listeners of his unparalleled success in the rap game, but just as often, imploring everyone to stop thinking about his unparalleled success and get on some ill-defined ""next shit."" Honest question-- did Kanye West pull an inside job on Big Brother here? I mean, he gets all the good lines on ""Run This Town"" and getting Jay to follow his punchdrunk, slouchy flow on ""Hate"" has to be the result of some bar bet. But it isn't a matter of Kanye fronting him bad beats as much as a state of mind, the sort of maniacal need for approval that often humanizes Kanye but just makes Jay-Z sound insecure and whiny (see: most of The Blueprint 2). ""Niggas want my old shit/ Buy my old album,"" he sneers in ""On to the Next One"" over a hyperactive Swizz Beatz track that indicates Jay's not the only one trying to sum up his entire career within the span of four minutes. But ""Thank You"", ""Reminder"", and ""So Ambitious"" all go to great lengths to reiterate accomplishments that we've heard dozens of time, but without naming names, they ultimately feel toothless considering his detractors in 2009's rap game are almost incapable of being taken seriously. But even as Jay attempts to flow futuristic on self-explanatory tracks like ""Off That"", ""Already Home"", and ""A Star Is Born"", he never allows any sort of torch-passing moments-- without the credits, you'd almost completely forget actual Future of Rap guys like J. Cole, Kid Cudi, and Drake even made it to the studio. The last of which is numbingly non-committal salutation to the past 10 years of hip-hop royalty with all the insight of an Encarta entry-- yeah, Eminem was a white guy and he still got respect. Those were the times, right? We can wrangle with the moral implications of Jay-Z making a track like ""D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)"" when the very next song on Blueprint 3 has Rihanna (to say nothing of whoever's on the hook for ""Reminder""), but the singles actually gain a sort of halo effect for their familiarity, or at least giving Jay some sort of topical construct. Elsewhere, there's just such a weird vibe-- Jay-Z still sounds like himself, but for someone whose lyrics become the lingua franca of the hip-hop community for months after any of his releases, he goes vast stretches of time without saying anything remotely memorable. He's in Kingdom Come autopilot here, ""get me out of these 16 bars"" clock-punching intermittently spiked with chuckle-worthy rich rapper rhetoric (""nowadays I eat quail/ I'll probably never see jail""), pulled-from-People namedrops (""no I'm not a Jonas,"" plus a Bernie Madoff reference that we won't get into), and a ""downward dog"" coke rap that even Clipse might think twice about. Even stranger is how it invokes the title of the original Blueprint (not to mention an aborted attempt to opportunistically recall its release date), but bears no sonic resemblance to it at all. Timbaland clearly wasn't bringing his A-game here (""Reminder"" and the dumbfounding ""Venus vs. Mars"" are phoned-in from his uninspired mid-decade valley), but the other big names, even Kanye, follow suit with the most middling futurism 2004 had to offer, or the kind of Vegas schmaltz that make all those Sinatra at the opera lines uncomfortably trenchant-- the piledriver hooks of ""Run This Town"" and ""Empire State of Mind"" are content to annoy their way to ubiquity, but the cheesed-out synths of Â­""So Ambitious"" clearly demonstrates the difference between ""ft. Pharrell"" and ""produced by the Neptunes."" I guess we should've brought up ""Young Forever"" earlier, and the answer to your question is ""Alphaville, not Rod Stewart,"" and done completely straight-faced by Mr. Hudson. So menopausal and trite that it makes ""Beach Chair"" sound like ""Streets Is Watching"", Jay-Z rounds out Blueprint 3 with a gaggle of self-help bromides-- ""just a picture perfect day that lasts a whole lifetime/ And it never ends because all we have to do is hit rewind."" It's only passable as next-level reverse psychology, inspiring a demand of another Jay-Z album in spite of how godawful Blueprint 3 is, just as long as ""Young Forever"" isn't the last song we hear from him. But in the end, Jay-Z's probably right about his claim this year that hip-hop could learn a thing or two from indie rock, even if he's purposefully vague about what that actually means. Should rappers start booking studio time with, like, Nico Muhly? Well, there's always Late Registration. Talk a good game about making ""experimental albums,"" like Jay's doing already? 808s & Heartbreak. Is Jay-Z really the kind of guy who should be telling rappers to think differently about building a fanbase when his only mixtape was created to sell a shoe? Because from its roster of producers and guest spots to its elaborate marketing, Blueprint 3 is the kind of stuck-on-stupid, event-driven money pit that proves while Jay-Z's at a point where he's got no one to answer to but himself, he's still capable of an entire hour of failing to take his own advice.","More Blueprint 2 than Blueprint, Jay-Z's latest is actually closer to Kingdom Come than either of those others.

Heartbeat Radio,Sondre Lerche,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f99d034d5c69bf3415/1:1/w_160/67a193ae.jpg,2009-09-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13426-heartbeat-radio/,Rounder,"Heartbeat Radio is the sixth proper album from Norwegian transplant Sondre Lerche, following 2007's soundtrack album for the Steve Carell sapfest Dan in Real Life. As much as that film deserves to be looped infinitely in In-Flight Movie Hell, it kind of made perfect sense to peg Lerche to handle the tunes, most of which happily remained congruent with his ever-wistful, singer-songwriter romanticism. True, this stuff can get downright schmaltzy at times, but there's such a genuineness in his music that it's hardly worth aggressively faulting the guy for it-- cynics: take heed. Nevertheless, he has the good sense to pay close attention to arrangements and general songcraft on Heartbeat Radio, reinforcing his pleasant earnestness sufficiently enough that the heartsick sunniness sticks with you all afternoon, even when the actual songs themselves don't always do the same. What saves most of Heartbeat Radio from becoming too aware of itself is Lerche's deft ear for composition that, when he sticks to the script, often benefits him greatly. Grandiose opener ""Good Luck"" wouldn't be much more than half-assed Coldplay bombast, but the wild strings egg on a fortuitous build that sets an exciting tone for the rest of the album. Title track ""Heartbeat Radio"" follows, confirming Lerche's fondness for Belle and Sebastian-- unfortunately, the energy isn't channeled properly, leaving the track sounding like a spazzy Dear Catastrophe Waitress outtake. But cuts like the following ""I Cannot Let You Go"" are so crisp and immediately tuneful it's easy to ignore the quirkier missteps. Shakers, bright acoustic guitars, and great little piano accents play so simply and delightfully on ""Let You Go"", you wonder why the guy even bothered to hire all those viola and cello players. Still, those string accompaniments are pretty sharp. Not only are the players solid, but Lerche knows just where to place them. ""Like Lazenby""-- an ordinary little ballad with a strange ""take me back"" metaphor involving ""the second James Bond"" George Lazenby-- successfully morphs into a lush slice of garden pop with the addition of those swooning strings. Even on such well rounded, unapologetically Beatles-indebted fare like ""Words & Music"" and ""Guess It's Gonna Rain Today"", the strings are what you end up taking away with you. (There's nothing coy about Lerche's Fab Four flirtations-- most of the songs found here owe a great deal to the band's mid-to-late-1960s studio output.) Not everything here is salvageable, like the irritatingly sugary ""If Only"" and the meandering closer ""Goodnight"". When there is no melodic hook and arrangements become prototypical, all you are really left with is Lerche himself and his Confessions of a Teenage Romantic thing. It nearly tarnishes the stronger cuts on repeat listenings, his cutesy, dry delivery drawing further to the front, his lyricism more apparently banal and dopey. Even if a lot of Heartbeat Radio is affable and politely poppy, a lot of it is so pointedly bland that you can't help but wonder if the good stuff stands out only because of the beige filler around it. That, or you've let your inner-cynic get the best of you. So if it seems to be a nice enough day outside and you're not feeling particularly sinister, Heartbeat Radio should suffice nicely for a little while.","Again paying close attention toÂ arrangements and general songcraft, theÂ Norwegian transplantÂ reinforces his pleasant earnestness.

Mister Pop,The Clean,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e4ea9e61561daa5242/1:1/w_160/641520a9.jpg,2009-09-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13423-mister-pop/,Merge,"Ah, the Clean-- the Halley's Comet of indie-rock, appearing after prolonged absences in a flash of brilliance, only to disappear just as quickly and practically be forgotten about. But if the New Zealand trio's output has been notoriously sporadic over their 32-year lifespan, their releases have been fortuitously timed to capitalize on their unyielding influence: After a brief string of legend-making singles in the early 1980s, the band's relatively prolific 1990-96 run coincided with the ascendance of Clean acolytes Pavement and Yo La Tengo; their last release, 2001's Getaway, dovetailed with the Strokes and the Shins' back-to-basics ethos; while the new Mister Pop-- only their fifth full-length release-- arrives at a time when a new generation of lo-fidelity all-stars (Jay Reatard, Bradford Cox, Crystal Stilts, Love Is All) is displaying a voracious appetite for Kiwi pop. But the Clean have always exuded a casual grace that suggests they'd still be making the same records even if no one was listening, employing the same set of devices-- ramshackle locomotive rhythms, buoyant basslines, swirling organ lines, and wide-smile melodies-- irrespective of prevailing fashions, technological developments, or geopolitical unrest. And yet, the Clean's periodic resurgences serve as a reminder that, in a world of uncertainty, there are still some things you can rely on. Despite the eight-year layoff since Getaway, Mister Pop effectively picks up right where we left off, with a pair of warm-up exercises-- the metronomic organ-grinding jam ""Loog"" and the possibly self-referential dream-pop ditty ""Are You Really on Drugs?""-- that feel like vapor-trail echoes of its predecessor's distended, psychedelic haze. Even in light of the Clean's lo-fi legacy, the tracks feel demo-grade, built on single ideas that, while lasting only three minutes each, still feel run into the ground, begging the question of whether eight years was actually long enough for the song reservoir to replenish itself again. But such quibbles are cast aside 30 seconds into ""In the Dreamlife You Need a Rubber Soul"", a headlight-bright jangle-pop pleaser (possibly about the new Beatles reissues?) that boasts all the hallmarks of classic Clean. On another track, David Kilgour makes an even more explicit reinforcement of Mister Pop's return-to-form intent: over a paisley-toned, mod-rock swing, he repeats, ""It puts me right back in the day."" And so Mister Pop stays the course for the rest of its relatively compact 10-song, 34-minute length, reshaping the Clean's core components into poignant bossa nova instrumentals (""Simple Fix""), propulsive Krautrock-outs (""Tensile"") and, as only they can, bizarro fuzz-organ jigs that resemble White Light/White Heat-era Velvets auditioning for ""Riverdance"" (""Moonjumper""). But whenever Mister Pop threatens to drift off, it's grounded by an ace-in-the-hole strummer like ""Factory Man"", a Go-Betweens-worthy working-class-hero portrait that, rather than comment on the blue-collar life from an artist's distance, sees a kinship. ""He's a factory man/ And I'm no better than he 'cause I'm a factory man, too,"" Kilgour concludes. And after all these years, the Clean's assembly-line craftsmanship is as well-oiled as ever.","The Kiwi Pop giants and lo-fi all-stars return with, incredibly, only the fifth LP in their storied career.

Masters of the Burial,Amy Millan,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f85e6ef95969320c15/1:1/w_160/64295fc7.jpg,2009-09-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13437-masters-of-the-burial/,Arts & Crafts,"Amy Millan has an evocative whisper of a voice, but it is best served when bolstered by collaborators. In Stars she plays the tart, girlish counterpoint to Torquil Campbell's Morrissey-loving drama queen, grounding his theatrical tenor in realism on their bubbly, synthesizer-kissed pop. And in Broken Social Scene she is part of the crowd, one of a trio of shivery voiced women who add emotional hooks to the collective's often cerebral, atmospheric sound. On her own, however, she lacks heft. On her second woodsy solo album she admits as much by loading the collection with covers-- four of the 11 tracks are remakes on this 31-minute record. Which is a shame because, even though the album is slight, it is quite pretty, thanks to its lush, intimate production. Despite the padding. Millan's originals are the best parts of Masters of the Burial. ""Low Sail"" flickers like a campfire with its warm strings and understated pedal steel melting under the repeated, lissome-fingered acoustic guitar arpeggio. ""Lost Compass"", over too soon at less than two-minutes-long, turns a smoky ode to feverish sexual desire into a spare, acoustic waltz. And ""Day to Day"" distinguishes itself as a practically a cappella endeavor. With just some tinny percussion-- which sounds partly like a sampled live drumline and partly like a fuzzy programmed drum machine-- to bolster her own feathery tones, the emphasis is placed squarely on Millan's best musical feature: her honeyed-twilight voice. On her last solo outing, 2006's Honey From the Tombs, Millan presented herself as a cowgirl-chanteuse, drowning her sorrows in whiskey and Emmylou Harris records. But though it is torchy and folksy, this collection mostly eschews that vibe-- the most notable exception being album closer ""Bound"", which dosados with fiddle flourishes, pedal steel, and the Canadian singer's valiant attempt at Southern twang as she sings lines about ""the fussin', the fightin', the boozin', [and] the cryin'"". Millan's taste in covers is eccentric, running the gamut from the obscure (""Old Perfume"" by defunct Canadian rockers Weeping Tile) to the expected (""Day to Day"" by Jenny Whiteley whose ""Baby I"" was the lone cover on Honey From the Tombs). Her version of Richard Hawley's ""Run for Me"" is a surprising success, though, with her feminine murmur adding new depth to a song that originally hinged on its British songwriter's growling, masculine delivery. And while Millan's version of Death Cab for Cutie's ""I Will Follow You Into The Dark"" is handsome enough with its keening pedal steel and kettle-steam harmonies, it feels unnecessary. Did we really need another version of Death Cab's love-and-death theme song? The original is more than mawkish enough. Overall, the gauzy prettiness of the collection, its initial strength, can get boring, and things never manage to heat up beyond a low simmer. Without Campbell to up the dramatic stakes or other Broken Social Scenesters to quirk up the percussion or rouse the dynamics, Millan sounds bland.

Break Up,Scarlett JohanssonPete Yorn,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fbc0084474cd0c0855/1:1/w_160/05a1bb00.jpg,2009-09-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13415-break-up/,RhinoAtco,"Scarlett Johansson, the musician, has a way of getting herself into impossible situations. Like, I dunno, making her official recording debut with a version of jazz standard ""Summertime"". Joining a reunited Jesus and Mary Chain onstage at Coachella. Taking on the Tom Waits songbook. Covering Jeff Buckley's ""Last Goodbye"" for a romantic comedy based on a self-help book. Or owning the lips that inspired Katy Perry's ""I Kissed a Girl"". Um, I guess that last one isn't really Johansson's fault. Add to the list: Putting out an album inspired by the 1960s duets of Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot. Especially when the unkempt male in question is Pete Yorn, who had an unfairly panned sleeper of a debut album back in the David Gray era, then followed it with the kind of blandly forgettable slump that made a lot of people wonder why they ever liked either of those guys in the first place. On last year's Anywhere I Lay My Head, Waits' songs and producer David Sitek's woozy 4AD-style majesty would've made for an intriguing listen even if Johansson had been awful (she totes wasn't). Break Up, by contrast, resembles a Yorn album: nine tracks of tastefully beige, electronics-brushed roots-rock. Suddenly, Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward's collaboration as She & Him sounds like The Velvet Underground & Nico. In a way, it's a shame Yorn ever started making comparisons to classic ""guy-girl"" duos at all. If you take Break Up for what it is-- a low-key project recorded with little preparation in a couple of afternoons three years ago-- then the set has its charms. First single ""Relator"", for one, with its buzzing instrumental hook and breezy acoustic shuffle, is engagingly playful Rushmore fodder, only a White Stripes credit away from a spot on way too many year-end lists. When Yorn goes uptempo again, with the weeping guitar fills and crisp drum machines of ""Blackie's Dead"", he comes up with more of the blankly catchy hooks that propelled him to stardom. The song even ends with a mildly satisfying twist: ""Darlin', you're forgiven/ I don't like what's goin' on."" That's right: In case you couldn't tell from the name, Break Up is about two characters who gradually find themselves in an impossible situation of their own. This conceit means just that much more extra-musical baggage for the skeptics out there to overlook. But as you might expect, it happens to suit Johansson. When she's able to sing closer to her natural, deeper range, as on a vaguely futuristic cover of late Big Star member Chris Bell's 1978 single ""I Am the Cosmos"", the husky creak in her voice would demand attention even if you didn't know her from Kirsten Dunst. But the same song is also one of the main instances where Quincy Jones grandson Sunny Levine's generally background-friendly production starts to get in the way, all vwerping bass and annoying tick-tocks. On predictable country-rocker ""I Don't Know What to Do"", complete with honky-tonk piano, how much fun Johansson is having beams right through lyrics clouded with confusion and doubt. It's nobody's fault that She & Him's fine Volume One came out first, but the girl-next-door quality, like the usually higher vocal register, suits the glamorous Johansson less than it would the more approachable Deschanel. And that's when Johansson isn't buried in the mix: On banjo-rock plodder ""Wear and Tear"", she gets in barely a few backing words, while on bossa nova-tinged ""Shampoo"", Levine's stereo-panned electronic sounds-- twinkling in one channel, crunching in the other-- communicate the couple's disconnect better than anything in their dull dialogue (Johansson: ""Run away""; Yorn: ""I'd go anywhere with you""). Even on ""Relator"", Johansson's voice is crammed into the same kind of telephone-style filter that Yorn used to more memorable effect on 2001 single ""Life on a Chain"". Yorn's story really isn't as different from Johansson's as you might think. His first big break came through the movies, too, when ""Strange Condition"" (later re-recorded with R.E.M.'s Peter Buck) landed on the soundtrack to 2000 Farrelly Brothers film Me, Myself & Irene. Nor is Break Up Yorn's first collaboration with a female singer. He previously worked with the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines on ""The Man"", an otherwise pretty typical Yorn midtempo strummer from his rock-leaning 2006 album, Nightcrawler. More recently, Yorn-- like Johansson-- has turned to veterans from the world of indie rock, working with Saddle Creek producer Mike Mogis on this year's cleverly titled Back and Fourth. Still, ""Relator"" aside, there's little about this duo's chemistry that lives up to Matt and Kim, let alone Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. ""The memory fades away,"" Yorn sings in that faded Ryan Adams whisper on Break Up's sorrowful finale, ""Someday"". Their album is better than the knee-jerk beauty haters will tell you, but it rarely has the tunes or emotional impact to make it one of those rare impossible situations you'll actually want to remember. Breaking up shouldn't be this hard to do.","Continuing her high-wire act of a musical career, ScarJo follows her trip into the Tom Waits songbook withÂ an album inspired by 1960sÂ Gainsbourg/BardotÂ duets.

The Stone Roses,The Stone Roses,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54b5e6ef95969320a88/1:1/w_160/342d172e.jpg,2009-09-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13449-the-stone-roses/,Sony,"Surly, sullen and fearsomely confident in shaggy hair and baggy jeans, frontman Ian Brown declared on the Stone Roses' eponymous album, ""I am the resurrection and I am the light,""Â connecting with a nation of acid-house damaged kids eager to believeÂ in something. As it happens, Brown's arrogance was misplaced and the band's rock stardom a lot shorter-lived than anyone expected.Â The Stone Roses made a stunning debut, then bled out in a slow agony of contractual disputes, internal discord, and, eventually, public indifference (though their sophomore release and swan song,Â Second Coming, is nowhere near as bad as people say). More prosaic than drugs or young death, this trifecta killed a career that now essentially consists ofÂ just one great record. But the story ofÂ The Stone Roses is really a tale of two records, divided by an ocean.Â As Sony (which now owns original label Silvertone) rolls out a remastered version in celebration of the album's 20th anniversary, Brits wrestle with what's become a cultural crucible. When a record's aura or associations, rather than its content, begins dominating discussions-- especially when a nation routinely votes it one of rock history's best-- clothing-deprived-emperor jive usually isn't far behind. And the fact that the former idols have had the bad grace to survive into their forties and release a string of middling yet well-promoted solo albums hasn't boosted theÂ The Stone Roses'Â reputation at home. We Americans are relatively unencumbered (though it'll be fun to see ifÂ Nevermind incites as much hair-tearing when itÂ hits 20 in two years). The Roses, and the ""Madchester"" scene with which they were loosely associated, never translated to the U.S. beyond modern rock radio and late-night MTV. They also failed to hugely impact an underground hostile to anything that implied feet were made for more than propping up a body so it could sip beer and look bored. Many prominent American critics didn't champion the Roses, either.Â ""What do [the Stone Roses] do that the Byrds or Buffalo Springfield didn't do better in 1967?"" Robert Christgau wondered in TheÂ Village Voice, typifying the Boomer establishment's predictable position on a band of GenXers cheeky enough to remind them, ""the past was yours, but the future's mine."" To answer Christgau's question, what the Stone Roses did better was marry smart psychedelic pop to dance grooves in an incredibly accessible and powerful way that appealed both to rock and rave fans, lovers of hooks and beats, punks and people who actually welcomed 10-minute guitar solos. If influence matters, the album influenced scores of other bands, including Spiritualized, Primal Scream (which bassist Mani joined after the Roses collapsed), the Manic Street Preachers, the Beta Band, the Libertines, and, as the Gallagher brothers have never missed an opportunity to assert, Oasis. And unlike most of the Madchester bands, the Roses weren'tÂ only about a sound, a vibe, or a scene. They owned a clutch of insanely catchy, emotionally nuanced, lyrically astute songs about love, lust, youth, and raging ambition that didn't require a historical context to understand or embrace. Exploding the false dichotomy of album band/singles band,Â The Stone Roses is a logical, cohesive album made up of incredible stand-alone songs. To wit, ""She Bangs the Drums"", ""Waterfall"", ""Made of Stone"", ""(Song for My) Sugar Spun Sister"", and ""Fool's Gold"" (a later single that was appended to the original U.S. release and, unlike fellow longtime U.S. add-on ""Elephant Stone"", reappears on the reissue), would make stellar radio hits in any decade. Brown's vocals, guitarist John Squire's intricate fingerwork and mighty riffs, and rhythm section Mani and Reni's sly, lockstepping grooves, are a textbook case of the whole far exceeding its components. Even ""Elizabeth, My Dear"", a notorious monarchy smackdown set to ""Scarborough Faire""'s half-millennium-old melody, was ballsy then and remains deliciously tart today. But queen-bashing and other acts of symbolic resistance aside (""Bye Bye Badman"" and Squire's abstract expressionist cover art reference the 1968 student protests that uprooted France's political and cultural establishments),Â The Stone Roses isn't aÂ radical, or even particularly progressive, work: From its verse-chorus-verses, to its meticulous overdubs and careful sequencing, to its revival-- however cleverly repurposed-- of hoary old rock myths (""I don't have to sell my soul/ He's already in me""), the album is a slick production designed for maximum market penetration. And for something that signaled a generational handoff, it's awfully invested in the previous generation's specious valorization of The Album, not to mention the hippie values inscribed in psychedeliaÂ (on this point at least, Christgau was correct). Nobody, therefore, need be put out by Sony's splashy remarketing campaign. The 20th anniversary edition is available in four formats, from a standard single CD or vinyl set to a $120 ""collector's"" box of four discs, four vinyl LPs, and such extras as signed prints of Squire's artwork, a lemon-shaped USB, wallpaper, and ringtones. I can't recommend dipping into your rent money to buy that thing, but $30 for theÂ elegantly designed deluxe edition, which includes the remastered album, a disc of demos, a DVD with live footage and videos (most of which are lame pastiches of said live footage), and a booklet ofÂ band member reminiscences, seems fair to fans. Largely lacking the funk that snuck into the studio, the demos are still a phenomenal bunch of tunes (including some that didn't make final cut) that should finally put to rest rumors that the Roses were nobodies who came out of nowhere. The demos also officially confirm that, left to his own devices, Brown sings about as well as you do on a shit-faced midnight karaoke dare. But hey, he cleans up nicely. In fact, Brown's brooding, beautiful self-harmonies on the album may be one of producer John Leckie'sÂ finest achievements. Leckie teamed up with Brown to remaster the LP, which, produced at the tail-end of the vinyl era, lacked some range at the low end and suffered from its tin-timbred late-80s drum sound, among other issues. Now, the infamous bassline that opens ""I Wanna Be Adored"" has an even more thrilling anticipatory deep-earth rumble; instead of slaps, ""She Bangs the Drums""' beats pack actual punches; and the originally muddy textures of a song like ""Made of Stone"" are brighter and broader-spectrumed, with crisp chiming guitars and lustrous basslines. The record industry has whipped itself into a frenzy of last-ditch, cash-grabbing CD reissues lately, but the originalÂ Stone Roses actually merited a sound overhaul. And the results are brilliant, further supporting the case for classic album status-- if support's needed.","A badly needed remaster of this landmark LP sounds even fresher than it did 20 years ago-- and thanks to Sony there are now loads of expensive ways to hear it.

Past Masters,The Beatles,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c59d034d5c69bf338e/1:1/w_160/dde97f67.jpg,2009-09-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13408-past-masters/,EMIEMI,"Past Masters is the ugly but brilliant sibling of the Beatles discography. Originally released as two separate discs in 1988, it's a catchall for all the stuff the Beatles officially released during their existence that wasn't intended for their albums (and didn't end up on the after-the-fact album Magical Mystery Tour). It's slapped together chronologically, so it begins with an unprepossessing alternate take of ""Love Me Do"" and ends with the ludicrous doodle ""You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)"". And, between them, it includes some of the best pop songs ever recorded-- scratch that: some of the best pop singles ever recorded. It can be hard to grasp the way it used to work if you've grown up with the basic unit of pop music as the album or the individual song, but the model the Beatles grew up with-- and arguably broke-- was the 45 RPM single: two songs sold together, one of them aspiring to popular success and the other one a sort of lagniappe. They treated their own singles not just as hit-plus-filler but as an often-complementary pair: the massive humanist crescendo of ""Hey Jude"" paired with the corrective political fireball of ""Revolution"", the frantic urgency of ""Paperback Writer"" paired with the dreamy involution of ""Rain"", John Lennon's bitter, betrayed ""Day Tripper"" paired with Paul McCartney's hopeful, clear-eyed ""We Can Work It Out"". For that matter, their singles weren't simply teasers for an album: Of the 22 singles (and two EPs) the Beatles released in the UK between 1962 and 1970, more than half weren't initially part of a bigger unit. Their first non-album single, ""From Me to You"", came out all of three weeks after Please Please Me; ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" emerged a week after With the Beatles. ""Day Tripper""/""We Can Work It Out"" was actually released-- as a double A-side-- the same day as Rubber Soul, on which neither side appeared. By that point, they were basically just showing off. Most of the first disc of Past Masters is the product the Beatles were being pushed to crank out over the first three years of their recording career: The three-covers-and-a-leftover Long Tall Sally EP, German recordings of a couple of hits, a version of Larry Williams' ""Bad Boy"" that filled out an American LP. It also features the two phenomenal, headlong late 1963 singles that transformed them from a perfectly nice Liverpool band to The Goddamn Beatles: ""She Loves You"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". It's a testament to the Beatles' gamechanging originality that the opportunistic American bands who tried to make a few bucks by covering those songs over the following few months couldn't even play them right-- the harmonies of ""She Loves You"" and the delicious rhythmic trick that introduces ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" flummoxed every one of them. The astonishing stuff continues on the second disc: seven A-side/B-side pairs, plus an alternate version of John's devotional ""Across the Universe"". ""Paperback Writer""/""Rain"" was the single where they moved away from their great subject of love, and where Ringo Starr perfected his uncanny ability to shift the beat just enough that the band seemed to be hovering a few inches above the ground. George Harrison's ""The Inner Light""-- a spaced-out setting from the Tao Te Ching, on which he's backed up by Indian musicians-- is a momentum-killer in the context of an album (as it is here), but it made sense as part of a yin-and-yang pair with Paul's earthy Fats Domino homage ""Lady Madonna"". ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"", rushed out seven weeks after ""Get Back"", looked like a colossal act of vanity on its surface-- John messing with the Lennon/McCartney copyright juggernaut by reporting so literally on what he'd been up to for the past couple of months that the result was basically impossible to cover, and getting Paul into the studio to bang it out with him, even though Ringo and George were due back in town just a few days later. It's a triumph, anyway. As usual with their singles, there's something new and ear-catching jumping out of the speakers every few seconds (the shaker that doubles the rhythm right after the bridge, Paul's improvised-sounding last-word-of-each-line harmonies, John singing ""Gibraltar near Spain"" at a moment when that was a political assertion), and honestly Lennon had been having a pretty interesting spring. And then there's their biggest-selling single and deepest pairing of songs, ""Hey Jude""/""Revolution"". McCartney is singing about Lennon's son, Lennon is shouting about the system and culture about which they're embedded; ""Jude"" wraps its arms around the world and gets everyone to join in its mantra, ""Revolution"" pushes the idiots away with the nastiest noise the Beatles had ever made. It was also the first release on the Beatles' own label, Apple Records-- or, rather, one of two singles that came out the same day. (The other was Mary Hopkin's ""Those Were the Days"", which knocked it off the top of the British charts after a couple of weeks.) As a seven-minute song on an album of three-minute songs, ""Hey Jude"" inevitably overpowers its context; as a free-floating sound file without ""Revolution"", it's missing the sting that tempers its sweetness. But if you find yourself taking advantage of the reissue-and-""Rock Band"" frenzy to sit down and really listen to the magnificent recordings that have spent the last four decades or so as inescapable background music, remember the way much of these two discs were meant to be heard and understood: two by two.

Let It Be,The Beatles,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5eb13d1975652139084/1:1/w_160/a6e2b2b7.jpg,2009-09-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13430-let-it-be/,EMIEMI,"As the 1960s wound down, so did the Beatles. The symmetry was perfect: youthful energy, optimism, and camaraderie had given over to cynicism, discord, and looking out for number one. As the decade's final year began, the White Album was still riding high on the charts and the Yellow Submarine soundtrack was days away from release. But the Beatles were in serious trouble. Nothing about being in the band was enjoyable or easy. The power vacuum left by the death of manager Brian Epstein a year and a half earlier had never been satisfactorily filled; Apple Corps, the multi-media company started by the band a year earlier, was bleeding money; and toughest of all, the once-Fab Four didn't generally enjoy being in the same room together. All were either married or close to it, closing in on 30, and tremendously weary of all they'd been through. Paul McCartney, the most devoted of the gang to the notion of the Beatles (Ringo Starr called him the ""Beatleaholic""), thought that the group needed a special project to bring it together. Another White Album-style scenario, with the songwriters in the band working alone in separate studios, enlisting each other to serve as a de facto backup band, was bound to fail. Too much good will and trust had been lost. They needed something big they could all submit to. Several ideas were proposed, most involving a return of some kind to live performance: perhaps a live album of new songs or a huge show in a remote place; maybe the band would charter an ocean liner and make an album on it. Ultimately, it was decided that the band would be filmed on a soundstage rehearsing for a show and developing material for a new album-- a document of the Beatles at work. The theme for the project would be back-to-basics, a return of the group as a performing unit, sans overdubs, emphasizing their inherent musicality. Working title: Get Back. It was an awful idea. First, no one was sure exactly what he was supposed to be doing. Glyn Johns was there, a new presence behind the boards, but he never quite figured out if he was producing or just engineering. Regular producer George Martin was technically on board, but his participation was minimal. While Let It Be was initially meant to be a return to simplicity, Phil Spector's later involvement (he was brought in to ""reproduce"" the tracks, adding extra voices and instruments to thicken arrangements and remix the record, a decision made without McCartney's input) killed that angle. Organizational chaos aside, the sessions were painful. We all know what it feels like to be around people we don't like for days on end; if reality television has taught us anything, it's that a camera crew in a room full of such people does nothing to ease tension. The time the Beatles spent recording and filming was described by all as supremely unpleasant, despite a later uptick when they'd returned to finish up at Abbey Road. And when they finished, no one really liked what they'd laid down on tape. So not surprisingly, the essential nature of Let It Be is that it feels incomplete and fragmented; it's a difficult album to peg because the Beatles were never sure themselves what they wanted it to be. So the best way to approach it is as a collection of songs by guys who still were churning out classics with some regularity. It may not succeed on the level of the Beatles' previous albums, but there's enough good material to make it a worthy entry in their canon. Outside of the title track, there's little here that feels consequential to the Beatles' legacy. The easy acoustic shuffle of the John Lennon and Paul McCartney duet ""Two of Us"" has appeal, though, as do the prickly rhythmic drive of George Harrison's ""For You Blue"" and the bubbling Booker T-isms of McCartney's ""Get Back"". The swampy ""I've Got a Feeling"", possibly reflecting McCartney's recent interest in Canned Heat, is intriguing because it sounds so classic rock 70s. And Lennon's ""Across the Universe"", recorded during the White Album sessions and sounding like it was beamed in from somewhere else, has a certain ringing brilliance. For balance, there's ""Dig a Pony"" and the boogieing ""One After 909"", the latter actually written by Lennon and McCartney as kids in the fifties. Still, for plenty of good bands, the best of these would be career highlights. Recorded without joy, set aside for months while a better album was assembled, and finally remixed in a way that enraged one of the band's principals, Let It Be finally saw release in May 1970. But by that point, the Beatles break-up had been official for several weeks. There's since been a live album, compilations, digitization, trolls through the archives, and an ocean of ink spilled about this little band that made it very big. And now there are these CD issues, done beautifully. But there never was a proper reunion, and we can assume that there will never be another Beatles.

Abbey Road,The Beatles,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5eec0084474cd0c0835/1:1/w_160/65b0f679.jpg,2009-09-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13431-abbey-road/,EMIEMI,"One more ""like we used to"" was how Paul McCartney framed it to producer George Martin; a chance to make a ""good album"" was George Harrison's take. They were hoping to bounce back after the serious downer that had been the Get Back sessions, which, months after they wrapped, had yet to yield an album anyone was happy with. But what ""like we used to"" meant, exactly, was rather hard to pin down: The Beatles' life as a band was so compressed, with such a massive amount of music and change packed into a short time, that there was never a single moment that could be used as a reference point for what a Beatles record was supposed to be. So when they returned to the EMI studios on Abbey Road in summer 1969, it wasn't clear how it would go. They still weren't getting along; their musical interests continued to diverge; John Lennon didn't really want to continue with the Beatles; Paul McCartney did, but on his own terms, which meant that he set the pace and got what he wanted. Though it was unspoken, they all had a good idea that this could really be the end. So what now? One more, then. And what a finish. The Beatles' story is so enduring in part because it was wrapped up so perfectly. Abbey Road shows a band still clearly in its prime, capable of songwriting and recording feats other groups could only envy. Working for the first time exclusively on an eight-track tape machine, their mastery of the studio was undeniable, and Abbey Road still sounds fresh and exciting 40 years on (indeed, of the 2009 remasters, the improvements and sonic detail here are the most striking). Even if it's ultimately the Paul McCartney and George Martin show, as demonstrated on the famous second-side medley, everyone brought his A-game. Where Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band strained for significance, The Beatles was schizophrenic, and Let It Be was a drag streaked with greatness, Abbey Road lays out its terms precisely and meets them all. There's not a duff note on the damn thing. This applies even if, like me, you've never quite understood the attraction of John Lennon's ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and sometimes find yourself skipping ahead to George Harrison's second-side lead-off ""Here Comes the Sun"". ""I Want You"" is certainly a singular item in the Beatles discography, with its extreme repetition, stark simplicity, and epic three-minute coda, but it requires a certain kind of mood to appreciate. Yet, along with album-opener ""Come Together"", it also shows how Lennon finally found a way to square his latter-day interest in leaner and edgier rock'n'roll with trippy studio experimentation. Lennon's two big songs on the first side are raw, direct, and biting, but they're also lush studio creations, in keeping with the spirit of the album. And the sophisticated sheen laid over top has the effect of making them seem more like ""Beatles songs"" compared to, say, Lennon's White Album output. Abbey Road feels like one thing. Paul McCartney's ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and Ringo Starr's ""Octopus's Garden"", two silly, charming, childlike songs in a long tradition of silly, charming, childlike Beatles songs, round out side one. But then, oh: side two. The suite that runs from ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" through ""Her Majesty"" finds the Beatles signing off in grand fashion. Gathering scraps of material that had piled up, McCartney and Martin pieced together a song cycle bursting with light and optimism, and this glorious stretch of music seems to singlehandedly do away with the bad vibes that had accumulated over the previous two years. From the atmospheric rip of Fleetwood Mac's ""Albatross"" that is ""Sun King"" to the sharp pair of Lennon fragments, ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" and ""Polythene Pam"" (the former given a line about ""sister Pam"" to join the pieces), and on through the explosive, one-climax-after-another run of ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"", ""Golden Slumbers"", and ""Carry That Weight"", the nine fragments in 16 minutes add up to so much more than the sum of their parts. The music is tempered with uncertainly and longing, suggestive of adventure, reflecting a sort of vague wisdom; it's wistful, earnest music that also feels deep, even though it really isn't. But above all it just feels happy and joyous, an explosion of warm feeling rendered in sound. And then, the perfect capper, finishing with a song called ""The End"", which features alternating guitar solos from John, George, and Paul and a drum solo from Ringo. It was an ideal curtain call from a band that just a few years earlier had been a bunch of punk kids from a nowheresville called Liverpool with more confidence than skill. This is how you finish a career. The Beatles' run in the 1960s is good fodder for thought experiments. For example, Abbey Road came out in late September 1969. Though Let It Be was then still unreleased, the Beatles wouldn't record another album together. But they were still young men: George was 26 years old, Paul was 27, John was 28, and Ringo was 29. The Beatles' first album, Please Please Me, had come out almost exactly six and a half years earlier. So if Abbey Road had been released today, Please Please Me would date to March 2003. So think about that for a sec: Twelve studio albums and a couple of dozen singles, with a sound that went from earnest interpreters of Everly Brothers and Motown hits to mind-bending sonic explorers and with so many detours along the way-- all of it happened in that brief stretch of time. That's a weight to carry.

Yellow Submarine,The Beatles,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ecea9e61561daa5256/1:1/w_160/3ff0bc0a.jpg,2009-09-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13429-yellow-submarine/,EMIEMI,"Hey, nobody's perfect. The only truly minor album in the Beatles' catalogue isn't really an album at all. Yellow Submarine, released in January 1969, is the soundtrack to the feature-length cartoon of the same name, a project with which the Beatles had little involvement. The idea of an animated film stretched back to 1965, but these were busy years for the band, and the project was pushed to the backburner. Once the movie finally got underway in 1967, the Beatles had no real interest in the details. In one sense, the Yellow Submarine project is the opposite of Magical Mystery Tour. While the latter film was derided as pretentious and incoherent, the Yellow Submarine feature was well-received. And while the record releases associated with Magical Mystery Tour are of staggeringly high quality, the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered. Brian Epstein had died in August, and with him gone, there was little motivation for the Beatles to participate in any meaningful way. So actors mimicked their voices, their input into the story consisted of a meeting or two with the filmmakers, and when it came time to assemble the soundtrack, they combed through the vault to see what was left over. Of the six tracks by the Beatles on the album's first side, two, ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""All You Need Is Love"", are already familiar from their original contexts (as part of Revolver and as a single, respectively). The other four were holdovers from sessions in 1967 (Paul McCartney's ""All Together Now"", George Harrison's ""It's All Too Much"" and ""It's Only a Northern Song"") and 1968 (John Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog""). They never found release during the time they were recorded because, well, they weren't good enough. Granted, we're talking about a time when the Beatles were making some of the finest pop albums of all time, so the question of what constitutes ""good enough"" is relative. But even setting aside their exceedingly high standards, this lot is pretty middling, if certainly still enjoyable. Neither of Harrison's songs ranks with his best. ""Only a Northern Song"" and ""It's All Too Much"" are filled with swirling psychedelic production-- tooting horns, backward instruments, shimmering percussion-- but beneath the din there's not much else interesting going on. ""Only a Northern Song"" at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company (i.e., no matter what Harrison wrote for this particular number, it belonged to Northern Songs, Ltd.). But ""It's All Too Much"" stretches on for an endless six and a half minutes, the constipated production in fruitless search of a tune. For McCartney's part, ""All Together Now"" is a cheery and pleasant sing-along befitting an animated soundtrack, and Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog"" is a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, by a good margin the best song here. They might be second-rate Beatles songs, but still. To round out the album, the second side of Yellow Submarine is filled with George Martin's score for the film. Pieces like ""Pepperland"", ""Sea of Holes"", and ""March of the Meanies"", however they were received at the time, function now primarily as garish kitsch, lushly orchestrated orchestral music that could have come from anywhere. Personally, I can enjoy this stuff when I'm in the mood. The blandly anonymous but beautifully recorded swoop of strings, self-consciously ""exotic"" percussion, and recurring thematic motifs serve as an intriguing sort of time capsule of a time when light ""beautiful music"" still commanded the ears of a sizeable listening pubic. But it's very easy to forget that the music has anything to do with the Beatles, or even popular music of the last 50 years, at least until the ""Yellow Submarine"" melody returns in ""Yellow Submarine in Pepperland"". As a souvenir of the film, Yellow Submarine has its place, and in fairness, it was never intended as a major release. But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.

The Beatles,The Beatles,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ef5e6ef95969320bfd/1:1/w_160/9955e3fd.jpg,2009-09-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/,EMIEMI,"In his review of the Beatles' 1963 LP debut, Please Please Me, Tom Ewing pointed out that whether or not you consider them to be the best band of the rock'n'roll era, they certainly have the quintessential pop band story. Everything they did is deeply embedded in rock's DNA, and the band's offhand and ad-hoc gestures have long been established parts of pop music mythology. And of the Beatles' albums, none-- not even Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band-- rivals The Beatles as a rock archetype. The phrase, ""It's like their White Album""-- applied to records like Prince's Sign o' the Times, HÃ¼sker DÃ¼'s Zen Arcade, the Clash's Sandinista!, and Pavement's Wowee Zowee,Â among many others-- has long been accepted critical shorthand. To use the expression is to conjure a familiar cluster of associations: The work in question is large and sprawling, overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences, and filled with a hugely variable array of material, some of which might sound great one day and silly the next. A band's White Album is also most likely assembled under a time of great stress, often resulting in an artistic peak but one that nonetheless scatters clues to its creator's eventual demise. The Beatles, the band's complex and wide-ranging double album from 1968, is all of these things. It's a glorious and flawed mess, and its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs. People love this album not because every song is a masterpiece, but because even the throwaways have their place. Even so, for the Beatles, being all over the place was a sign of trouble. The disintegration of the group as one ""thing"" is reflected in every aspect of the record, from its recording history (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison sometimes worked in separate studios on their own songs) to its production (generally spare and tending to shapeshift from one song to the next) to the arrangements of the songs (which tend to emphasize the solo voice above all). Visual changes were also apparent. Until The Beatles, the group's album artwork tended to depict the band as a unit: same haircuts, same jackets, same costumes, same artist's rendering. But The Beatles was packaged with separate individual color photos of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and they now appear almost forebodingly distinct. All of a sudden, the Beatles neither looked nor sounded like a monolith. So soon after Pepper and the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, the writing was on the wall. But the backstory of The Beatles, while fascinating, is inessential to the album's appeal. Yes, they wrote most of it in India on acoustic guitar, while on a pilgrimage of sorts in early 1968 to see the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Some of Lennon's songs, including ""Sexy Sadie"" and ""Dear Prudence"", are based directly on the group's disillusioning experiences there. But it's the spectral, floating mood of ""Prudence"" and Lennon's playful, faintly condescending vocal in ""Sadie"" that stay with you. And while we know that Lennon's new love, Yoko Ono, was a regular presence during the session, much to the rest of the band's chagrin (McCartney has claimed that she would sometimes sit on his bass amp during a take, and he'd have to ask her to scoot over to adjust the volume), and that her influence on him led to the tape collage ""Revolution 9"", the more important detail is the final one, that the biggest pop band in the world exposed millions of fans to a really great and certainly frightening piece of avant-garde art. In one sense, ""Revolution 9"" almost seems like The Beatles in microcosm: audacious, repetitive, silly, and intermittently dull, but also pulsing with life. If the individual Beatles hadn't been on such a songwriting roll during this time or if the album hadn't been sequenced and edited so well, The Beatles could easily have been an overlong slog, a Let It Be x2, say. But somehow, almost in spite of itself, it flows. The iffy jokes (""Rocky Raccoon"", ""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill"", ""Piggies"") and genre exercises (Lennon's aggro ""Yer Blues"", McCartney's pre-war pop confection ""Honey Pie"") are enjoyable, even without knowing that another gem is lurking around the next corner. If The Beatles feels more like a collection of songs by solo artists, they've also each got more going on than we'd realized. John is even more hilarious than we'd imagined, wanting nothing more than to puncture the Beatles' myth (""Glass Onion""), but he's also displaying a disconcerting willingness to deal with painful autobiography in a direct way (""Julia""). Paul's getting disarmingly soft and fluffy (""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", ""I Will""), while simultaneously writing the roughest, rawest tunes in his Beatles oeuvre (""Back in the U.S.S.R."", ""Helter Skelter""). George is finding a better way to channel his new Eastern-influenced spiritual concerns into a rock context, while his songwriting toolkit continues to expand (""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Long Long Long""). And even Ringo Starr writes a decent song, a country & western number with weirdly thick and heavy production (""Don't Pass Me By""). Listening as the tracks scroll by, there's a constant feeling of discovery. But ultimately, the thing about this record is that the Beatles sound human on it. You feel like you're really getting to know them, just as they're starting to get to know themselves. Their amazing run between the latter part of 1965 through 1967 made them seem like a band apart, infallible musical geniuses always looking for another boundary to break. Here, they fail, and pretty often, too. But by allowing for that, they somehow achieve more. White Albums come when you surrender to inspiration: you're feeling so much, so intensely, that you're not sure what it all means, and you know you'll never be able to squeeze it all in.

Rock Band,The Beatles,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f75e6ef95969320c11/1:1/w_160/f781f7bd.jpg,2009-09-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13443-rock-band/,Electronic Arts,"Here's the story of the Beatles, as told by the intro to The Beatles: Rock Band. They started as four lads in a basement club, covering Chuck Berry for hours at a stretch. Girls screamed, and the band got bigger and bigger 'til it stormed the world (specifically, America). Tours and celebrity and more screaming girls followed, until suddenly the world was a drag-- and they ascended a magic escalator to the sky, where they rode the giant elephant god Ganesha up to the edge of the creation. They became saints, or gods, or something just as sacred, and on a tablet it was written: ""You don't mess with the Beatles."" That was Harmonix's mantra going into the project. The developers knew if they were going to handle one of the biggest properties in popular culture, they would take excruciating care to make it loyal, even worshipful. The visual design is warm and adoring, and each Beatle looks gentle and kind-- especially John Lennon, who's so beatific you almost forget that George Harrison has died, too. And the Beatles dominate the game.  They're the only people on the virtual stage: Eric Clapton never plays guitar and Billy Preston and Yoko Ono are expunged. More importantly, the Beatles ignore you. Every song is shown with period dress and setting: You can't play ""Helter Skelter"" in the Cavern in Liverpool or ""Boys"" at their 1969 rooftop concert. When you screw up, the screen just fades to black. In the first few clubs, the camera regularly cuts to those girls in the audience, screaming, in love. But they're not screaming for you. You, the player, are the disciple. You're here to study the music: To play as fast and loud as the band did in its youth, to finish the delicate ""Dear Prudence"" without a single bum note, to master Paul McCartney's bass line to ""I Saw Her Standing There"" on expert. The challenge is moderate compared to other music games, and harmony vocals are the only new feature: While the Beatles used strings, tape loops, and other effects, these are all channeled through the standard four instruments (guitar, bass, drums, and mic), and playing the strings for ""I Am the Walrus"" with the guitar controller works better than you might expect.Â But the harmony vocals make it a far better party game than previous Rock Band editions.  I've played with two additional singers, a guy who likes to belt Rush and a woman who's in a choir, and listening to them chant ""GUTEN MORGEN GUTEN MORGEN GUT"" was worth the price right there. The 45-track setlist balances better-known Beatles songs (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", ""Day Tripper"") with deep cuts chosen for gameplay.  (The loping, sad ""Dig a Pony"" is an instant favorite.) The game even bends the canon, reaching out to the Love soundtrack's mix of ""Within You Without You"" with ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", which gives you the melody of the first with the drums of the second. Many songs also cut off before their fade-outs-- which was the right call, but it sounds strange on a song as burned in your brain as ""Yellow Submarine"". The first chapters take place in concert settings in front of screaming crowds. But after the Beatles quit the road in 1966, the game segues to the Abbey Road studio, where each song gets a ""dreamscape."" These vignettes recycle well-worn references for each song, and none of them would make the creators of Yellow Submarine lose sleep. Covering the band's psychedelic period, they're a thin metaphor for the fact that the band was well off their tits, but they also reinforce what an insular and magical place these recordings seem to emerge from-- especially if you skip the turmoil behind the scenes. That's not to say the game ignores their history. Good scores unlock rare photos dug from the archives, as well as clips of sound and video.Â You get their 1963 Christmas fan club record, a rough rehearsal for ""Ed Sullivan"", and a promotional film for ""Get Back"" edited out of outtakes from the Let It Be film. And there are clips of the band just chatting or goofing around.. They're candid, but the candidness doesn't make the band seem more human; rather, you feel like you're eavesdropping on a whole new level of divinity. The storytelling is at its finest in the last act, the rooftop show in London in 1969. The audience has aged and the band is tired. We never watch them fight, but the break-up is implied in the climax of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", where the camera jitters until the song cuts off. But encore ""The End"", the unannounced 45th song, is the proper send-off: Ultimately, the band was judged by the love they made. The word ""love"" sums up the entire vision for the game. Where past Rock Band and Guitar Hero titles emphasized the thrills and the grinds of rock, The Beatles: Rock Band feels completely different: it's soothing and cozy, and the songs keep luring you back not just because they're excellent and fun, but because the familiar recordings, the nostalgic visuals, and the Beatles' smiling faces make a peaceful, loving place. As a painstakingly crafted piece of fandom, it's a bullseye. But all this worship has a drawback. Discussing Rock Band 2, which doesn't use the likeness of any real stars, Harmonix's Helen McWilliams once told me, ""We want it to be about you, and your rock star fantasy... You're there with your band, for each other, and you're fulfilling your rock star dream together, and the audience is there for you."" The Beatles: Rock Band is the total opposite. The ""characters"" are untouchable, and the tracks don't even toss you a freestyle section. Your only choices are to get the song right, or not. Sure, it's a clichÃ© that most videogames make you save the world, but at least in those games, you know you're needed. I've never felt less important in a game than this one. But I'll let 'em get away with it. After all, they're the Beatles.

Magical Mystery Tour,The Beatles,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f513d197565213909c/1:1/w_160/1c345345.jpg,2009-09-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13436-magical-mystery-tour/,EMIEMI,"After the death of manager Brian Epstein, the Beatles took a series of rather poor turns, the first of which was the Magical Mystery Tour film. Conceived as a low-key art project, the Beatles were oddly nonchalant about the challenges of putting together a movie. They'd assembled records, they'd worked on A Hard Day's Night and Help!-- how hard could it be? Without Epstein to advise, however, things like budgeting and time management became a challenge, and this understated experimental film turned into a sapping distraction. Musically, however, the accompanying EP was an overwhelming success. The EP format apparently freed the band to experiment a bit, not having to fill sides of a 45 with pop songs or make the grand statements of an album. The title track is a rousing set piece, meant to introduce the travelogue concept of the film. The remaining four songs released exclusive to the EP are low-key marvels-- Paul McCartney's graceful ""The Fool on the Hill"" and music-hall throwback ""Your Mother Should Know"", George Harrison's droning ""Blue Jay Way"", and the percolating instrumental ""Flying"". Few of them are anyone's all-time favorite Beatles songs, only one had a prayer of being played on the radio, and yet this run seems to achieve a majesty in part because of that: It's a rare stretch of amazing Beatles music that can seem like a private obsession rather than a permanent part of our shared culture. As a more laid-back release, the EP suggested the direction the band might have taken on the White Album had it remained a full band, happy to shed the outsized conceptualism and big statements and craft atmospheric, evocative pieces. In the U.S., the EP was paired with three recent double-sided singles, ballooning Magical Mystery Tour into an album-- the only instance in which a U.S. release, often mangled by Capitol, became Beatles canon. With only the EP's title track married specifically to the film's themes, the overall effect of a title track/album sleeve as shell game was in line with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Of the three singles, the undisputed highlight is ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/ ""Penny Lane"", John Lennon and Paul McCartney's tributes to their hometown, Liverpool. Slyly surreal, assisted by studio experimentation but not in debt to it, full of brass, harmonium, and strings, unmistakably English-- when critics call eccentric or baroque UK pop bands ""Beatlesesque,"" this is the closest there is to a root for that adjective. There is no definitive Beatles sound, of course, but with a band that now functions as much as a common, multi-generational language as a group of musicians, it's no surprise that songs rooted in childhood-- the one experience most likely to seem shared and have common touchpoints-- are among their most universally beloved. The rest of the singles collected here are no less familiar: Lennon's ""All You Need Is Love"" was initially completed up for an international TV special on BBC1-- its basic message was meant to translate to any language. Harrison's guitar solo, producer George Martin's strings, and the parade of intertextual musical references that start and close the piece elevate it above hippie hymn. Its flipside, ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", is less successful, a second-rate take on John Lennon's money-isn't-everything theme from the considerably stronger ""And Your Bird Can Sing"". It's the one lesser moment on an otherwise massively rewarding compilation. Much better from Lennon is ""I Am the Walrus"", crafted for the Magical Mystery Tour film and EP but also released as a double-sided single with McCartney's ""Hello Goodbye"". One of Lennon's signature songs, ""Walrus"" channels the singer's longtime fascinations with Lewis Carroll, puns and turns of phrase, and non sequiturs. ""Hello Goodbye"" echoes the same contradictory logic found in the verses of ""All You Need Is Love"", a vague sense of disorientation that still does little to balance its relentlessly upbeat tone. McCartney excelled at selling simplistic lyrics that risk seeming cloying, though, and he again does here-- plus, the kaleidoscopic, carnival-ride melody and interplay between lead and backing vocals ensure it's a much better record than it is a song. In almost every instance on those singles, the Beatles are either whimsical or borderline simplistic, releasing songs that don't seem sophisticated or heavy or monumental (even though most of them are). In that sense, they're all likeÂ ""All You Need Is Love"" or childhood memories or Lewis Carroll-- easy to love, fit for all ages, rich in multi-textual details, deceptively trippy (see Paul's ""Penny Lane"" in particular, with images of it raining despite blue skies, or the songs here that revel in contradictions-- ""Hello Goodbye""'s title, the verses in ""All You Need Is Love""). More than any other place in the band's catalogue, this is where the group seems to crack open a unique world, and for many young kids then and since this was their introduction to music as imagination, or adventure. The rest of the Magical Mystery Tour LP is the opposite of the middle four tracks on the EP-- songs so universal that, like ""Yellow Submarine"", they are practically implanted in your brain from birth. Seemingly innocent, completely soaked through with humor and fantasy, Magical Mystery Tour slots in my mind almost closer to the original Willy Wonka or The Wizard of Oz as it does other Beatles records or even other music-- timeless entertainment crafted with a childlike curiosity and appeal but filled with wit and wonder. On the whole, Magical Mystery Tour is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles' career. True, it doesn't represent some sort of forward momentum or clear new idea-- largely in part because it wasn't conceived as an album. The accompanying pieces on the EP are anomalies in the Beatles oeuvre but they aren't statements per se, or indications that the group is in any sort of transition. But if there was ever a moment in the Beatles' lifetime that listeners would have been happy to have the group just settle in and release songs as soon as possible, it was just before and after the then-interminable 10-month gap between the Revolver and *Sgt. Pepper'*s. Without that context, the results could seem slight-- a sort-of canonized version of Past Masters perhaps-- but whether it's an album, a collection of separate pieces, or whatnot matters little when the music itself is so incredible.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,The Beatles,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f413d1975652139096/1:1/w_160/ca6cb7db.jpg,2009-09-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13435-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band/,EMIEMI,"Finally free of touring, the Beatles next sought to be free of themselves, hitting on the rather daft concept of recording as an alias band. The idea held for all of two songs, one coda, and one album sleeve, but was retained as the central organizing and marketing feature of the band's 1967 album *Sgt. Pepper'*s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Hailed on its release as proof that popular music could be as rich an artistic pursuit as more high-minded media such as jazz and classical, the record's reputation and sense of ambition ushered in the album era. Its influence was so pervasive and so instructional regarding the way music is crafted and sold to the public that this is still the predominant means of organizing, distributing, and promoting new music four decades later, well after the decline of physical media. The concept, of course, is that the record was to be recorded by the titular fictional band, a washed-up rock'n'roll group on the comeback trail. (This was actually the second concept earmarked for the Beatles' next LP; the original, a record of songs about Liverpool, was abandoned when its first two tracks were needed for the group's next single, ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/ ""Penny Lane"".) Probably for the best, little of the fictional-band vision for the record made it through; what did last from that conceit are a few tangential ideas-- a satirical bent on popular entertainment and a curiosity with nostalgia and the past. The record opens with a phony live performance by the Lonely Hearts Band, a sort of Vegas act-- the sort of thing that, in 1963, people thought the almost certainly soon-to-be-passÃ© Beatles would be doing themselves in 1967. Instead, the Beatles had completed their shattering of the rules of light entertainment, even halting their own live performances, which they'd never again do together for a paid audience. Even as they mocked this old version of a performing band, ironically *Sgt. Pepper'*s and its ambitions helped to codify the rock band as artists rather than popular entertainers. In the hands of their followers, the notion of a pop group as a compact, independent entity, responsible for writing, arranging, and performing its own material would be manifested in the opposite way-- rather than holing up in the studio and focusing on records, bands were meant to prove in the flesh they could ""bring it"" live. Notions of authenticity and transparency would become valued over studio output. (To be fair, upstart bands had to gig in order to get attention and a reputation, while the Beatles, of course, could write, break, and rewrite their own rules; they had the luxury and freedom to take advantage of a changing entertainment world and could experiment with different, emerging models of how to function as a rock band in much the same way that Trent Reznor or Radiohead can today.) The freedom from live performance didn't necessitate that Beatles songs now sounded practiced or rehearsed, and indeed they weren't. Instead, they were studio creations assembled in sections and pieces. As the band splintered, this practice would spill over into releasing song sketches on the White Album and inspire, in part through necessity, the lengthy song cycle at the close of Abbey Road. On Sgt. Pepper's, the most rewarding manifestation of this shift was the record's most forward-looking piece, ""A Day in the Life"". Complex in construction and epic in feel, ""A Day in the Life"" nevertheless seems enveloping and breezy to listeners. Indeed, the sustained, closing ringing chord of the song comes a mere 4:20 into the track. ""A Day""'s only best-in-show competitor was McCartney's ""She's Leaving Home"". (As on Revolver, the peaks here were a mold-breaking closer and classically inspired story-song). ""A Day in the Life"" has only grown in estimation, rightfully becoming one of the most acclaimed Beatles tracks. ""She's Leaving Home"", by contrast, has slid from view-- perhaps too maudlin to work on classic rock radio and too MOR for hipster embrace, it was nevertheless the other headline track on Sgt. Pepper's when it was released. The story of a runaway teen, it misses as a defiant generational statement in part because it's actually sympathetic to the parents in the song. In the second verse, McCartney defies expectations by not following the young girl on her adventure but keeping the track set in the home as her parents wake to find her goodbye letter. In the end, we learn ""She"" left home for ""fun""-- a rather churlish reason, and when paired with McCartney's simplistic sentiments in ""When I'm 64"" (the aging couple there will be happy to ""scrimp and save""), the young girl seems more selfish than trapped. In fact, for a group whose every move was a generational wedge, and for such a modern record, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper'*s is oddly conservative in places: ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" takes inspiration from a Victorian-era carnival; ""When I'm 64"" is a music-hall parody that fantasizes about what it would be like to be the Beatles' grandparents' age; ""Fixing a Hole"" has a rather mundane domestic setting; the fantasy girl in ""Lovely Rita"" is a cop. Lyrically, it's an atypical way to usher in the Summer of Love, but musically, the record is wildly inventive, built on double-tracking, tape effects, and studio technology. The dream-like haze of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", the fairground, sawdust feel of ""Mr. Kite"", and the cavalcade of sound effects at the end of ""Good Morning Good Morning"" were the most demonstrative sounds on the record, but otherwise benign passages were also steeped in innovation, whether recording from the inside of a brass instrument or plugging instruments directly into the sound board instead of capturing them through mics. Almost everything done on Sgt. Pepper's turned out to be new and forward-thinking, from the iconic record sleeve to the totemic ending to ""A Day in the Life"". There are very few moments in pop music history in which you can mark a clear before and after, in which almost everything changed. In the UK, it's arguably happened only five times, and on just four instances in the U.S. (Thriller here; acid house and punk there, and Elvis everywhere, of course); in both nations, the Beatles launched two of those moments. In retrospect, it almost seems like this time the band itself was taken aback by its own accomplishments, not only shying from directly living up to Revolver via the smoke and mirrors of the Lonely Hearts Club Band but then never again throwing themselves into their work as a collective unit. *Sgt. Pepper'*s, possibly as a corrective to the hushed tones with which it's been received for decades, has slipped in estimation behind a few of the band's other records, but it's easy to hear how it achieved that reputation in the first place. Even if John, Paul, George, and Ringo would arguably go on to best a handful of its moments, the amazing stretch of music created in 1966-67 was the peak of the Beatles as a working band.

Revolver,The Beatles,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f25e6ef95969320c05/1:1/w_160/82430f97.jpg,2009-09-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13434-revolver/,EMIEMI,"Like any band, the Beatles' recording career was often altered, even pushed forward, as much by external factors as their own creative impulses. The group's competitive drive had them, at times, working to match or best Bob Dylan or Brian Wilson; their drug use greatly colored the musical outlook of John Lennon and George Harrison in particular; and the death of former manager Brian Epstein ushered in a period of distracting and poor business choices and opened the door for individuals such as the celebrity guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Yoko Ono, and businessman Allen Klein to penetrate, alter, and, some would say, disintegrate their inner circle. The most important of these external shifts in the Beatles narrative, however, was a series of changes that allowed them to morph into a studio band. The chain of events that ushered in the band's changing approach to studio music began before Rubber Soul, but the results didn't come into full fruition until Revolver, a 35-minute LP that took 300 hours of studio time to create-- roughly three times the amount allotted to Rubber Soul, and an astronomical amount for a record in 1966. Longtime Beatles producer George Martin, justifiably upset that EMI refused to give him a raise on the back of his extraordinarily profitable work with the Beatles, quit his post with the label in August 1965. Martin used his clout to create his own company, and the group and producer used theirs to effectively camp out at Abbey Road Studios for whatever length of time suited them rather than being forced to comply to the rigid and economically sound schedules demanded by labels at the time. The Beatles could now work both in and out of the studio, taking full advantage of new advancements in sound recording that allowed them to reflect upon and tinker with their work, explore new instruments and studio trickery, and refine their music by solving problems when they arose. This new approach not only greatly altered their work environment, but drove the Beatles to value the flexibility of emerging technology. They also cashed in some of their commercial capital to abandon the mentally and physically sapping practice of touring-- and the glad-handing and public relations requirements that went with it. Exceptionalism became the watchword for the band, and it responded by using its freedom to push forward its art and, by extension, the whole of pop music. Musically, then, the Beatles began to craft dense, experimental works; lyrically, they matched that ambition, maturing pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived. Revolver was also the first record in which the impression of the Beatles as a holistic gang was disrupted. The group had taken three months off prior to Revolver-- easily its longest break since the start of its recording career-- and each band member went his own separate way after years of moving around the world as a unit. Even without the break, it's possible that the group would continue to explore individual concerns: After starting to do just that onÂ Rubber Soul, it was only natural that the Beatles wished to continue to highlight their individual strengths on its follow-up, and they did by listing each song's lead singer on the record sleeve. The first, surprisingly, was George Harrison, who kicks off the record with another stab at politics on ""Taxman"", and then later offers philosophical musings on ""I Want to Tell You"" and the Indian-flavored ""Love You To"". Over the next year or two, Harrison's guitar played a more background role in the group's recordings-- fortuitously, then, that time also corresponded with the years in which the Beatles were pleased to bunker down in the studio and most explore the dynamic tension between their individual interests and their final stretch of camaraderie and mutual respect. Lennon's primary interest throughout much of this time was himself, something that continued throughout his career-- he was always suspicious, even dismissive, of Paul McCartney's character songs, but once he and Yoko Ono joined forces, her Fluxus-rooted belief in art-as-subjectivity became orthodoxy in his mind. Lennon's early explorations of self and mind that began on Rubber Soul continued on Revolver, as the suburbanite spent much of his time at home indulging his zest for the exploratory powers of LSD. He contributes five songs to Revolver, and, indeed, each is concerned with drugs, the creative mind, a suspicion of the outside world, or all three. Each is also uniformly wonderful, and together they provide a tapestry of Lennon's burgeoning art-pop, which, along with Martin's inventive arrangements and playful effects, would peak the next year with the triumphs of ""I Am the Walrus"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", and ""A Day in the Life"". The gauzy ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and rollicking 1-2 of ""She Said She Said"" and ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" aren't nearly as demonstrative as the songs he'd write in their wake-- as a result each remains oddly underrated-- but they function as some of Lennon's most purely satisfying pop songs. ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is another thing entirely. While ""Doctor Robert"" or ""She Said She Said"" touched on drug culture playfully or privately, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" was a full-on attempt to recreate the immersive experience of LSD-- complete with lyrics borrowed from Timothy Leary's *Tibetan Book of the Dead-*inspired writings. Remarkably, though, much of it due to Martin's experimental production, tape loops, and musique concrÃ¨te-inspired backdrop, the song is lively and giddy instead of self-serious or preachy. Even Martin's primitive psychedelia could have been thudding and ponderous, and yet more than four decades later the entire thing seems less a clear product of its time than not only most art or experimental rock, but most Beatles records as well. Despite that triumph, however, Revolver was McCartney's maturation record as much as Rubber Soul was for Lennon. While Harrison was learning at the feet of sitar master Ravi Shankar and Lennon was navigating heavy use of psychotropic drugs, McCartney was refining his compositional chops by exploring classical music, training an eye for detail and subtlety in his lyrics, and embracing the orchestral work of Brian Wilson. McCartney's optimism and populism resulted in the most demonstrative songs he created for Revolver-- the brassy ""Good Day Sunshine"" (which delightfully toes the line between schmaltz and heartwarming) and ""Got to Get You Into My Life"", and the children's music staple ""Yellow Submarine"", an inventive and charming track too often derided as camp. (It's also an early indication that it would be McCartney who would hold tightest to the impression of the group as a unit-- the image of the band all living together here was, for the first time in years, untrue.) The understated qualities of McCartney's lyrics began to be misconstrued as simplistic in his ballads, but he provides three of his best here: ""For No One"", all the more affecting because it's slight and difficult to grasp, ""Here, There and Everywhere"", a model of sepia-toned sentimentality, and ""Eleanor Rigby"", which in its own way was as groundbreaking and revolutionary as ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". Virtually a short story set to music, ""Rigby"" and its interwoven descriptions of lonely people was and is a desolate and altogether mature setting for a pop song. Revolver in the end is the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence. The Beatles had been transformed into a group not beholden to the expectations of their label or bosses, but fully calling the shots-- recording at their own pace, releasing records at a less-demanding clip, abandoning the showmanship of live performance. Lesser talents or a less-motivated group of people may have shrunk from the challenge, but here the Beatles took upon the task of redefining what was expected from popular music. Lest we forget it, the original flashpoint of Beatlemania remains the most influential and revolutionary period in the Beatles career, but the creative high points of 1966-67 aren't far behind. It's worth remembering as well that what had been demanded or expected from them as entertainers and popular musicians was something they'd challenged from their first cheeky, flippant interview, but just a few years later they were no longer mere anomalies within the world of pop, no longer potential fads; they were avatars for a transformative cultural movement.

Rubber Soul,The Beatles,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f0ea9e61561daa525d/1:1/w_160/f43e31e0.jpg,2009-09-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13433-rubber-soul/,EMIEMI,"To modern ears, Rubber Soul and its pre-psychedelic era mix of 1960s pop, soul, and folk could seem tame, even quaint on a cursory listen. But it's arguably the most important artistic leap in the Beatles' career-- the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter. It's also the record that started them on their path toward the valuation of creating studio records over live performance. If nothing else, it's the record on which their desire for artistic rather than commercial ambition took center stage-- a radical idea at a time when the success of popular music was measured in sales and quantity rather than quality. Indeed, at the time the Beatles did need a new direction: Odd as it seems today, the lifespan of a pop band's career in the early 60s could often be measured in months, sometimes in years, rarely in three-year increments. And by 1965, the Beatles were in danger of seeming lightweight compared to their new peers: The Who's sloganeering, confrontational singles were far more ferocious; the Rolling Stones' ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" was a much more raucous, anti-ennui cry than the Beatles' ""Help!""; and the Kinks beat the Beatles to both satirical, character songs and the influence of Indian music. By comparison, most of the Beatles music to date was either rock'n'roll covers or originals offering a (mostly) wholesome, positive take on boy-girl relationships. Above all, Bob Dylan's lyrical acumen and the Byrds' confident, jangly guitar were primary influences on John Lennon and George Harrison, respectively (and the Byrds had been influenced by the Beatles, too-- Roger McGuinn first picked up a Rickenbacker 12-string after seeing A Hard Day's Night). Dylan and the Byrds' fingerprints had been left on Help!-- Lennon, the group's biggest Dylan acolyte, played an acoustic rather than electric guitar throughout most of that record. Even Paul McCartney's ""Yesterday"" found him strumming an acoustic. (All this at a time when Dylan was beginning to move in the other direction and fully enter his electric period.) Harrison was growing more serious on the political ""Think for Yourself"", while ""If I Needed Someone""-- his other contribution to Rubber Soul-- is practically a Byrds pastiche and his chiming, sure-footed solo on ""Nowhere Man"" also displays a debt to that band. His deft touch is all over the record in subtle ways-- appropriate for an album full of finesse and small wonders (the ping at the end of the ""Nowhere Man"" solo, Lennon's exhalation in the chorus of ""Girl"", the ""tit-tit-tit"" of the backing vocalists in the same song, the burbling guitar in ""Michelle""). The most lasting influences of Dylan and the Byrds on the Beatles, however, were likely their roles in introducing the group to recreational drugs: Dylan shepherded the quartet through their first experience with pot, while the Byrds were with three-fourths of the Beatles when they first purposefully took LSD. (McCartney sat that one out, avoiding the drug for another year, while Harrison and Lennon had each had a previous accidental dosage.) Marijuana's effect on the group is most heavily audible on Rubber Soul. (By the time of their next album, Revolver, three-fourths of the group had been turned on to LSD, and their music was headed somewhere else entirely.) With its patient pace and languid tones, Rubber Soul is an altogether much more mellow record than anything the Beatles had done before, or would do again. It's a fitting product from a quartet just beginning to explore their inner selves on record. Lennon, in particular, continued his more introspective and often critical songwriting, penning songs of romance gone wrong or personal doubt and taking a major step forward as a lyricist. Besting his self-critical ""I'm a Loser"" with ""Nowhere Man"" was an accomplishment, and the faraway, dreamy ""Girl"" was arguably his most musically mature song to date. Lennon's strides were most evident, however, on ""Norwegian Wood"", an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar, and the mature, almost fatalistic heart-tug of ""In My Life"", which displayed a remarkably calm and peaceful attitude toward not only one's past and present, but their future and the inevitability of death. Considering Harrison's contributions and Lennon's sharp growth, McCartney-- fresh from the success of ""Yesterday""-- oddly comes off third-string on Rubber Soul. His most lasting contributions-- the Gallic ""Michelle"" (which began life as a piss-take, and went on to inspire the Teutonic swing and sway of Lennon's ""Girl""), the gentle rocker ""I'm Looking Through You"", and the grinning ""Drive My Car"" are relatively minor compared to Lennon's masterstrokes. McCartney did join his bandmate in embracing relationship songs about miscommunication, not seeing eye-to-eye, and heartbreak, but it wouldn't be until 1966 that he took his next great artistic leap, doing so as both a storyteller and, even more so, a composer.

Help!,The Beatles,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5eac0084474cd0c082a/1:1/w_160/395ad8fb.jpg,2009-09-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13428-help/,EMIEMI,"In A Hard Days Night, after throwing a sarky George Harrison out of their studio, a fashion-maven TV producer and his assistant try and make sense of him. Such a rude young man-- but is he ""an early clue to the new direction""? They consult the calendar: no, the new trend isn't due for another three weeks. It's a gag, and not an original one, but born of truth: the fashion watcher's assumption was that things ran on a two to three year cycle. As 1965 began, the Beatles obviously weren't going away, but being pop's aristocracy didn't necessarily make you pop's leading edge. The kids were coming up from behind. Commentators like Nik Cohn had noted sections of the pop audience looking to R&B clubs for their harder-edged, bluesier sound, and this was bleeding into the mainstream. The Animals could claim a no. 1, the Stones had two. So did London's Kinks, and if the Who didn't it was only because their routines were too extreme. And so, two years and four albums into their career, the Beatles at last had rivals. Serious ones, who'd rampaged through the door the Beatles opened and blithely ignored the showbiz conventions the Beatles were contractually tied to. While the Rolling Stones recorded ""Satisfaction"", the Beatles were being trotted around the world shooting the ambitious, ridiculous Help!. Its soundtrack album is as haphazard as Beatles For Sale, but lacks that record's glowering intensity. Luckily, it replaces moodiness with curiosity and a much-expanded instrumental palette. They'd been intermittent experimenters from the start, but Help! is where the band's interest in sound and arrangement really starts to flower, and this remastered version is a particular feast of new timbres and ideas: the percussion on ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"", Indian instrumentation appearing on ""Ticket to Ride"", the weary woodwind on ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"". All this is put into the service of some of the band's best pop songs. The title track, for instance, where Lennon's as confused and angry as he was on ""I'm a Loser"", but now the music doesn't follow suit-- its briskness blanks his pleas, and his bandmates sound more mocking than sympathetic. Paul gets similar finger-wagging backing on ""The Night Before"", a wonderfully jaunty song about being dumped after a one-night stand. ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"" is another song happy to marry beauty to venom-- its words an explicit threat, its harmonies an example of the seemingly effortless loveliness that makes people go gooey and mystical when the Beatles are mentioned. Obviously, their new interest in texture wasn't wholly distinct from their new interest in drugs. The ""reference"" in ""It's Only Love"" is played for laughs, but ""Tell Me What You See"" falls halfway between romance and mysticism and is rather awkward despite its marvelous period percussion. The album has other murky spots-- Harrison's songs are fine, but ""Act Naturally"" suggests that finding a tune for Ringo every album was becoming an issue. And the closing version of ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"" is a farewell to the ""end it with a rocker"" formula that drags despite Lennon's best efforts to rouse it. It doesn't help ""Dizzy"" that it's placed just after two personal breakthroughs for McCartney. ""I've Just Seen a Face"" and ""Yesterday"" are both love songs, rich with feeling but never overwrought, with the deceptive lightness that would become trademark and millstone for their writer. ""Face"", a folksy country song, demonstrated the gift for pastiche that would help give the rest of the Beatles' career such convincing variety. ""Yesterday"" went further, demonstrating that you could arrange a pop song orchestrally in a way that might deepen it, not just turn it into kitsch. Of all their tracks, ""Yesterday"" is surely the one that's hardest to listen to with new ears. This remaster, capturing its preternatural serenity, is a terrific opportunity to do exactly that. Help! is almost the last twitch of the Beatles as a working, gigging beat group. It's a great but confusing record, and no wonder contemporaries felt they might at last be losing direction. With hindsight confusion looks like transition, and the remasters-- issued all at once and linked to a game designed to present the band's story as a story-- can't help but invite that hindsight. But the story could have turned out differently, and these early records are still so fierce and alive. Taking the Beatles one disc at a time lets us recover their precariousness, the risks they took, what they lost as well as what they gained.

Beatles For Sale,The Beatles,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e5c0084474cd0c081d/1:1/w_160/30861e98.jpg,2009-09-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13424-beatles-for-sale/,EMIEMI,"The Beatles faced the same pressures every teen sensation has since-- fatigue, frustration, being bounced into recording substandard material. ""It isn't a pot-boiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-Christmas mixture,"" claimed Derek Taylor on the Beatles For Sale sleeve. This pre-emptive strike looks more than a little defensive, especially when the cover versions are back in force, and one of them is the notorious and oft-detested ""Mr. Moonlight"". The workrate expected of early-1960s pop stars is one of the hardest things for modern listeners to get their heads around. We're used to bands making a record, touring in support, searching for inspiration, trying out new ideas, maybe two years later making another. Because our experience of the early Beatles is structured around their albums, we tend to think of them as doing something similar, except at a much more rapid pace. As Ian Macdonald's superb Revolution in the Head makes clear, this wasn't true: albums, singles, EPs, tours tumbled over one another with hardly a break-- a firehose of almost continuous activity. There were two reasons for this workload. Firstly the music industry simply hadn't worked out yet how to extend a record's shelf life-- singles weren't taken from albums after all. Secondly the lifespan of acts wasn't expected to be long, so it made sense to get the most work possible out of them. The famous hotch-potch of their early American catalogue was one result. The Beatles themselves were changing how the business worked, but Beatles For Sale, of all the British records, bears the stamp of these business realities. It's a mess. But it's a really good mess. Taylor's sleevenotes are also interesting because they go out of the way to reassure listeners that everything they're hearing can be reproduced live. Studio experimentation was becoming more important to the band and producer George Martin, but clearly someone viewed it with a little nervousness. You can understand why: The Lennon-McCartney originals on Beatles For Sale are often full of curious arrangements, drones, jagged transitions, and lashings of aggression. Blame pot, or the inspiration of Bob Dylan, or just the pressure-cooker environment the group was in, but the record hits a seam of angry creativity. This is particularly true of Lennon's amazing first three songs. ""No Reply"" shatters itself with waves of jealous rage, taking the menace that had flecked Beatles music and bringing it up in the mix: his dangerously quiet ""that's a lie"" is the most chilling moment in their catalogue. ""I'm a Loser"" turns that anger inward with just as much brutality. And ""Baby's in Black"" curdles a nursery rhyme, transforms the group's crisp pop sound into an off-kilter clang, and uses John and Paul McCartney's double vocal to thicken the soupy sound even further. This run of tracks marries the direct attack of their earliest material and the boundary-pushing of their later albums, and stands with the best of both. Even so it's a relief when ""Rock and Roll Music"" breaks the tension, especially when you notice that the band are playing their best rock'n'roll since ""Twist and Shout"". Perhaps the workrate had pushed them back into the Hamburg hot zone, but the uptempo covers on Beatles For Sale are fiercely good-- as ragged, loud and immediate as the songs needed to be. Even ""Mr. Moonlight"" fits the aggressive mood, the ugliness of its organ solo surely deliberate. McCartney's songs on Beatles For Sale are more thoughtful than moody, though on his splendid ""Every Little Thing""-- given melodramatic thrust by Shangri-Las-style piano and bass drum-- he's distinctly melancholy, his ""yes, I know I'm a lucky guy"" sounding like an attempt to convince himself of that. But Lennon's anger and the band's rediscovery of rock'n'roll mean For Sale's reputation as the group's meanest album is deserved, even if it has ""Eight Days a Week"" as its breezy centerpiece. The lumpiest and least welcoming of their early records, it's also one of the most rewarding.

A Hard Day's Night,The Beatles,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e2c0084474cd0c0813/1:1/w_160/df2c2a43.jpg,2009-09-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13422-a-hard-days-night/,EMIEMI,"Pop in 1964 was part of showbiz: Once the Beatles hit a certain level of box office, there would never have been any question over making a film. Pop music meant teenagers, which meant fads, which meant the clock was running on the band's fame. The jazzman George Melly, who was writing about pop in the UK press at this time, remembered being convinced several times that the Beatles had hit a peak and their fans would soon desert them. I doubt this was an unorthodox opinion. A film career might extend the fame a little, and smooth the band's inevitable transition to light entertainment. If the film was an enjoyable romp, so much the better-- John Lennon asked for A Hard Day's Night director Richard Lester on the basis of a comedy short he'd made (later referenced in the film's famous ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence), but Lester had also helmed 1962's It's Trad, Dad!, a snapshot of the British pop world just pre-Beatles (Tagline: ""The newest, most frantic fad!""). He knew how to mix music and feelgood filmmaking to commercial effect. A Hard Day's Night, in other words, is a crucial inflection point in the Beatles' career. Coinciding with their leaving Liverpool and moving to London, this could easily have been their first step on a road of crowd-pleasing predictability: Instead, both film and this soundtrack album are a testament to how fabulous pop can be when you take care over doing it. The album is most famous now for being the first all-original record the band put out-- and their only all Lennon-McCartney LP. Formidably prolific at this point, the pair had been creating songs-- and hits-- for other performers which must have given them useful insight into how to make different styles work. There's been a particular jump forward in ballad writing-- on ""And I Love Her"" in particular, Paul McCartney hits a note of humble, open-hearted sincerity he'd return to again and again. His ""Things We Said Today"" is even better, wintry and philosophical before the surprising, stirring middle eight. But the dominant sound of the album is the Beatles in full cry as a pop band-- with no rock'n'roll covers to remind you of their roots you're free to take the group's new sound purely on its own modernist terms: The chord choices whose audacity surprised a listening Bob Dylan, the steamroller power of the harmonies, the gleaming sound of George Harrison's new Rickenbacker alongside the confident Northern blasts of harmonica, and a band and producer grown more than comfortable with each other. There's detail aplenty here-- and the remasters make it easy to hunt for-- but A Hard Day's Night is perhaps the band's most straightforward album: You notice the catchiness first, and you can wonder how they got it later. The best example of this is the title track-- the clang of that opening chord to put everyone on notice, two burning minutes thick with percussion (including a hammering cowbell!) thanks to the new four-track machines George Martin was using, and then the song spiraling out with a guitar figure as abstractedly lovely as anything the group had recorded. John Lennon's best songs on the record-- ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Tell Me Why"", ""When I Get Home"", ""You Can't Do That""-- are fast, aggressive, frustrated and spiked with these moments of breathtaking prettiness. The Hard Day's Night film itself was also a triumph in its way-- Lester's camerawork capturing the frenzy of Beatlemania and the way the group's music was feeding off it. It had the happy effect of introducing the group's millions of new global fans to their world-- the fire escapes, boutiques, bombed-out spaces, and well-preserved salons of 60s London. In fact the film's knowing dialogue and pop-art cinematography has a level of surface sophistication that the Beatles' records don't approach for another year or two (though they were already far more emotionally nourishing). Watching the film you're reminded that what the Beatles had set in motion was pop music's catching up with the rest of British popular culture: In art, in TV satire, in film and fashion and literature, the 60s were already a boom time. Pop had been left behind-- tastemakers looked instead to jazz and folk to soundtrack this creativity. What the Beatles had-- accidentally-- unlocked was pop music's potential to join, then lead, the party-- though it wasn't yet a given that they'd be the band to realize said potential. A Hard Day's Night is an album of an era when pop and showbiz were inseparable-- and if it doesn't transcend that time, it does represent its definitive peak.

With the Beatles,The Beatles,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e1c0084474cd0c0810/1:1/w_160/369bfdea.jpg,2009-09-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13421-with-the-beatles/,EMIEMI,"Would that today's PRs had the honesty of Beatles pressman Tony Barrow. On the original sleevenotes for With the Beatles he cheerfully admits that the group were following the formula of Please Please Me, going so far as to make several track-by-track comparisons. ""[PaulÂ McCartney] recalls the numerous Cavern Club occasions when this item ['Money'] brought forth the same type of overwhelming response given to 'Twist and Shout'."" Barrow's notes are direct and descriptive-- crediting each R&B find, noting which tracks were live favorites and who played what. They're an intriguing glimpse of how the band related to its audience in this first shock of pop success: as curious, educated listeners, not the blind screamers of Beatlemania legend. By this point, though, the Beatles were kings of Britain with the world about to follow. Their success was already game-changing: The band who would go on to invent the concept album invented the boy band first. The cheek, the gang mentality, the picking favorites-- all this would be formularized by later svengalis but emerged initially out of Beatle fandom. So With the Beatles is simultaneously a quickly turned-around cash-in and a record of real generosity and integrity. And if the structure of the album is pretty similar to Please Please Me, the extra studio time is already starting to tell. On McCartney's romantic spotlight, showtune ""Till There Was You"", producer George Martin builds a wholly convincing soft-focus soundworld around Ringo Starr's bongos. The group harmonies on tracks like their rumbustious ""Please Mr. Postman"" are even more gorgeously thick. The way the drums rumble in on ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is a moment of simple joy. And those are just the covers. With the Beatles starts with aggressive confidence, ""It Won't Be Long"" taking the ""yeah yeah"" chants that were the group's early calling card and turning them into missiles. We're back, it says, and it's one of their most thrilling songs. On ""All My Loving"" the guitars bubble and tumble and the band finds a new way to marry prettiness and drive. ""I Wanna Be Your Man""-- Ringo's best early vocal-- has a wolfish, hustling urgency. Not everything the band tries, as writers or interpreters, comes off: draggy girl group revival ""Devil in Her Heart"" is an obscurity too far, and George Harrison wins a first songwriting credit for the Shadows-esque ""Don't Bother Me"", but it doesn't get much spark until the guitar solo. As for ""Money"", well, there simply is no second ""Twist and Shout"" in the catalogue, but neither was there any shame in the Beatles trying. And it has its own thrills to offer: Less demonic and frenetic than that previous album-closer but by some way the heaviest thing they'd yet recorded, a quality the remaster brings fully out. Ringo's booming drums, John Lennon's sneer, and the others' banshee backing vocals all create an air of menace, repressed violence: the black leather and Bierkeller vibe of the band's 1961 proving grounds. It's a superb way to end an album that doesn't quite flow as well as Please Please Me, but never cheats the fans either. A week after its release the band would drop ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and rewrite the entertainment pecking order: For now they were living up to high expectations.

Please Please Me,The Beatles,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d75e6ef95969320bcd/1:1/w_160/d73445c5.jpg,2009-09-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13419-please-please-me/,EMIEMI,"Whether or not you think the Beatles are the best rock band of all time, it's hard to deny they're the best rock story*.* Their narrative arc-- of graft, tragedy, and stardom; of genius emerging and fragmenting-- is irresistible. More so when you factor in the sense that they drove their fascinating times as much as mirrored them. But the satisfying sweep of the Beatles' epic risks doing them a disservice. It makes their achievements and development feel somehow predestined, an inevitable consequence of their astonishing talent. Of course, this isn't the case: Every record they made was born out of a new set of challenges and built around tough decisions. The marketing of the band over the past few decades by their record label, Apple, has been aimed at creating a sense of apart-ness: Let lesser talents digitize their songs, feature on compilations, sell their music to samplers. The Beatles are different. This flatters listeners who were there, but setting the band apart from the rest of the pop world risks sterilizing their music and making newcomers as resentful as curious. Besides, at the start they weren't so different at all. Britain in the early 1960s swarmed with rock'n'roll bands, creating local scenes like the Mersey Sound the Beatles dominated. Rock'n'roll hadn't died out, but it had become unfashionable in showbiz eyes-- a small-club dance music that thrived on local passion. It was raucous, even charming in a quaint way, but there was no money in it for the big-timers of the London music biz. At the same time the record market was booming. The Conservative UK government of the late 1950s had deliberately stoked a consumer boom: Aping the post-war consumption of the U.S., more British households than ever owned TVs, washing machines, and record players. The number of singles sold in Britain increased eightfold between the emergence of Elvis in 1956 and the Beatles in '63. Combine this massively increased potential audience with the local popularity of rock'n'roll and some kind of crossover success seems inevitable-- the idiocy of the Decca label in turning down the Beatles isn't so much a businessman's failure to recognize genius as a businessman's failure toÂ recognizeÂ good business. The Beatles' life as a rock'n'roll band-- their fabled first acts in Hamburg clubs and Liverpool's Cavern-- is mostly lost to us. The party line on Please Please Me is that it's a raw, high-energy run-through of their live set, but to me this seems just a little disingenuous. It's not even that the album, by necessity, can't reflect the group's two-hour shows and the frenzy-baiting lengths they'd push setpiece songs to. It's that the disc was recorded on the back of a #1 single, and there was a big new audience to consider when selecting material. There's rawness here-- rawness they never quite captured again-- but a lot of sweetness too, particularly in Lennon-McCartney originals ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"". Rather than an accurate document of an evening with the pre-fame Beatles, Please Please Me works more like a DJ mix album-- a truncated, idealized teaser for their early live shows. More than any other of their records, Please Please Me is a dance music album. Almost everything on the record, even ballads like ""Anna"", has a swing and a kick born from the hard experience of making a small club move. And it starts and ends with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Twist and Shout"", the most kinetic, danceable tracks they ever made. The ""evening with the band"" feel makes Please Please Me a more coherent experience than other cover-heavy Beatles albums: Here other peoples' songs work not just as filler, but as markers for styles and effects the band admired and might return to as songwriters. McCartney, for instance, would go on to write songs whose drama and emotional nuance would embarrass ""A Taste of Honey"", but for now he puts his all into its cornball melodrama, and the song fits. Please Please Me also works as a unit because the group's vocals are so great. At least some of this is due to the remastering, which makes the Beatles' singing thrillingly up-close and immediate. I'd never really paid much attention to ""Chains"" and the Ringo-led ""Boys"", but the clearer vocals on each-- ""Chains""' sarcastic snarls and the harmonies helping Ringo out-- make them far more compelling. And as you'd imagine, making the voices more vivid means Lennon's kamikaze take on ""Twist and Shout"" sounds even more ferocious. Done in one cut at the session's end, it could have been an unusable wreck. Instead, it's one of the group's most famous triumphs. This sums up the Beatles for me. Rather than a band whose path to the top was ordained by their genius, they were a group with the luck to meet opportunities, the wit to recognize them, the drive to seize them, and the talent to fulfil them. Please Please Me is the sound of them doing all four.

Stereo Box / In Mono,The Beatles,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e7ea9e61561daa5248/1:1/w_160/4a2d9342.jpg,2009-09-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13425-stereo-box-in-mono/,EMI,"In 1987, the Beatles' albums appeared on compact disc for the first time. Considering how much music had already found its way to CD, the Beatles were very late, so the digital rollout was a big deal. The new issues came out in batches and the excitement steadily built, peaking when Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band came out on June 1, 1987, the 20th anniversary of its original release (""It was 20 years ago today..."" was perhaps the greatest record marketing hook of all time.) In the 22 years since, plenty of bands have had their catalogues reissued a few times over (some with ridiculous frequency-- looking at you, Bowie and Costello), either to take advantage of improvements in technology or to repackage the records to sell them again to existing fans. But those 1987 CD versions have been it as far as the original Beatles albums. They've done some special projects-- Let It Be...Naked, two volumes of The Capitol Albums, collecting American versions of their records, the remix album Love-- but if, two months ago, you wanted to buy a copy of A Hard Day's Night, you'd be getting the 1987 remaster, done with 1987 technology, complete with a flimsy, bare-bones CD insert in a jewel case. This week, Capitol/EMI rectifies the situation. The entire Beatles catalogue has been remastered and the CDs are coming out in new editions. It is perhaps ironic that this is happening as interest in the compact disc format is on the wane, but once again Beatles fans are excited. Are they worth buying again? Over the next three days, we're going to be reviewing all of the Beatles reissues, including the Beatles Rock Band game also coming out this week. But in addition to discussing the music and the records, we wanted to take a moment here to lay out some general thoughts on the sets, with further details relegated to the proper reviews. First, the configurations. All 12 original albums, from Please Please Me to Let It Be, have been remastered and are being issued in stereo (these are the same tracklistings as have been on CD since the 80s, including the American version of Magical Mystery Tour). In addition, the two Past Masters CDs, which collect singles and tracks that didn't appear on the original albums, have been combined into one 2xCD set. The first four albums are appearing in stereo on CD for the first time. The packaging for all stereo CDs includes the original artwork and liner notes, along with new recording notes and a historical essay. Rather than jewel boxes, the stereo CDs are packaged in sharp-looking and durable foldout cardboard packaging. Each CD contains a short documentary in QuickTime format on the making of the album (these are said to be limited to this initial reissue). The packaging in general is very well done; the albums feel like they were put together with care and great attention to detail. You hold one in your hand, and it feels important. I've never been a fan of the plastic jewel box, and it's wonderful that they've done away with them here. CDs slide into a little pocket, so there are no spindles to break. The liner notes are succinct and informative, they favor the factual over the hyperbolic, and they cover what should be covered. The documentaries are well done but about what you would expect: four minutes long or so, narrated with interviews with the Beatles and George Martin culled from the Anthology project, with archival photos and film footage. They're certainly nothing revelatory, but a nice intro to the world of the album for anyone unfamiliar with the details. All in all, they did the packages right. In addition to the individual CDs, the reissues are available in two box set configurations. The Stereo Box collects the stereo versions of all the albums and adds a DVD gathering all the short documentaries in one place. In Mono-- limited, but it's not exactly clear yet how limited-- is more of a specialty item. It presents mono mixes of albums (which are available only in the box set, not for sale individually) from P**lease Please Me up through The Beatles (aka the White Album). Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, and Let It Be were never mixed for mono, and are not included, but the set does include a 2xCD set called The Mono Masters with mono mixes of most of the singles included on Past Masters (a few of the later ones were never mixed for mono). Each record included with In Mono appears in a mini-LP replica package, accurate all the way down to the original printing on the inner sleeves (yep, you can slide the CDs in them if you want). Two discs, Help! and Rubber Soul, also contain the original stereo mixes on the same disc as the mono mixes (the 1987 CD issues were newly remixed for stereo). The original inserts included with the LPs-- the individual portraits in The Beatles, the cut-outs in Sgt. Pepper's-- are included as well. There are no CD booklets in In Mono; rather, the set contains a separate booklet of liner notes, covering the Mono Masters set in detail, and explaining the differences between the stereo and mono mixes of the proper albums. There are also no mini-documentaries. Why mono? Two reasons. First, pop music in stereo was still a novelty through most of the 60s. Radio was dominated by single-channel AM, and the young people who bought LPs were far more likely to have a mono record player as a sound source. Given their audience and the technology of the time, for much of the Beatles' run, the band themselves considered the mono mix as the ""real"" version of the record and devoted more of their attention to it. Mono mixes were prepared first with the involvement of the band, and in some cases, George Martin and EMI engineers completed stereo remixes of the albums later, after the group had left the studio. So mono, first off, presumably hews closer to the intentions of the Beatles themselves. It's what the Beatles had in mind, their vision of the records. Secondly, since the mono and stereo mixing sessions happened at different times, there are differences between the two versions, not just in the balance of the sound but also in the actual content. Different takes were sometimes used for punching in overdubs, or an alternate vocal take might make its way into the mix. Sometimes tracks were edited differently, and would be shorter or longer, and in some cases the tape ran at a slightly different speed, changing the pitch slightly. Some of the differences are subtle, and some are not. The mono version of ""Helter Skelter"", to take one example, is a minute shorter, as the ""false"" ending fadeout is presented as the track's true ending (and it thus omits the closing scream of ""I got blisters on my fingers!"") The significance of these differences will depend on the level of one's Beatles fandom; of course, those shelling out for the In Mono box will likely enjoy poring over the details. Comparing stereo and mono versions also offers an opportunity to think about changes in the technology of music listening. In the 60s, far fewer people listened to music on headphones. Music was meant to be heard through the air-- over the radio, in a car, on a jukebox, in a living room. And mono mixes were not designed with headphone listening in mind. It's been pointed out that mono records heard through headphones can sound like they are coming from a single point in the middle of your head, which can feel strange. I find that as the decade wore on and stereo mixes became more sophisticated, the Beatles' albums become less interesting on headphones when they are in mono-- the swirling pans of psychedelic material like ""I Am the Walrus"" or ""Revolution 9"" moving around are missed. From roughly Revolver forward, if I'm listening on headphones, I generally prefer the stereo mixes. Over a sound system, though, the mono mixes throughout the catalogue sound absolutely wonderful. The first four albums, however, with their extreme stereo separation, sound much better in mono in my opinion, regardless of the playback source. In any case, the sound of these remasters, mono or stereo, is exceptional. I've always felt that the sound quality of the original 1987 remasters was slightly underrated. The CD issues were well received at the time and were considered state of the art, but as the years wore on and the label never did anything to improve them, resentment set in and people began to focus on their flaws. Fair enough. But whatever you think of the 1987 remasters, these new versions are a marked improvement. In terms of clarity and detail, they are consistently impressive. But they're also successful for showing restraint. In the last few years, there's been a lot of talk about the ""loudness war""-- the tendency to over-compress and master albums too ""hot,"" so that dynamic range is squashed and peak-level sounds are pushed to the point of clipping. Fortunately, that has not happened here. These CD versions are definitely louder across the board, but there's still plenty of breathing room, so that the dynamic sound-- and these records were nothing if not dynamic-- hits the way they should. Interestingly, the mono mixes are uniformly a bit quieter than the stereo mixes, tending to fall somewhere between the original stereo master and the new one. To get geeky here for a moment, a few diagrams, so that you can see the increases in volume with the new set. The key when looking at waveforms is to take note of whether the peak sounds (which come closest to the volume ceiling inherent in digital audio) maintain the same relationship to the quieter sounds. I'm not an engineer, but the loudest sounds:quietest sounds ratio looks to me to be intact. ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" [1987 Remaster] ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" [2009 Remaster] ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" [Mono] ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" [1987 Remaster] ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" [2009 Remaster] ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" [Mono] ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" [1987 Remaster] ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" [2009 Remaster] Listening to the new masters, the differences in sound quality generally manifest in three ways: songs have more ""punch,"" with Paul McCartney's bass (an absolute wonder throughout) and Ringo's drums hitting with more force; the separation is better, so that instruments and (especially) layered vocals have more definition-- when the Beatles are harmonizing, you can more easily pick out the different vocalists, and the voices have more presence; and finally, the sound in general seems just a touch brighter, with various sound effects, cymbals taps, and so on, ringing with more clarity. The differences to my ears are not quite night and day, but they are certainly there, and they are noticeable. And it's satisfying to have these albums, absolutely some of the best-engineered records in the history of pop music, sounding as good as they can. And now, onto the music. Note that, rather than doing so for individual records, we're designating the Beatles sets as a whole as ""Best New Reissues"".

The Entrance Band,The Entrance Band,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e39d034d5c69bf33e2/1:1/w_160/24b3b438.jpg,2009-09-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13394-the-entrance-band/,Ecstatic Peace,"Just a few years ago, Entrance was one person: Guy Blakeslee, a Baltimore-born, Chicago-based guitarist.Â BlakesleeÂ cut his teeth on Fat Possum acoustic blues then graduated into full rock auteurdom with Prayer of Death, a crazy-ass collection of psychedelic guitar scribbling and acid howls. For his follow-up, he has joined forces with drummer Derek W. James and bass player Paz Lenchantin (both of whom played on Prayer) as the Entrance Band, and the rhythm section + lead guitar equation is meant to recall the Jimi Hendrix Experience. This reconfiguration from lone troubadour to bandleader is a bit confounding: Prayer of Death filtered Bay Area psych rock and Chicago-style electric blues into an idiosyncratic and compelling mishmash, and with what seemed at the time like an unwavering devotion to a peculiar vision, he most certainly didn't sound like someone who would play well with others. And he doesn't. The Entrance Band's self-titled debut dilutes the narcotic otherworldliness of Prayer of Death with jamband wankery that's far too beholden to Jimi in particular and blooze rock in general. Gone are the mind-expanding reverb, devil-may-care indulgences, tweaked nostalgia; in their place are buffed production values, noodly longueurs, ""Guitar Hero"" theatrics, copycat conceptualism. Blakeslee doesn't clean up so well. In these environs, his caterwaul sounds willfully instead of naturally abrasive, constantly threatening to slide off key but never conveying any wildman bravado. The high notes on ""Sing for the One"" sound well beyond his reach, and he sounds even further out of his depth on ""MLK"", a paean to the civil rights leader that has all the gravity of a grade-school book report: ""I remember MLK,"" he sings, ""and how I wish he was here today."" This is obviously not the fault of James and Lenchantin, who constitute a perfectly adequate rhythm section. Nor is producer Nadav Eisenman entirely to blame, although his disinfectant sheen saps the dirty rock drama from the instruments. And you can't really chalk it up to the move from Chicago to Los Angeles, even though such westward movement blanches many artists' eccentricities (see: the Band, Rod Stewart). But all of these factors combined have siphoned off the crazy and brought Blakeslee back down to mundane earth, which isn't a good setting for him. He's only a middling guitar player, but insists on soloing and showboating endlessly, drawing out songs to unnecessary lengths. ""You Must Turn"" drags on and on through an uninteresting instrumental section, then launches into an ambient outro that goes nowhere slowly. Rising and fading nicely, the slower ""Lives"" marries some watery Cure guitarwork to a blues framework-- an initially compelling combination that is eventually marred by Blakeslee's mannered howl and the band's aimless playing. Blakeslee does himself and his band a severe disservice by resurrecting one of the best Prayer of Death tracks, ""Grim Reaper Blues"", as a sallow retread, with his vocals garishly out front and with no trace of the mortal conflict that shot through the previous album. It's an unfortunate point of comparison that just shows how harshed Blakeslee's buzz has become.","Guy Blakeslee recruits a rhythm section Ã  la the Jimi Hendrix Experience and adds ""Band"" to the name of his Entrance project.

The Sub Pop Years,Damon & Naomi,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d2c0084474cd0c07f2/1:1/w_160/695c96ee.jpeg,2009-09-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13390-the-sub-pop-years/,20/20/20,"Galaxie 500 was a great group, but as usual the glory went to the guitarist. Not that Dean Wareham was much more capable a singer or musician than his former bandmates (far from it), but once he formed Luna, he did seem more naturally inclined toward the spotlight. Meanwhile, the underrated Galaxie 500 rhythm section of Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang nestled into their niche on the margins, content to call it quits but quietly prodded by some polite benefactors (among them Galaxie 500 producer and Shimmy Disc majordomo Kramer) to continue their hushed career as a duo. The pair's other prime benefactor was Jonathan Poneman of Sub Pop, who, following Damon & Naomi's debut, More Sad Hits, signed the two for a near-decade of increasingly confident releases, culminating in 2000's peak collaboration with Ghost. Admittedly, that decade resulted in a mere three studio albums, but Damon & Naomi's relatively limited output makes them a good candidate for a concise career overview compilation, which The Sub Pop Years welcomingly provides. Divided more or less evenly between The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi, Playback Singers, and Damon & Naomi With Ghost, while adding material from a 2002 tour document, The Sub Pop Years likely won't spark any epiphanies, but it does help coalesce a career that often, by design or not, threatened to float off into the ether and disappear. When Damon & Naomi get real gone, they practically vanish, and certainly as vocalists Krukowski and Yang were far from forceful, preferring to hover rather than soar. But their songs do build, gently and gradually, with all the invisible grace of a sunrise, letting in the light a little at a time until even barely there tracks such as ""New York City"", ""Tour of the World"", ""The Mirror Phase"", and ""Turn of the Century"" achieve more in terms of emotion than they initially let on. The two know their limitations but embrace them, too, with each song a meditation on simplicity almost presented as paeans to life's slow-motion inevitability. One can easily imagine what, say, demolitionist dervish Neil Young would do with a song like ""Judah and the Maccabees"". Damon & Naomi, on the other hand, deliver an epic by implication, content enough in its own austerity to let the elliptical portent seep rather than spill out. It helps that, between the studio album and the live disc, more than half of the songs on this comp feature contributions from Ghost, and particularly Ghost guitarist Michio Kurihara, who turns out to be such an oddly suited collaborator. Odd, because never do Damon & Naomi reach the heights of his legendary band (though the extended Kurihara-fied coda of ""The Great Wall"" is pretty hypnotically great) but suited all the same because he knows how to modulate his playing to support Krukowski and Yang's quiet storm. That Kurihara has stuck with the duo for its subsequent studio albums as well makes The Sub Pop Years an ideal bridge from past to present for anyone playing catch-up.","Galaxie 500's rhythm section went on to make some subtly powerful albums, and this comp draws from their output on Sub Pop between 1995 and 2002.

No More Stories Are Told Today...,Mew,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5dcb1335d7bf1698cd6/1:1/w_160/970a7080.jpg,2009-09-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13399-no-more-stories-are-told-today/,Columbia,"I've always wondered why prog rock was one of the few genres that got skipped over for a comeback. Is it just that it takes too much technical proficiency to play? Is it that latter-day prog metal bands like Dream Theater ruined it for everyone? Did the asteroid of punk actually kill off rock's dinosaurs? As someone who came up on old, (let's face it) unfashionable progressive rock, I do occasionally like to come across a new record that scratches those old itches, and Mew always seems to come through for me. The Danish trio (originally a quartet) doesn't do 17-minute epics, extended solos, lyrics about Chinese scripture, or crazy odd-metered jamming, though. Rather, they seem to have captured the exact moment when Carl Palmer, Steve Howe, Geoff Downes, and John Wetton realized prog was done for and started thinking about forming Asia. And that's not a bad thing at all! And the Glass-Handed Kites (2005), with its continuous mix and suite-like structure, nailed just about everything you could do right with that formula. Their new record, which has a whole freakin' poem for a title (No More Stories Are Told Today I'm Sorry They Washed Away No More Stories The World Is Grey I'm Tired Let's Wash Away is how it reads complete), is a hair less awesome, but it won't lose them any fans, and its poppiest moments might even gain them a few. It doesn't open in the most welcoming way-- ""New Terrain"" is half-backward/ half-forward, with instruments and vocals switching back and forth for the whole song. Playing it backward gives you a different song, called ""Nervous"". The disorientation fades pretty quickly, though, once the tangled, King Crimson-ish guitar refrain and lung-full-of-helium vocals of ""Introducing Palace Players"" kick in. That nasty riff is one of several instances where Bo Madsen's guitar playing serves as a sort of dry, dissonant foil to the music's otherwise lush, floating ambiance. Another of those songs is the other single, ""Repeaterbeater"", which, the way it kicks in with a hard rock rush before lifting off with multi-tracked vocals and high-wattage keyboards, seems designed as a follow-up to Glass Handed's biggest hit, ""The Zookeeper's Boy"". It's like ""Heat of the Moment"" if it was played by Phoenix with the Bee Gees sitting in on vocals. While these songs and a few others (""Beach"", especially) foreground the band's accessibility and odd arena appeal, they do still chuck a few knee-buckling curveballs at you. ""Sometimes Life Isn't Easy"" could contain the seeds for five songs if you cut it up. The intro is a total mindfuck, with super-high falsetto outbursts and saxophone that comes out of nowhere, but it quickly winds down with some warm synths and a gentle verse vocal backed by what sounds like a choir of children. The chorus may be the most joyful thing this band has ever put to tape. Mew show signs of trying to shake themselves out of habits, reversing their slow build approach on ""Cartoons And MacramÃ© Wounds"" by starting the song at its peak and slowly ramping down from there. ""Hawaii"" is raw and rhythmic, with the guitar taking more of a lead role than usual in the opening verse, before giving way to a xylophone solo and anthemic final movement. The same method of through composition shapes closer ""Reprise"", a song that could easily be used to re-soundtrack Blade Runner in a pinch. Over the course of a long career (they formed in 1994), Mew has succeeded in developing a good sound from some of the least hip ingredients imaginable, and No More Stories... feels like a consolidation of every stride they've made to date. I'm still not sure if the word Mew means something in Danish or they're just named after something their cat said, but I'm ready to start using it as shorthand for quality prog-pop.","Danish prog-pop maestros, here sporting an absurdly long album title, consolidate everything that's made them interesting to date.

Sidetracked,Hercules and Love Affair,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4fa13d1975652138e39/1:1/w_160/525d250c.jpg,2009-09-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13216-sidetracked/,Renaissance,"Not enough of what's written about Hercules and Love Affair talks about how they've managed to carve out two different narratives for themselves in parallel. On paper, and to many trainspotting DJ types, they're the sole invention of Brooklyn-based producer Andy Butler; this arrangement-- wherein interchangeable parts orbit around a single driving force-- is one we all recognize and understand. In the live environment, though, that dynamic isn't so clear cut. On stage, Hercules and Love Affair's many moving parts combine for a theatrical re-imagining of late-1970s and early-80s disco. That music was loaded with sexual identity politics, reclamation cries, and, ultimately, an overriding inclusivity; H&LA's forceful live configuration emanates those aspects so totally that one might leave wondering whose show it really is. This push-pull, of course, is no bad thing. More than anything, it allows for a level of dialogue between producer and live performers that most crossover dance acts frequently aim for and miss (cough, Basement Jaxx, cough). It adds dimension; Butler may be the creative force, but it's the rest of H&LA who provide the sense of community and surprise that ratifies and contextualizes his output. He's the DJ, they're the party. He's Hercules, and... yeah, you get the point. As Hercules and Love Affair's first commercial mix, the superb Sidetracked affords Butler the opportunity to step outside that feedback loop and straight-up DJ. Judging from the immediacy and sheer exuberance of this set, you can tell it's an opportunity he relishes. If last year's studied, nuanced DFA debut hinted at a talent with an impressive record collection and quietly sturdy judgment, Sidetracked cements it. With a menu consisting mostly of old-school disco, Euro house and slightly off-kilter electro, this is one of those rare sets that works every bit as equally as a party mix as it does as a sort of travelogue of influences. By the first three tracks, which sees Butler link Westbam's zippy, overeager ""And Party"" to Todd Terry's ice-cool hip-hop drum pastiche ""No Pares (Don't Stop)"" to an oblong, twerky disco-house original (new H&LA track ""I Can't Wait""-- sadly not a Nu Shooz cover), we're in full bloom. The rest of Sidetracked continues pretty much on that level, with Butler's keenly tuned ear for mid-tempo lifts and staccato breaks working across decades and continents. Early-90s synth stabs from Belgian Euro house also-rans Fax Yourself sit prettily alongside a revelatory bit of mutant disco from Brooklyn's In Flagranti (""I Hadn't Screwed Around Before""), released earlier this year. An obscure sliver of big beat from Berlin's Daniel Wang (""Zola Has Landed"") finds new life when plunked next to the proto-dubstep of Rhythm Masters' ""Oh Oh Why"". The Moroder-influenced grind of Montreal producer Gino Soccio's ""Dream On"" leads into the dainty, feather-light ""Dreaming"" from Italy's early-80s disco outfit Rainbow Team. On paper, you wouldn't expect this stuff to fit nearly so well together. This edition of Sidetracked is the first in a new series from longtime house giant Renaissance, and while one might reasonably question the wisdom of getting into the commercial mix series game at a time when the best benchmark for this sort of thing is arguably a free weekly podcast, it's hard to deny they've made a strong first showing here. Sidetracked includes a second disc featuring uncut and original versions of all these tracks, a perk that's admittedly worth mentioning only in light of Butler's mix consisting of songs you'd actually want unabridged versions of in the first place. As a first salvo, though, it's pretty hard to fault; if vintage disco, classic house, and gurning Euro house are up your street, this is as happy-making as it gets.","Hercules and Love Affair's first commercial mixÂ affords Andy Butler the opportunity to step outside the confines of his group and straight-up DJ.

East of Eden,Taken by Trees,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5db13d197565213905e/1:1/w_160/cee39e7d.jpg,2009-09-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13386-east-of-eden/,Rough Trade,"Feels so unnatural-- Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, too. The late qawwali legend has earned the admiration of singers as different as Jeff Buckley, Eddie Vedder, and Devendra Banhart. On 1989's The Last Temptation of Christ soundtrack, he also worked with Peter Gabriel, who ended up releasing six of Khan's albums on his own Real World label. With so much indie culture these past few years stuck in the 1980s, Gabe fave raves Vampire Weekend are simply the most collegiate of recent bands returning to Toto's ""Africa"" for inspiration. Khan's native Pakistan has been comparatively overlooked. Victoria Bergsman's recorded output to date is almost quintessentially Swedish. With the Concretes, she introduced Diana Ross shimmy to Mazzy Star haze, staying tuneful enough to soundtrack TV commercials. Lending her shy detachment to Peter Bjorn and John's world-conquering ""Young Folks"", she participated in a moment likely to define Swedish pop for many casual listeners the way Ace of Base or ABBA used to serve as shorthand for the peace-loving nation's catchiest export.Â Bergsman's debut album as Taken by Trees, 2007's Open Field, uses the full expanse of PB&J-er BjÃ¶rn Yttling's production (plus a songwriting credit from Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell) to evoke a gorgeously austere northern landscape, the kind of place where you appreciate the sun all the more because it shines so sparingly. So it's tempting to be skeptical of Bergsman's trip to Pakistan to record a follow-up-- all the more so given an accompanying National Geographic mini-documentary's whiff of cultural condescension. Thankfully, East of Eden suits Taken by Trees the way a shift from folk-pop to terrifying avant-classical suited oft-mentioned German antecedent Nico. Bergsman's plaintive purr can't match Khan's multi-octave ululations, and unlike the late Buckley, she doesn't try. Instead, she and accompanist Andreas SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m-- working with local musicians who've played alongside the maestro-- embrace the ecstatic peacefulness of this Sufi musical tradition's rhythms and instrumentation. Production from Studio's Dan Lissvik gives the nine-song, half-hour set an ascetic grace, sort of like secular devotional music. How very Scandinavian. In truth, Taken by Trees' debut already had a similar religious quality, albeit owing more to the introspective folk of Nick Drake; excellent remixes by the Tough Alliance and Air France showed how much those songs could gain by leaving Europe. On East of Eden, sinuous woodwind and rippling hand percussion help give plainspoken love songs like ""Day by Day"" or ""Watch the Waves"" an eternal resonance, which Bergsman's understated poise only deepens. SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m's dusty classical guitar should please Studio devotees on haunting opener ""To Lose Someone"", while from out of the swaying call and response of ""Greyest Love of All"" rises a perfect prayer for our time of endless Web 2.0 connectivity and ever-shortening attention spans: ""I hope you'll find some peace of mind."" Noah Lennox, aka Animal Collective's Panda Bear, is no stranger to prayerfulness, field recordings, or non-rock influences; that he and Bergsman would develop a mutual affinity is only fitting. After the fashion of Studio, TTA, Air France, and some of Gothenburg, Sweden's other musicians, who like to retitle and reimagine the songs they interpret, Taken by Trees transforms Merriweather Post Pavilion highlight ""My Girls"" into intimate, harmonium-humming ""My Boys"". It's a little paradoxical, recording an ode to simple domesticity in a region where religious fundamentalism led men to consider the unmarried Bergsman ""everyone's property,"" but as with any great hymn, this spirited meditation on indie-style puritanism should have the power to move even non-believers. Lennox, in turn, adds his incantatory vocals to the nylon-stringed regret of ""Anna"", where having ""way too much tonight"" can mean alcohol, fighting, or both. If you go straight long enough, somebody once said, you'll end up where you were. East of Eden, in that sense, isn't so far from Studio's West Coast: a masterful, hypnotic album that draws on a world of influences but is ultimately limited by none. So the most distracting misstep is ""Wapas Karna"", essentially a field recording fronted by a qawwali singer rather than Bergsman herself, while two other less immediate tracks are compelling mostly for their impulse toward cultural merger: the sparsely adorned, Swedish-language melancholy of ""Tidens GÃ¥ng"", which melts into ambient chirps in under two minutes, or the closing drone of ""BekÃ¤nnelse"", apparently a setting of a poem by (German) writer Herman Hesse that reflects some of Bergsman's liberal guilt. ""If you know what you want to create and are determined, you can do it wherever you are,"" Bergsman recently told London's The Independent. ""I'd rather live in sunny California.""

After Robots,BLK JKS,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5be5e6ef95969320b96/1:1/w_160/e79f4ad1.jpg,2009-09-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13401-after-robots/,Secretly Canadian,"In a vacuum, BLK JKS are a competent, at times thrilling band that is equal parts of soar and sway. But we don't live in a vacuum. BLK JKS-- Fader cover stars before releasing a lick of music in the U.S.-- have been introduced as a savior of sorts with a zippy hook: ""African TV on the Radio."" That's a fool's game and that much was clear the minute the swirl started. So they will be judged (probably not all that well) against the strains of expectation. But that's too bad because After Robots, produced by the Secret Machines' Brandon Curtis, is a hugely ambitious album, with swooping forays into kwaito, ska, reggae, ambience, jazz, prog, and furor. It's not always great-- the band has a tendency to let its best ideas get the best of them-- but there is a bigness of sound that is hard to approximate. And even harder to control. The band was discovered, in part, by (who else?) Diplo-- who came up with the ""African TVOTR"" tag-- while touring in South Africa in 2008. One year later, during their second trip to America, Curtis dragged them to Electric Lady Studios to begin recording After Robots. The enormity of sound-- often a loose-limbed rumble and shout-- always starts out well. ""Molalatladi"" is a full-on revival by minute one, roiling with a brass section, guitar solos, a sloppily mixed clatter of percussion and chants on high of ""Away, away ah-ho."" But it tumbles and tumbles on, climbing and climbing, for nearly four minutes and then it peters out. There's a lot of sparks and smoke, but few fireworks. This is a strange band, one minute rivaling the Mars Volta in bombast, the next prettily strumming about like Vampire Weekend's bolder, authenticated friends. Vocalist Lindani Buthelezi has a voice that sounds heroic when swathed in reverb, which hides some of the deficiencies, but his songs are often shrouded. He sings here in English, Zulu, and Xhosa, mixing and matching dialects on songs, turning moments of revelation on ""Molalatladi"" into opaque reflections. When things are slow and allowed to unfurl, as on the dub-inspired ""Skeleton"", Â guitarist Mpumi Mcata is able to stretch his singed chords out and Buthelezi sounds more lucid. Closer ""Tselane"" finds the band stripping away all but an acoustic guitar, and suddenly Buthelezi's quick-tongued lilt reveals a wide-eyed hopefulness. But only on the breezy psych-out ""Lakeside"" do BLK JKS fulfill promise. The vocal harmonies are tucked deeper into the mix, the guitar tones are gorgeously bright, the crescendo hits at the perfect moment. It isn't TV on the Radio-- BLK JKS don't seem to have the same knack for clarity at the right time-- but they make a powerful noise. That After Robots has been released just a scant few weeks after the runaway success of the politically-tinged South African sci-fi glopfest, District 9, is fitting. The intersection of hype, payoff and muddled message is a unique coincidence of South African cultural currents. And just as there is both hope and fear for director Neill Blomkamp's follow-up, BLK JKS have some refining-- and maybe a bigger budget-- to work on next time around.","Pushing against a mountain of hype, BLK JKS' debut LPÂ is hugely ambitious, with a bigness of sound that's hard to approximate and control.

Intuit,Ramona Falls,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d9b1335d7bf1698ccd/1:1/w_160/68e8dda4.jpg,2009-09-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13418-intuit/,Barsuk,"Ramona Falls is beautiful. Seriously, check it out on Google Earth some time. A multi-tiered waterfall in a dark glen on the slopes of Mount Hood in Oregon, it's one of those endlessly photographable landforms that makes you want to be there any time you see a shot of it. As a sort of shorthand for the natural majesty of the Pacific Northwest, the name works well for Portland's Ramona Falls, aka Brent Knopf of Menomena and a huge cast of his friends. In fact, of the various Menomena side projects, this is the one that most matches that band in terms of both sound and quality, paying meticulous attention to sonic and compositional details to emerge with a record full of memorable surprises. Sometimes it's just an unexpected element that mails a song all the way home, like the impromptu choir that suddenly emerges from the acoustic guitar and spaciously recorded drums of ""Bellyfulla"" or the unbelievably gorgeous violin part that shines like a vibrant light from the center of ""Russia"". The violin melody interacts with the chord sequence to grow more aching by the second and turns a decent song into one you can't forget. Knopf is piano player and programmer for Menomena, and he comes up with some wild stuff here, especially on ""Always Right"", where he sticks you with these bizarre, stuttering phrases for the odd-metered verses. It's offset by big choruses and a strange Eastern European-ish bridge with a carnivalesque atmosphere. More simple is ""Boy Ant"", a short piano instrumental with a sense of melody derived more from traditional European songs like ""Edelweiss"" than anything in contemporary pop sphere. Any Menomena fan will recognize Knopf's voice, which is a delicate instrument-- it's not rangy, but he knows his capabilities and uses them. He gives himself a bit of electronic assistance on ""I Say Fever"", falling down a processing rabbit hole on the title refrain, which precipitates a sudden downpour of heavy guitar. Sleater-Kinney's Janet Weiss provides the song's pounding rhythmic floor, but Knopf's own piano gives it its funky stride. Knopf's solo songs share with Menomena an ear for contrast--""Going Once, Going Twice"" swings between easy-flowing passages and lurching sections that build tension for the next rhythmic release. Intuit, a word that nicely serves as a homophone for ""Into It"", works as a title for the album because it so neatly seems to describe the writing process-- very few of the odd shifts and unexpected turns in the songs sound contrived or forced. Down to the cover art, it feels like a strong echo of everything great about Knopf's primary band. There are no cut-outs or flipbooks, but Theo Ellsworth's elaborate, grotesque illustrations are worth taking in-- they're like a combination of Where the Wild Things Are, a fever dream, a pagan woodland ceremony, and a notebook doodle. The music is worth taking in, too, over and over again.","Brent Knopf of Menomena and a huge cast of his friends get together to create a record full ofÂ meticulous attention to sonic and compositional details.

Temporary Pleasure,Simian Mobile Disco,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5da13d197565213905c/1:1/w_160/406074e6.jpg,2009-09-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13420-temporary-pleasure/,Wichita,"When it comes to making pleasure-centric middlebrow pop-dance albums, you can't fault Simian Mobile Disco's instincts. Vocalists are good. Filler is bad. Hooks are a must. Nods to underground sounds must not alienate the unfamiliar. And an approach to genre that ranges somewhere from ""catholic"" to ""aggressively eclectic"" is the only way to hold the attention of the uncommitted. Sure, judged by those increasingly out-of-date album-qua-album standards, Temporary Pleasure is something of a mess. It doesn't ""flow."" Sonically, SMD sticks to the neon thread that runs from the glittering prizes of 1980s synth-pop through Latin freestyle roller-skating jams and on into the earliest house and techno whose smiley-faced exterior wooed radio programmers. TP feels like 10 distinct singles, each pastiching a slightly different side of well-trod retro-modern electronic/club culture, connected by an album title and little else. And the disparity in quality between those singles can be pretty stark. The album also lacks the immediate replay value of the best pop craftsmanship, the kind of choruses, breakdowns, or random spine-tingling musical asides that make you rewind a track before it's finished to relive the shiver all over again. Sure, even the most uninspired femme diva material (cf. Beth Ditto doing her best bedroom-mirror Crystal Waters on the somnambulant ""Cruel Intentions"") on Temporary Pleasure never irritates like ""Poker Face"". Young Fathers' skills on ""Turn Up the Dial"" surely best anything Flo Rida's farted out in the last 24 months. But you also can't picture a single SMD song besting Billboard's current kings when it comes to the kind of dance-pop that works as well on drive-time Top 40 as it does during a club's peak hours. Less irritating than Lady Gaga or ""Low"" is one thing, but SMD would still pale next to fellow 80s fetishist The-Dream's lesser efforts. At their worst, SMD's turns toward ""songwriting"" are crass and half-assed at once, slapdash stuff that points out the mix of sweat and inspiration that goes into even the most effortless-seeming bubblegum. A truly terrible song, ""Audacity of Huge"" dares you to make it through Yeasayer's Chris Keating pulling on an ill-fitting sassy diva costume and snapping his way through an increasingly ridiculous big-spender shtick. (Swimming pool filled with grape Kool-Aid, mother-of-pearl oyster fork, bio-diesel dirigible, et friggin' cetera.) The song is a reminder of why so much electroclash stiffed on impact: A guest vocalist and sarcastic high-life signifiers do not a sure-shot jukebox hit make. Not so shockingly, Temporary Pleasures delivers more reliably on its title when it sticks to straight-up dance. ""Synthesise"" is a fierce little slice of hyper-compressed gospel-techno, somewhere between an abstract Blaze belter and Justice at their less intentionally abrasive. ""Ambulance"" is a slow-burning accumulation of acid squiggles and Emergency Broadcast System sirens that stays just on the pleasing side of shrill. But throw on SMD's best (old) single, ""It's the Beat"". Listen to how the track builds and maintains interest with good old inhuman techno building blocks-- nagging bleep, a few overlapping synth squiggles. The sampled snatches of rap are useful punctuation, but the track wouldn't collapse without them. It becomes clear that for a distressingly large chunk of Temporary Pleasures, the duo has forgotten to do much of interest with the backing tracks in favor of roping in a rolodex's worth of singers and rappers and hoping the songs write themselves. Yeah, Technotronic had Ya Kid K. But what everyone really remembers is those riffs.","A grab bag of styles, SMD's latest features Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, SFA's Gruff Rhys, Jamie Lidell, Beth Ditto, and Yeasayer's Chris Keating.

Signal Morning,Circulatory System,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4de5e6ef9596932097f/1:1/w_160/17b63616.jpg,2009-09-03 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13171-signal-morning/,Cloud,"The Orange Twin Conservation Community, the Athens, Ga., artists' colony which serves as the de facto Elephant Six compound, might as well be the Acropolis. Elephant Six effectively closed shop in 2002 and many of its flagship acts appear to have dropped off the radar. Granted, it seems Robert Schneider will never stop wringing giddiness out of the Apples in Stereo and one-time second-tier player Kevin Barnes has found a highly rewarding, well-deserved second-wind with his long-lived group of Montreal. But let's not forget that the whole effort began on the backs of childhood chums Schneider, Jeff Mangum, Bill Doss, and gregarious ringleader Will Cullen Hart. In this decade, Hart has dealt with a life-changing diagnosis, so it's a happy surprise that his new Signal Morning saw completion at all. In the Golden Age of the lo-fi 90s, Schneider indulged his Beach Boys fetish in the Apples and Mangum sculpted his Dylan insecurities into the now mythic Neutral Milk Hotel, while Hart swashbuckled with Doss a Zorro Z (or Psychedelic P) across the prevailing rock sphere with the Olivia Tremor Control. Closer to Hart's sensibilities was his subsequent project Circulatory System, a more serene group largely composed of the same OTC players, minus co-collaborator Bill Doss, which focused on some of the lusher and more experiment-laden textures often found near the stumbletine end of an Olivia Tremor Control record. But following the celebrated self-titled debut and a CD-R, Circulatory System took seven mysterious years off, the only noise being made by an Olivia Tremor Control reunion mini-tour. In late 2008, Hart revealed that one reason for the layoff was his struggle with the diagnosis and symptoms of multiple sclerosis.Â The disease had affected his mood and energy in recent yearsÂ and continues to interrupt his artistic output,Â but careful management of the disease may allow Hart years of asymptomatic life,Â Thus the understandably delayedÂ Signal Morning, the group's second proper full-length, enters an indie music culture quickly forgetting the indelible mark made by the Elephant 6. Nevermind that en vogue lo-fi groups like No Age, Wavves,Â and Deerhunter built their philosophy of bedroom experimentalism at least partly on Hart's gauze-wrapped template. With Signal Morning, however, Hart picks up pretty much right where he left off-- maybe even reaching back to OTC. As ""This Morning (We Remembered Everything)"" rolls along, cellos churn ahead of grating guitars and what sounds like a mellotron, constantly wobbling off kilter picking itself up, dusting itself off and always managing not to devolve into complete chaos (or at least, not for long).Â Likewise, Hart's lyrics have always been infamous for their tendency to invite the listener into a Gondry-esquepactÂ of make-believe. ""We"", ""us"" and ""you"" must be the most common words in Hart's palette, and they splay in full display with scattered lines like ""We still make up this world as we go along"" on ""Particle Parades"". The record's melodic songcraft, inventive yet reflective, tumbles out so effortlessly that it's almost an afterthought. Hart and his co-collaborators fashion a shambling take on psychedelic rock, flaunting experimental production that was undoubtedly intricate yet never burdened by professionalism. Think George Martin or Brian Wilson in tatters. The more compact psych-rock delivery mechanism of the Olivia Tremor Control imbuesSignal Morning hits with a breakneck pace of ideas, matching the Circulatory System's scale (which sometimes threw in sixty or more concurrent tracks). Sure, the last record noodled around with short, dense tracks just as Signal does, but it found its grounding in fully formed pieces like ""Yesterday's World"", ""The Lovely Universe"", and ""Waves of Bark and Light"". By contrast, ""Particle Parades"", ""Round Again"", and ""Signal Morning"" spin delicious ellipses, developing verses or riffs only to throw them out for stylistic shifts sometimes multiple times in a work. That's Signal Morning's greatest strength: It's a supremely busy record that at the same time doesn't sound fussed over. When the record's been seven years in the making, it's easy to assume that the output has been over-designed (see: Chinese Democracy), but Signal rings fresh. Will Hart's health might hinder his further musical output, and of course no one would deny that his priorities lie in managing his illness, but perhaps the most reassuring aspect of the record that Hart is still able to share one more piece of his gleefully damaged vision. Then again, you never know-- the E6 logo has been showing up on more than a few record covers these days, and one of the most exciting effects of the original Golden Age was that it begat a Renaissance.","Olivia Tremor Control ringleader Will Cullen Hart and his Circulatory System return after a lengthy absence with their highly anticipated sophomore album.

Diary / LP2,Sunny Day Real Estate,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5de13d1975652139065/1:1/w_160/4a4f018c.jpg,2009-09-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13411-diary-lp2/,Sub PopSub Pop,"Whether it's lifelong softies like Jimmy Eat World, strident scream machines such as Thursday, or over-their-heads windbags in the vein of Angels & Airwaves, critspeak about bands with roots in emo usually dictates the following career path: Hang with Fat Mike all you want, call us when you're ready to sound like U2. It's an easy narrative to set up, maybe because it requires fewer keystrokes than the more correct comparison: Sunny Day Real Estate. It's got nothing to do with churches of reverb or Christianity, though those would come later for SDRE. Taking the longview, SDRE seem even less of their time than they were in the mid-90s, positioned between the more stone-faced acolytes of Fugazi and the branches of Jade Tree that went mathletic or simply stuffed as many proper nouns as possible into radio-intended pop-punk (see: songs called ""Anne Arbour""). SDRE saw beyond the constraints of ""scene"" and envisioned a point where the meek would inherit the arena--- independently minded, sensitive boys doling out anthems of introspection to thousands of fist-raising, navel-gaving kids. With a hotly anticipated fall tour coming, Sub Pop has reissued the original lineup's only two records, which reaffirm what those swiftly sold-out shows already made pretty clear: a lot of people love these guys, and rightfully so. What immediately strikes you about Diary is it doesn't sound intended to be a gamechanger-- even if it's no surprise that one of emo's most enduring documents is called Diary of all things. But even if it doesn't break new ground musically, it signaled a new way to talk about the passion. The quicksilver time-changes and jangly-but-not-collegiate guitar chords show nods to Dischord, but it's the terse yet tender delivery of the lyrics from Jeremy Enigk that ultimately drew people in. ""The waiting could crush my heart/ The tide breaks a wave of fear,"" okay, fine-- this kind of stuff inspired a whole lot of heartfelt word salad from far less talented sadsacks, but ""Seven"" still is one of those great album-starters, written like they had to win you over in five minutes or it would be their last song. Immediately after, the insistently ringing two-note riff that opens ""In Circles"" portents something every bit as excitable, but to this day, I still find myself genuinely surprised as it folds into a half-time dirge. It's quite possibly the definitive SDRE song, since it's here where you hear their signature trick: Enigk is often content to softly nudge verse melodies, but the choruses are something else entirely. If the harmonies were prettier, it could be straight-up pop; if they were yelled, it might be punk. Here, it simply hits a sweet spot for people who were into shows for the community, but also to meet potential dates. The rangy, disarmingly ramshackle ""Song About an Angel"" nearly equals it during its six-minute run. If Diary has a reputation of being front-loaded, it can't be in the pejorative sense: bands can and have spent entire careers ripping those three songs off over and over again. For a while, I thought Diary happened to be an album whose importance exceeded its quality-- thanks to some unfortunately (or unavoidably) dated production, if nothing else. That's been remedied to good extent on this remaster-- ""The Blankets Were the Stairs"" no longer sounds as grounded by its granular grunge tones, and the drums sound less bogged in Green River sludge. Elsewhere, classic rock guitar heroics are more prevalent than Pac NW grunge: certainly in the memorable riffs from ""47"" and ""Round"", and ""Shadows"" played the shadow-and-light game better than any of their peers who were just dying to be compared to Led Zeppelin. Despite Diary's success, SDRE had a pretty uncomfortably defined relationship with their audience as well as themselves, so the follow-up proved to be a knottier affair, and not just because it's widely known as either Sunny Day Real Estate, LP2, or The Pink Album. The songs themselves didn't get any shorter or less intense, but they feel significantly less edified. When the charmingly animated video for ""Seven"" ran on ""120 Minutes"", it never felt too out of place regardless of whether it led into Jawbox or Pearl Jam, but LP2 tended to veer more towards the obscure. It certainly didn't help that the packaging itself contained no artwork other than its entirely pink cover or lyric sheet. And compared to Diary's untouchable opening triad, that of LP2 was bound to pale, and you feel like SDRE is playing it overly self-aware-- ""Friday"", ""Theo B"", and ""Red Elephant"" each would've been the shortest track on Diary, save for its near-interlude ""Phuerton Skeurto"". ""Friday"" starts LP2 with the kind of risky, slippery melody that all but screams ""difficult follow-up."" The high-wired guitars of ""8"" introduce damn near atonality, the kind of chords an amateur bangs out on a piano, but soon they become the backbone of the record's most muscular number. It's easy to project the idea that this was a band dissolving personally and musically from the inside-out if you know the history, but the music itself is every bit as ghostly on its own-- even beyond the threadbare arrangements, Enigk has said that many lyrics were left unfinished or sung as gibberish. LP2 certainly has more than its share of moments, but in the context of SDRE's artistic arc, a time when they wanted to be Shudder To Think instead of arena-fillers can feel like a bridge to nowhere. And that was pretty much it for the classic lineup of SDRE-- the rhythm section would play on Foo Fighters' The Colour and the Shape, a record whose brickwalled dynamics and gleaming-edge guitar arguably did just as much to determine the actual sound of modern radio rock as Sunny Day or even producer Gil Norton's work with the Pixies. Meanwhile, Enigk would put more emphasis on mysticism than mystery for 1998's amber, glowing How It Feels to Be Something On and 2000's divisive swan song (to this point) The Rising Tide. Some saw Tide as a natural culmination of Enigk's sonic ambitions and lyrical specificity, while others took Return of the Frog Queen and ""Rain Song"" in tandem and wondered when the fuck this guy turned into Rick Wakeman. Either way, it certainly deserved better than to be tethered to Time Bomb Records, which would shortly cease to exist after the release of The Rising Tide. Sure, the B-sides will generate some interest amongst die-hards, but as is the case with the recent Radiohead reissues, the sort of fans that would buy a Sunny Day Real Estate album twice probably are more than familiar with, say, ""The Crow"". But really, it might just be in the vein of so many rereleases that are meant as a reminder or a call for rediscovery-- in some circles, SDRE is Pavement, or MBV or any of the other 1990s legends you might care to mention, but a huge difference of perception is that most of their acolytes, despite making great records, are just too damn earnest to be fashionable. Or maybe it's just that Sunny Day Real Estate's influence is more conceptual than musical, and if that's the case, it's been so fully adapted into modern rock (emo or not) that it's not so much innovative as it is timeless.","A template for both emo and modern rock, Sunny Day's original lineup has its two records reissued, with bonus cuts, and they deserve reassessment.

Is the birthplace of hip-hop? Ground zero for American punk? Or does it boil down to Brooklyn indie rockers? For a legion of young bands, New York is attractive for a wealth of history you can feed on, but need not think about too much. It's the hub where blogs and social networks seem to connect, where bands flock to make as much noise for as many people as they can, as quickly as possible. Kyle Bobby Dunn-- not at all a country singer, as his name might suggest-- is part of the shadow vanguard of grave, taciturn young composers and sound artists who provide a necessary foil to the boom-and-bust cycles of the NYC hype-market, working in ways that are diametrically opposed to indie rock's vigorous self-promotion. Dunn's New York resides in the shadow of Morton Feldman and other downtown art-music titans who worked in self-effacing quietude, a debt he repays in compositions that are patience incarnate, and which, in context, can't help but sound like a rejection of blog-culture's rapid digestion and cult of personality. It's somehow heart-lifting to know that there are young conceptualists keeping the city's stern modernist spirit alive. On Fervency, Dunn himself is concealed behind the impenetrable curtains of five surpassingly ascetic drone pieces that stretch out to 10, 14, 17 minutes. This is familiar territory for fans of William Basinski and Stars of the Lid: Long tones evolve at a glacial pace, the various frequencies and timbres weaving deep patterns from palpitating oscillations. ""Butel (Kersey)"" rolls through your headphones like a foghorn, with high trembles shining through sweetly. The mournful peals of ""The Tributary (For Voices Lost)"" are complicated by an almost sub-audible bass flutter you don't really notice until it swallows everything at the end. ""Mobiles (There Is No End)"" has a skimming, insistent pulse, as if the placid waters of the first two tracks were suddenly ruffled by a fierce wind. This is part of a steady climb of intensity, which ramps up through the prismatic organ chords of ""Promenade"" and culminates in the cyclical turbulence of ""Baltic Sea Kisses (Viul Winter Remix)"". We leave the album with a sense of stunned pacifism, and only the merest intuition of Dunn's personality. Dunn is just not that interested in letting us know who he is-- the music speaks for him. Google his name, and you'll discover a volume of work that drastically outstrips its promotional trimmings. What info there is impresses: enthusiastic clips from The Wire and Keith Fullerton Whitman, and notices about fascinating-sounding live collaborations and commissions. Most of this information is related concisely and without fanfare on his MySpace page, its ghostly gray-and-white template seeming faintly embarrassed to exist just this side of the visible. The ""Influences"" section is giving over to Dunn's current listening, which at press time includesÂ Kevin Drumm, Arvo PÃ¤rt, Sunn O))), and Henri Chopin. He also specifies that he is a ""21st-century composer."" His reverence for musical history and his insistence on now-ness comprise a tacit thesis-- that the project of NYC's postwar avant-garde is far from finished. Thank goodness!","Following in the shadowÂ of William Basinski and Stars of the Lid, this NYC drone artist worksÂ in self-effacing quietude, crafting patient, conceptual works.

Welcome Joy,The Cave Singers,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d59d034d5c69bf33be/1:1/w_160/24df6f60.jpg,2009-09-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13416-welcome-joy/,Matador,"If you still think of the Cave Singers as a side project, a spinoff, a lark dreamed up by a few ex-punks with big back porches, I say go with it; two albums in, you've almost got to wonder if that's not how the Cave Singers still see themselves. Derek Fudesco, late of much missed incandescent emoters Pretty Girls Make Graves, and a crew of fellow Pac Northwest facial hair enthusiasts got together a couple years back to make an EP and then later an LP, 2007's Invitation Songs, of ultracasual folk, floaty and freewheeling but tossed off and only fleetingly memorable. Given Fudesco's hyperkinetic pop pedigree, this new thing seemed an oddly easygoing showcase for his formidable chops, like one of those dreadful early-90s Jerry Garcia/David Grisman albums that announced on the cover they were recorded over a weekend. The Cave Singers just seemed like a band who'd have to get real good real fast or probably wouldn't feel the need to do what they'd done already; that lark thing again. Yet here we have Welcome Joy, their second long-player in just shy of two years, so if this is all a goof, this bunch has an enviable amount of time to screw around. It's yet another fine and mellow set of twangy, slightly tart folk rockers, warm but patchy like a farmer's tan. Lead singer Pete Quirk's amber voice is wavering and grainy as ever, and the tunes roll by nice and easy like a pickup rattling down a country road. But from the wide open arrangements to the tug'n'tumble of Fudesco's picking to Quirk's reedy bleats never quite congealing into memorable ditties, Welcome Joy does precious little to distinguish itself from its predecessor. These tunes seem like they'd fall over in a strong enough breeze, and with songs rarely composed of more than the wispy lilt of the guitar and Quirk's slightly droll drawlery, there's not always enough to catch your ear over the whirr of the boxfan. Quirk's behind-the-beat delivery is certainly the band's strongest suit, but combined with those rusty pipes, he tends to swallow syllables whole, rendering lyrics more than occasionally indecipherable. That might be for the best, actually, given the hippy-dippy pastoralism of the odd word or two that does slip out. Fudesco's fingerwork, a product of his Pac NW upbringing, is impressively unfettered, but he adds the same little bump in the road to nearly every tune, which wears with time; at least Modest Mouse had the good sense to make only ""Wild Packs of Family Dogs"" weird, and make it only once. So not only is Welcome Joy nearly identical in tone and texture to what they've done in the past, you start hearing echoes of songs you swear you'd just finished as soon as it slides into the next; how is ""Summer Light"" not ""Hen of the Woods"", or, really, not Invitation Songs opener ""Seeds of Night"" either? The set's best tune, its title track, arrives at the end, and it's hard to tell whether it's simply a more gripping melody than what came before it, or just better due to the rough hewn feel of its demo-like presentation. The even keel can be comforting or numbing depending on your mood, but either way, it's not a sound that'd grab anybody with Music From Big Pink or even the Sun Giant EP on their shelf already. The Cave Singers' mild, moseying tunes aren't without their minor charms, and they're unfailingly good at conjuring images of wide-open fields and dust-caked lanes, but nobody wants to walk down the same road all the time if they can help it.","Pretty Girls Make Graves'Â Derek Fudesco returns to lead his fellow Pac NWesterners on their second LP of ultracasual back-porch folk music.

Their first few releases, which dabbled in electronic ambience, heavy-beat IDM, and fractured funk, were too schizophrenic to fit the moniker. But on their fourth album,Â As Good as Gone, the group sticks to gentle pushes and soft prods-- the kind that don't disturb or bruise, but are impossible to ignore. Their sounds approach slowly and rub against each other cautiously. The music is rarely sparse, and often quite full and busy, but there's no jostling for position. Everything interacts carefully, with a tap on the shoulder rather than a shove. What makes that M.O. so hypnotic is the way Nudge applies it to both structured songs and abstract explorations with equal effectiveness. Beat-less opener ""Harmo"" collects wafting synths, tinkling percussion, and soaring hums into a thick web. That's followed by the album's tightest cut, ""Two Hands"", a simmering hymn with dubby bass, jazzy drums, and singer Honey Owens' ethereal musings. Yet there's no tonal conflict between the two tracks. Instead they sound like two sides of a coin, exuding one confident, chilled-out vibe. Given their pedigree, it figures that Nudge's approach is versatile. Owens comes from the amorphous collective Jackie-O Motherfucker, and records rangy music as Valet. Leader Brian Foote was in the bubbling post-Jessamine ensemble Fontanelle; so was Paul Dickow, aka genre-straddling solo artist Strategy. Mixing together that many creative juices could cause a surplus of ideas that blur or cancel each other out. But no moment onÂ As Good as Gone sounds crowded, and the best tracks build intensity with simple tools. On ""Aurolac"", minimal beats and Joy Division-esque bass escalate to a climax, while on ""Burns Blue"" Foote's moans rise like a spirit floating above its body. The band repeats and varies these elements constantly, like characters in a play. It all culminates in epic closer ""Dawn Comes Light"", a long journey from lonely guitar up to storm-cloud drones. The only complaint I can imagine being lodged against this album is a stock criticism often thrown at Kranky records-- that its devout commitment to texture and atmosphere makes it more admirable than engaging, more studied than lived-in. In other words, sterile. But such accusations could result only from surface skimming. Dig deep, and the blood coursing through these tracks-- the insistent bass lines, the impulsive percussion, the stirring voices-- is clear. That's why As Good as Gone is Nudge's best album so far, the kind of record that indicates a band has found its signature sound, and is poised to deepen and expand it.","AfterÂ dabbling in electronic ambience, heavy-beat IDM, and fractured funk, this Kranky band has hit upon a winning combination of sounds.

Haih or Amortecedor,Os Mutantes,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d3c0084474cd0c07f6/1:1/w_160/0a72db19.jpg,2009-09-02 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13391-haih-or-amortecedor/,Anti-,"Os Mutantes were the kids of the TropicÃ¡lia movement. Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom ZÃ©, Rogerio Duprat, Gal Costa, and the others weren't exactly oldsters themselves during the movement's brief heyday, but they all carried themselves with a degree of seriousness and projected themselves as artists in a way Rita Lee and brothers SÃ©rgio Dias and Arnaldo Baptista never did and perhaps even couldn't. The trio that named itself the Mutants attacked rock'n'roll with rebellious, gleeful abandon, using homemade effects pedals and layering on wacky sound effects to cover up the bits of their songs the Brazilian military censors found most offensive. Their five albums together still sound vital and exciting today, but Lee left in 1972 and the brothers-- and ultimately just SÃ©rgio Dias-- carried on until 1978. That period of Os Mutantes isn't well-known outside of Brazil, but suffice to say it hasn't aged as well. They were as prone to prog excess as any psych band that survived past 1970, and though their music retained its wild spirit and Brazilian character, it also got tighter, more bombastic, and less infectious. Their last studio album came out 35 years ago, and Os Mutantes were a memory until 2006, when Baptista and Dias got back on stage with ZÃ©lia Duncan standing in for Rita Lee. Baptista and Duncan both appeared on the band's quality 2007 live album, but both were gone by the time Haih was recorded, and Dias reached out to a couple of old TropicÃ¡lia warriors, Jorge Ben and Tom ZÃ©, for a hand writing the songs. ZÃ© co-wrote six songs with Dias, and he proves a sympathetic partner, turning in a salad of modern imagery, biting satire, and pointed commentary for the band to sing (in Portuguese, I should add-- nothing apart from bits of ""NeurociÃªncia Do Amor"" and ""Samba do Fidel"" is sung in English on this record). The music is kaleidoscopically varied, sounding sonically like a descendant of the band's late-period records but a little closer in spirit and vigor to their 60s output. You get manic rumba on the jokingly titled ZÃ© co-write ""Samba do Fidel"", which tackles the Western Hemisphere's complex left-right politics through the perspective of Brazil's social problems, slyly sprinkling in references to Carmen Miranda and American corporate imperialism with the lines ""Chiquita banana I love you,"" and ""Yes, we have McBananas."" The brazen lampoon of sitting Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva strikingly illustrates how much easier it is to be in a Brazilian rock band today than it was from 1965 to 1978. ""2000 e Agarrum"" begins as pretty basic accordion-driven samba rock with a cartoonishly nasal lead vocal but swerves into a sweeping chorus, a morass of psychedelic carnival music and lounge lizard Latin pop. There are flourishes of non-Brazilian ethnic music, including the chunky oud riffs that open ""Teclar"" and the Arab cabaret swagger of ""Baghdad Blues"", which mixes historical stereotypes of the Middle East with imagistic anti-war commentary that never descends to accusation. New female vocalist Bia Mendes plays closer to a Rita Lee role than ZÃ©lia Duncan ever did, but she still gets in a few forceful moments-- her boisterous belting on ""Querida Querida"" as the band rocks out behind her might even be a little too forceful, and there are passages of the song that rock too generically. The band mostly keeps the passages of boilerplate funk and rock to a minimum, though, and the most straightforward rock song on the album, ""O Mensageiro"" is even a little jangly-- it's what a Brazilian R.E.M. might sound like until the heavy guitar solo comes in. The transition to that song from the Jorge Ben-penned TropicÃ¡lia throwback ""O Careca"" is unintentionally the most jarring segue on an album well-populated with abrupt and unexpected turns. My primary complaint is that Haih could have used a more open sound-- a looser approach to recording might have let some of the music's natural wildness out to play, where it sometimes feels reigned in or stifled. Haih is just as weird as their older albums; it's just weird in a much more polished way. All in all though, it's good to hear a new Os Mutantes record that carries forward the ideals and exploratory spirit that made us all love the band in the first place, even if it won't ever supplant those classic early albums.","TropicÃ¡lia legends unite for their first studio album in 35 years, which includes songwriting contributions from Jorge Ben and Tom ZÃ©.

Everything Goes Wrong,Vivian Girls,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ccea9e61561daa5207/1:1/w_160/be1af695.jpg,2009-09-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13395-everything-goes-wrong/,In the Red,"There's almost no gray area when it comes to Vivian Girls-- people either love or hate this band. For all of us who fell for their 2008 debut, there were just as many others who cried foul. Boy, did they cry. ""The singing is flat!"" ""I heard this in the 80s when it was better!"" And, of course, that most classic of put-downs: ""They can't even play their instruments!"" Such criticisms miss the point. We are talking about punk music, after all, and since when did studied musicianship become a prerequisite there? And frankly these are the same folks who will tell you that a band like Dirty Projectors is too pointillist, too proggy, too musical, so apparently there's a golden medium somewhere that I'm unaware of. So let's focus on the important stuff: Is this band doing something interesting? Do their songs sound good? On last year's Vivian Girls, the answer to those questions was a simple yes. Tell me ""Where Do You Run To"" and ""Tell the World"" aren't great pop tracks and I'll argue you until I'm blue in the face. But, sure, there were probably other factors at play in their success. The timing was ideal, for one. Vivian Girls arrived at the onset of the lo-fi resurgence-- a point when hazy guitar pop wasn't quite so, um, prominent, and when the mention of ""shitgaze"" would elicit an eyebrow raise instead of an eye roll. A year and what feels like hundreds of scuzzy records later, the band faces a thorny task with their sophomore LP, Everything Goes Wrong. Lo-fi fatigue has officially set in for many listeners, and fair or not, it feels like the band has to fight off a backlash not only against themselves but also against the genre they represent. That's a lot of pressure to put on a group that seems principally interested in playing quick-and-dirty punk rock songs about things like boys and love and loneliness. And Everything Goes Wrong generally falls in line with those simple goals. It's not a record that aims for the rafters or seeks to win over the band's haters and fence sitters. (Much less prove the worth of the whole lo-fi movement, if such a thing exists.) In fact, it's so straightforward and largely enjoyable that it kind of sidesteps the whole notion of the anticipated follow-up all together. Indeed, Everything Goes Wrong almost feels more like a third record than a second. There are no dramatic missteps, no weird forays into krautrock, just a batch of mostly solid rock cuts. But there are notable differences between this album and its predecessor. Part of what made Vivian Girls so appealing (and ultimately divisive) was its synthesis of influences-- Spector pop, the C86 stuff, shoegaze, it was all in there. But the band was always quick to shrug off those inspirations (""I actually don't like shoegaze at all"", drummer Ali Koehler once told me in an interview), and there is markedly less pop-canon pastiche this time around. If they're drawing on any particular genre now it's the thrashy hardcore they grew up on; the sound here is decidedly more aggressive (or at least faster) than before. Ramped-up rpms on ""I Have No Fun"" and ""The Desert"" are welcome, and standout ""Survival"" finds a sweet spot by combining it with sugary melodic verses. The move away from bubblegum-sticky garage rock towards classically inspired punk works both for and against the band here. On one hand the sound feels more their own, but the subtraction of some those doo-wop hooks, along with the record's darker, more somber tone makes for fewer instantly memorable moments. The band finds eventually finds its comfort zone, though. They do so on ""Double Vision"", a four-minute (!) jangle-pop cut that ends in a lovely group-sung coda, and ""The End"", the song that most closely resembles 80s blues-punk greats Gun Club, whose inspiration, if not purposefully sought after, looms large on the record. But Everything Goes Wrong's best track is also its strangest: ""Tension"" is Vivian Girls gone art-punk, and with its spiky choruses yanked from dirge-y tar pit sludge, it feels somehow like a Wire song covered in muck (a compliment, of course). And that's the funny thing about this album: It's weirdly kind of a grower. There's nothing that immediately jumps out and announces itself as the ""Where Do You Run"" of Everything Goes Wrong. Some of that has to do with the gloomier vibe of the record; its pleasures are less upfront, sneakier in a way. But under the radar is a good look for Vivian Girls in 2009, and hopefully it adds a bit more nuance to the discussion surrounding them.","Facing the prospect of following a hyped debut and the backlash against shitgaze in general, Vivian Girls issue their second album.

Songs for the New Industrial State,Doug Randle,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e9c0084474cd0c015b/1:1/w_160/ae49b488.jpg,2009-09-01 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12781-songs-for-the-new-industrial-state/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"""I think there's a hell of a good buck to be made out of solving our problems. So we'll probably solve them for better or worse."" --Doug Randle, quoted in the original liner notes to Songs for the New Industrial State. There's a funny mix of cynicism and optimism in that quotation from Canadian songwriter Doug Randle that nicely sums up the prevailing sentiment of his lone album. Originally recorded only for broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1970, the record was ostensibly given a new lease on life when the Kanata label picked it up the following year for release, but poor distribution ensured its quick trip into the recesses of Canadian music history, where it remained until now. On its surface, Songs for the New Industrial State is a sunny pop record adorned with many of the baroque trappings of adult-aimed light music records and California pop-psych, but there's much at work within that glossy interior. Randle turns his background composing music for advertisements inside-out with lyrics that carefully dissect the very methods he employed to sell things and lay their phoniness bare. In the late 60s and early 70s, lyrics decrying the artifice of a plastic world and environmental degradation weren't uncommon, but Randle does it differently, sometimes with a charming awkwardness that leaves the notion of rhyme scheme behind. He'd written musicals for the CBC, and that background is evident here, too-- the album as a whole feels something like an inversion of the industrial musicals that large companies frequently staged at shareholder meetings and sales events from the 40s into the 80s. Randle doesn't sing or play anything on the album, instead serving as the composer/conductor while steady studio hands take care of the instrumental parts. The dual vocals of Tommy Ambrose and Laurie Bower, which alternate between harmony and unison singing, give the record a distinctive, plush feel. They help to sell Randle's vision of commerce trampling nature and peace of mind amid the fanfare of trumpets and strings as surely as the lady who sang ""My Bathroom Is a Private Kind of Place"" sold American Standard fixtures. Randle's open-hearted sincerity and tendency to say exactly what he's thinking without irony means that a lot of modern listeners will have to make a bit of an adjustment for lines like ""Warm wood/ It looks like warm wood/ Touch it/ It feels like colored plastic."" ""Nicolston Dam"" has some of the album's best imagery as Randle contrasts the pace of modern life with just sitting and watching trout leap over a dam, which nicely ties in the environmental themes that are also on his mind. On the odd, harpsichord-stuffed ""One-Way Swimming"" he offers to a hypothetical partner a way to get even further from the modern world: swimming out into the middle of the ocean. It doesn't quite advocate suicide, but it does suggest that falling off the edge of the world might be a nice escape. At the other end of the record, ""Vive La Company"" is a satirical portrait of a company man and his wife who tailor their interests and conversation to help him up the corporate ladder while their children walk to school singing commercials. Randle's battle between cynicism about modern life and wide-eyed optimism is ultimately won by the latter, as he ends the album with ""Life Will Be Worth Living"". Naturally, many concerns on the record still ring true today, even if our ways of talking and singing about them have evolved as our society has moved from industrial to post-industrial. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but the album is a work of singular vision that earns its second airing through Randle's inventive sense of arrangement and to-the-point honesty.","A strange record from the early 1970s is reissued, and it combines adult-aimed light music and California pop-psych with anti-consumerist social commentary.

Alice and Friends,Box Elders,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d013d1975652139047/1:1/w_160/4f213365.jpg,2009-09-01 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13404-alice-and-friends/,Goner,"Box Elders did not take their name from an early Pavement tune. The Omaha trio honored instead the insect that infested the childhood home of two of its members, brothers Clayton and Jeremiah McIntyre. It's an easy pit for a music nerd to stumble into, but aside from the tape hiss, the McIntyres' band share little sonic DNA with Pavement. Rather, they seem to be just a few strands or family tree branches away from another set of unkempt Nuggets devotees, Black Lips. And while that comparison is awfully difficult to shake throughout much of their debut full-length, Alice and Friends, it's kind of the point. However often the lo-fi patina seems to lend what's happening musically a cozy spot in what's happening ""right now,"" it doesn't change what's under the hood: you've no doubt heard the 1960s garage surf of Box Elders before. It just wasn't theirs. Of course, if you put together enough solid hooks, none of that would matter. But Alice and Friends doesn't produce often in that department, relying instead on the kind of raw energy that fuels a good house party. Opener ""Jackie Wood"" is a 75-second study in retro that toes the line between rushed and well-crafted pretty smoothly. But as soon as the McIntyres and simultaneous drummer/organist Dave Goldberg fly into the herk and jerk of the title track, they set a rhythm and pace that creates a hell of a traffic jam throughout both halves of the record. Vocals stacked on vocals, organs on drums, choruses on verses-- with the exception of some really juicy guitar runs, there's isn't much room to breathe here. ""Stay"", in particular, leaves little impression beyond a vague feeling of nausea. ""Necro"", though opening with a really beautiful conversation between clean guitar and organ, pulls itself inside out and back again in a way that typifies the experience as a frustrating whole. No consistency. The lines ""Way down in New Orleans/ Beneath the weeping willow trees/ You lay waiting patiently for me"" might be painfully familiar, but they're heading somewhere. What starts as just another plate of sock hop leftovers turns quickly into a sweetly macabre take on loving a dead person-- emotionally or, you know, otherwise. The chorus slays, the melody allows itself to sweat some, and the song enjoys a simple twist on a formula Box Elders seem beholden to in so many ways. Unfortunately, that sort of ingenuity comes off as a song within a song. ""Talk Amongst Yourself"" is a double-time disaster nearly identical to those of ""Isabella"" and ""Cougars"". Listening on headphones is a lot like getting the spins while drunk-- a bit too much of everything. The easy sway of closer ""Death of Me"" then is truly jamming, the staggered vocal coda, ""We're going home,"" as comfortable and familiar as these guys were supposed to sound all along. Hangovers suck.","No, they're not named after the Pavement tune; though they are noisy and lo-fi, Box Elders are more enamored of 1960s garage rock touchstones.

Red,Datarock,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5065e6ef959693209dc/1:1/w_160/8b78d6e8.jpg,2009-09-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13207-red/,Young Aspiring Professionals,"Countless bands hedge their music with heaps of irony (arguably vice versa in some cases), but few buttress it with Datarock'sÂ  technical prowess. Sure, the Norwegian duo has its eye-rolling moments about night flights to Uranus or dancing with their daddies, but they also sport some of the slickest dance production in the biz, not to mention their effortless traversing between neurotic post-punk licks and coked-to-the-gills 1980s synth pop. While convention would say sophomore LP Red will have its share of ""growing up"" moments, there's already something artistically mature and high-concept about two guys jury-rigging their own sub-genre of kitsch disco to one-up the legions of more ""serious"" Talking Heads/Eno knock-offs floating around today. Red isn't exactly austere, but its lapses into wistfulness jolt Fredrik Saroea and Ketil Mosnes out of the bizarre but stable niche they carved out on their 2005 debut. As a quick glance at the track listing shows, Datarock's going pop on Red, boiling their songs down to a compact three minutes rather than going nuts with the dramatic dancefloor builds. These songs also have premises beyond shouting goofy shibboleths. There's a song consisting entirely of Talking Heads song titles (""True Stories""), an electro metal album opener about the Internet (""The Blog""), and a chilly kraut-funk apostrophe to Molly Ringwald (""Molly""), to name a few. While the lyrical craft here ain't exactly Dylan-esque, the duo shows off a level of cleverness that previously tended to level-off at wordplay and dick jokes. The (minor) drawback: Datarock didn't have to dumb things down this much to become catchier. While tightly wound tracks like ""Give It Up"" or ""Dance!"" bring the energy, they're the kind of easy-to-swallow electropop hipness you can get from, like, Chromeo, which isn't a bad thing, just that Datarock's usually a lot tougher to pin down than that. To their credit, though, there are also flashes of songs I didn't think the band could pull off. ""Back in the Seventies"" backs up its gushing nostalgia with crisply replicated plastic soul, and aforementioned ""The Blog"" soups up the headbanging outro from previous standout ""Princess"", creating an apocalyptic maelstrom of fuzzy bass riffs and soundbytes of computer pundits talking about the Internet. Datarock Datarock cooled down with two overlooked but nonetheless solid IDM tracks, but on Red the duo's softer side gets a lot more shine. ""Amarillion"" would sound at home on Saturdays=Youth, a John Hughes-y serenade full of watery guitars and shout-outs to girl-ensnaring junior high mixtape staples like ""Take On Me"" and ""(I Just) Died in Your Arms"". ""Fear of Death"" is an equally zealous 80s tribute, lifting lines from Don DeLillo's White Noise and chord progressions from Robert Smith to produce a stinging existential ballad. While it's tough not to notice the ""Fa Fa Fa"" or ""I Used to Dance with My Daddy""-sized holes in Red, you can't fault the band too much. After all, their frenetic songs sound perfect for all those video game and TV spots they've netted, and no energy's been lost in the transition from writing club-friendlier music to more conventional pop structures. Red contains no clunkers, only lukewarm forays that further convince me this band can nail any sound they want, cheekiness be damned. If the songwriting ever catches up with the stellar production and performance, they could name their next album 2 Girls 1 Cup, and people would be too blown away to care.","Norwegian dance-rockers return with a collection of songs boiled down to more pop-friendly lengths and their goofy humor still intact.

In Prism,Polvo,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c9c0084474cd0c07de/1:1/w_160/3460fd5c.jpg,2009-09-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13398-in-prism/,Merge,"The alt-rock reunions we've seen over the past decade have generally fallen into one of three categories: the notoriously combative legends who've let time-- or lucrative post-reunion guarantees-- heal all wounds (the Pixies, Dinosaur Jr.); the post-punk pioneers collecting on the debt owed to them by a new generation of spiritual offspring (Wire, Gang of Four, Mission of Burma); or the fleetingly successful 1990s-era acts who don't have anything better to do (Urge Overkill). But the sudden, surprising return of Polvo (or, at least three quarters of its original line-up) after a 12-year absence does not adhere to any of these scripts. As a band that bridged late-80s SST-schooled indie-rock and more abstract, angular 90s math-rock, Polvo's legacy feels very much frozen in time-- they're not a band whose influence is especially apparent among contemporary indie-rock acts; their popularity never extended beyond the campus-radio crowd; and there's no juicy back-story to propagate their myth. They were simply a very good band that made some very good records, and then just plain stopped. But Polvo's first album in 12 years presents a different kind of reunion rationale-- one that's less about extending a legacy as rewriting it. Like HÃ¼sker DÃ¼, the Minutemen, and Sonic Youth before them, Polvo reached their critical peak with an epic double-album statement, 1996's Exploded Drawing, which saw them successfully unraveling their bee-swarm guitar buzz to explore the polarities of their sound, from psychedelic-folk lullabies to brutalizing post-hardcore. But instead of answering their Daydream Nation with their Goo (i.e., a more streamlined, approachable set), Polvo took a hard left on 1997's Shapes, a hodgepodge of contorted classic-rock riffage and fractured-folk interludes that, in hindsight, anticipated the current vogue for Arthur-endorsed new-school psychedelia, but at the time felt like a directionless drift into the unknown, one from which Polvo never returned. Until now. In Prism thus feels like an attempt to chart an alternate course for Polvo post-Exploded Drawing, in which the band harnesses its psychedelicized sprawl into a precise, laser-focused tracklist, where even the eight-minute excursions feel brisk and purposeful. Ten years of recording-technology advances also means that Polvo has never sounded more radiant; liberated from the murky, mid-fi production of the band's older records, Ash Bowie emerges as a forceful, almost swaggering vocalist on In Prism's blast-off opener ""Right the Relation"", which, despite its cryptic allusions to Polvo's history and ethos (""We see the beauty behind imperfection... I kill my creation to right the relation"") is the band's most forthright, unfussy rocker to date. And, if this were 1997, you could easily imagine ""Beggar's Bowl"" becoming the band's crossover calling card on alt-rock radio, thanks to seismic, Led Zep-like convulsions and an uncharacteristically funky ""Another One Bites the Dust""-style break that showcases the muscular time-keeping of new drummer Brian Quast. Remarkably, Polvo achieve these breakthroughs without sacrificing any of their signatures, such as spastic structural shifts and eerie, spidery guitar leads where you can feel the strings bend. They've just organized them in such a way that their aggressive and melodic impulses complement rather than fight against each other. Of course, you'd expect a new Polvo album to deliver at least a couple of corkers. But where In Prism truly distinguishes itself-- not just as a surprisingly good reunion album, but also as the most immediately satisfying front-to-back album in the entire Polvo catalogue-- is in its quieter, headier stretches. Where the extended running times of ""D.C. Trails"" (6:57) and ""Lucia"" (8:15) may seem to indulge the band's old free-form tendencies, each is carefully constructed on an upward arc: the former cruises on a pleasingly lysergic jangle-pop tip before climaxing with a fireworks-worthy guitar jam; the diregy, doom-metal build up of ""Lucia"" makes the song's sudden transition into a melancholic, tambourine-rattled pop song all the more effective and affecting. In Prism could be the first Polvo album where the melodies leave as lasting an impression as the noise around them, with Bowie tapping into a more guileless mode of expression that rarely revealed itself before. It's only during the prolonged middle breakdown of the drifty, eight-minute closer ""A Link in the Chain"" that In Prism acquires an air of ponderousness. But by that point, Polvo's comeback coronation has been handily earned. If no one was really asking for a new Polvo album at the start 2009, In Prism's dreamy discord feels perfectly in tune with that of contemporary psychedelic iconoclasts like Deerhunter. And if Polvo's reformation initially defied the traditional logic for indie-rock reunions, In Prism ultimately sets a new standard for them: don't just make it sound like you never left, but rather make the past seem like a mere warm-up for what's to come.","Math-rock band returns after 11 years with not just a good reunion album, but also the most immediately satisfying record in their entire catalogue.

Popular Songs,Yo La Tengo,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ceea9e61561daa520f/1:1/w_160/69d79350.jpg,2009-09-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13413-popular-songs/,Matador,"Oh demon reliability! Oh demon longevity! These twin curses can plague any decades-old band in an age when careers are measured in months. Yo La Tengo can count themselves in the rare company of this group, elder statespeople operating in a genre where they're influence-grandparents. And alongside peers Sonic Youth and the Flaming Lips, YLT have to operate under the bane of their own consistency at a time when the new and a compelling narrative are over-celebrated. All three of those bands have reached a steady state where reinvention is unnecessary: They're so frequently good they don't even get a redemption story. Hell, Wavves already is set up for one of those. Fortunately, as Yo La Tengo celebrate a quarter-century of existence with Popular Songs, their twelfth album, there's still plenty to like without a PR push. The Yo La Tengo repertoire has expanded steadily over the years, and the genre experiments of years past have slowly assimilated into their creative process until it's hard to remember the mere Velvets-jacking indie pop band they once were. The easy way to draw fickle attention to your dozenth album would be a drastic makeover, but Yo La Tengo are wise enough to choose continuity over the easy angle. And as far flung as these dozenÂ Popular Songs may be, any Yo La Tengo scholar can easily trace their DNA back through their discography. Now, forget I said all that for a moment, as the opening track and single, ""Here to Fall"", is the exception to the rule. Nearly guitarless, with a menacing electric piano and cinematic strings lifted from an Isaac Hayes soundtrack, it's an ear-catcher for anyone expecting the same old same old. If there's an antecedent here, it's the treasured ""Autumn Sweater"", but beaten and wary and a little dangerous, Ira Kaplan refusing to play the kindly, reassuring grandfather: ""I know you're worried/ I'm worried too."" But it's a darkness that quickly lifts. ""Avalon or Someone Very Similar"" is upper-register psychedelia, dreamy and chipper. And when the drony keyboards and hazed-out Georgia Hubley vocals combine on ""By Two's"", we're safely back on familiar ground-- in this case the late-night dream cycle of And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out, arguably the band's last unmitigated success. Some will surely find the return trip to that well a welcome reprise, others a tired retread-- pick your side and know whether you will Enjoy This Album. Because there are more historical echoes here, particularly in how Yo La can crank out a fuzz-pop anthem (""Nothing to Hide"") or fragile, vaguely-countrified indie pop (""When It's Dark"", James McNew's ""I'm on My Way"") in their sleep. Fortunately, they don't phone it in on those tracks, and slip âem into I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One and most people wouldn't know the difference. Elsewhere, the band indulges its expanded palette by riffing on Motown, funk, and organ-boogie (not sure how else to classify ""Periodically Double or Triple""), as they've been doing off and on for most of the decade. For most bands, the costume-swapping would be a novelty act, but Yo La Tengo, who prove their cover-band chops every year on WFMU, have hung these sounds permanently in their closet by this point. ""If It's True"" is pure Funk Brothers karaoke complete with a spot-on bridge and AM-radio strings, but Hubley and Kaplan's back-and-forth duet is too adorable to nit-pick. After nine tracks, the only thing missing would be the usual YLT epic, and well, the band doesn't disappoint. In an odd bit of sequencing, all the long tracks are clumped together at the end, forming a trilogy of nine-minute-plus jams with wildly varying results. ""More Stars Than There Are in Heaven"" is the only one that could have slipped into the front half of the album unnoticed, a gorgeously unspooling meditation that suits its ethereal title. But the stark acoustic riff that makes up most of ""The Fireside"" is interminable, and ""And the Glitter Is Gone"" is 16 minutes of the usual Kaplan noise-skronk that will tempt all but the most devoted YLT fans to cut the album short. Thanks to whoever pushed them to the back, those missteps are easily ignored, leaving a 10-track record (of a more reasonable length) that can compete with anything since the band's heyday. It's easy to overlook the sound that's on display through the bulk of Popular Songs as more of the same, but it's also uniquely Yo La Tengo in a way that has taken 25 years to reach vintage status. Experience can be a crutch, an excuse to tread water in comfortable waters. But Popular Songs wears its age well, a calm but firm reminder of an indie rock perennial it's all too easy to take for granted.","The indie rock perennials return with yet another accomplished album, again reminding us why they're among the most consistently rewarding bands of our time.

One Foot Ahead of the Other,Zomby,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5cb5e6ef95969320bab/1:1/w_160/f303261b.jpg,2009-08-31 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13414-one-foot-ahead-of-the-other/,Ramp,"For an artist who led off his debut album with a track titled ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"", Zomby has a sly academic bent to him.Â  Because imposing a constraint-- Zomby meticulously crafts his music with famously difficult old Atari and AKAI machines-- is a composer's trick, however lowbrow, not an anonymous-dubstep-rave-freak's trick. New EP One Foot Ahead of the Other is Zomby's second stab at non-single formats, after last year's revivalist, acid-spiked Where Were U in 92? More put-together than a throwaway work but lacking any true coherence or an obvious standout to rally around, One Foot exists in a weird limbo. Title track excepted, One Foot mostly abandons the blank-eyed vocal samples that gave Where Were U in 92? its slurred, sloganeering (""Need Ur Lovin'"", ""B With Me"", etc.) feel.Â One Foot instead relies on Zomby's harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, kaleidoscopic melodies that, yes, sound not unlike those of a video game. This becomes a distraction early on One Foot, as ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead's Revenge"", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, serpentine programs against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a mother spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of creepy motion but very little definition. Because Zomby favors brief, bright tracks (together, ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead"" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar ""Mescaline Cola""-- as two-dimensional showpieces, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming. Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks. ""Godzilla"" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing a stuttering beat and orbital melodies. ""Expert Tuition"" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that Zomby stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of ""Firefly Finale"" feel like soft-pedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. ""Polka Dot"" may come closest to advancing Where Were U's hurried floor-sugar. ""Bubble Bubble"" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an off-kilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out. The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something One Foot almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage-- that is, ""one foot ahead of the other, slowly now""-- perhaps Zomby is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, One Foot feels like a stopgap (to wit: ""Polka Dots"" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). Zomby rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009.Â So One Foot feels like another step, finally, but only a very small one.","Dubstep star follows his excellent rave-tinged LPÂ Where Were U in 92? with an EP that veers closer to the kaleidoscopic melodies of his singles.

Disconnected,Greymachine,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ca9d034d5c69bf339d/1:1/w_160/c0af317e.jpg,2009-08-31 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13389-disconnected/,Hydra Head,"On paper, Greymachine should be great. Justin Broadrick and Aaron Turner are two of the most influential rock musicians today. The former masterminded industrial metal behemoth Godflesh; now he helms shoegazer rock band Jesu. The latter fronts atmospheric metal outfit Isis, perhaps the most imitated metal band today. Greymachine also includes Broadrick collaborators Dave Cochrane (Head of David, Ice) and Diarmuid Dalton (Jesu). Broadrick has said that Greymachine taps into his aggressive side-- welcome news for long-suffering Godflesh fans. Combined with people from Broadrick's musical present and past, such intent raises interesting possibilities. Unfortunately, Greymachine does not realize them. Contrary to hype, it is not Jesu + Isis. It has none of the pretty melodies of either. In fact, Broadrick's collaborators might as well have been absent. This sounds like a Broadrick project through and through, just not a fully fleshed out one. Songs often start with hoover bass lines-- a throwback to Broadrick's days producing drum 'n' bass 12""s in the 1990s under pseudonyms-- then wander through hazes of slow beats and guitars with loads of effects. The bass lines are bracing enough, but their power dissipates as songs go nowhere. Broadrick's production skills are peerless, and cool noises wind throughout the album. But cool noises do not make for songs. These tracks exhaust their ideas long before their running times, often eight minutes or more. The album feels like a collection of demos-- for a Godflesh remix EP, perhaps, or for Broadrick's earlier beat-oriented projects like Techno Animal or Ice. It was assembled via email, and sounds like it. The title is apt. Greymachine wastes the talents ofÂ Broadrick and Turner. Perhaps it could have been more focused had they sat in the same room and hashed out songs the old-fashioned way. Maybe Turner's melodic sense would have come through. Maybe Broadrick would have worked up actual riffs. The lack of riffing has been his greatest weakness since ending Godflesh. His Jesu and Final projects revolve around chords and melodies and textures. Sometimes these work, but often others do them better. Riffs are distillations of purpose. They occupy the midrange and can almost act like voices. Since Broadrick left riffing behind, his work has felt scattered. It often has mammoth low end, clouds of high end, and emptiness in between.","Justin Broadrick of Jesu (among others) and Aaron Turner of Isis team up for a record that the former says taps into his aggressive side.

Get Color,HEALTH,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5cd9d034d5c69bf33a6/1:1/w_160/9693056f.jpg,2009-08-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13409-get-color/,Lovepump United,"On their self-titled 2007 debut, L.A. Smell alumni HEALTH were a band going for broke, throwing everything-- noise, aggression, tribalist tendencies, spastic energy-- at the wall and barely waiting around long enough to watch it splatter. It was a nihilistic sound-- post-apocalyptic, even-- and even though you could hear distinct traces of noise-rock forbears Liars and Boredoms in their approach, the sheer energy of the thing seemed to suggest the potential for the band to carve out its own style. Fast-forward two years later and HEALTH's profile has risen considerably, thanks in part to the national-media focus on their DIY homebase the Smell, a solid remix album, and a coveted opening slot for Nine Inch Nails on one of that group's final tours. All of the pieces were in place, then, for HEALTH to blow minds and unfasten jaws with the follow-up to their first release, Get Color. And when lead single ""Die Slow"" dropped a few months back, it seemed like they just might pull it off. The thrashing, industrial-disco track was easily the best thing the group had done to date, and it hinted that they had zeroed in on a more neatly defined aesthetic using a heavier focus on melody and song structure. So naturally the big question now is if the rest of Get Color lives up to the promise of ""Die Slow"". The answer is that it does... kind of. In terms of its stylistic shift, the album is an unqualified success. Whether the result of their mixed-genre collaborations with Crystal Castles, relentless touring or plain old musical growth, HEALTH have clearly located their sound. It hinges on a more delicate balance of noise and prettiness (think the heaviest part of a My Bloody Valentine track magnified to entire-song length) and emphasizes frontman Jake Duzsik's androgynous vocals. With this revamped style, portions of Get Color reach the high bar set by ""Die Slow"". One such moment is ""Before Tigers"", with huge walls of guitar-and-drum noise that play off its whisper-to-a-roar vocals. ""Nice Girls"" is meaner and more asymmetrical but succeeds with similar contrast. Here, forceful tribal drumming sets off screeching instrumental caterwauls that seem at odds with, but ultimately blend into its ethereal, almost feminine coos. HEALTH also incorporate more electronic textures this time around, and songs like ""Death+"" and ""Eat Flesh"" find the band using intricate synth patterns as jumping-off points for brutal freakouts. These tracks rely less on melody than those mentioned above, and while usually very sonically interesting, they seem to have only one purpose-- destruction. In that sense, a number like ""Eat Flesh"" fascinates my ears but doesn't do much for my heart. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel when I listen to the song, other than that maybe everything is fucked so it's best we just rage until the sun comes up. Which is a completely legitimate sentiment (and, heck, probably accurate) but I think I was able to glean that much from HEALTH's first record. With its machine-gun drumming and end-of-days guitar shredding, Get Color's second-to-last track, ""We Are Water"" also seems to be racing towards some kind of total annihilation, a violent end. But the band takes a surprising detour by following that song up with the more pensive closer ""In Violet"", which takes a step back to survey the scorched landscape, assess the damage done, and explore the possibilities beyond the moment. It's this sort of mature downshift that seems to suggest that if HEALTH can continue to find some deeper meaning behind their very impressive musicianship, they might be onto something great.","HEALTH follow theirÂ apocalyptic debut, arguably better remix album, andÂ thrashing, industrial-disco single ""Die Slow"" with LP No. 2.

The Fine Print (A Collection Of Oddities and Rarities 2003-2008),Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c89d034d5c69bf3395/1:1/w_160/7f8e19ea.jpg,2009-08-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13380-the-fine-print-a-collection-of-oddities-and-rarities-2003-2008/,New West,"In March 1999, George Jones slammed his SUV into a bridge abutment, and Drive-By Truckers got a song out of it. Jones wasn't reeling from alcohol, nor was he being chased by an angry ex, nor did any of the hard-living country tropes play into the crash. Instead, he was simply talking on his cell phone to his daughter. He was in critical condition but recovered eventually. Which is fortunate, because a legend like Jones shouldn't go out that way. Part joking and part shaming, the Truckers' ""George Jones Talkin' Cell Phone Blues"" acts as a biopic of sorts, framing a consideration of his life and legacy with details from the crash. ""He almost stopped loving her today,"" Hood sings, before admonishing the legend: ""Better leave that cell phone alone."" That song kicks off The Fine Print, a collection of ""oddities and rarities"" that closes out a particularly productive decade for Drive-By Truckers. They were bound to get around to this kind of release sooner or later: At any given time they've had three and sometimes four songwriters in the band at once, so the backlog of unused songs was sure to back up the drains and overflow into a catchall like this one. As a retrospective, The Fine Print is incomplete, covering only 2003 onward (save a recent version of a Pizza Deliverance song). There's no Rob Malone, who left the band following Southern Rock Opera; Shonna Tucker sings only a verse of their redundant cover of ""Like a Rolling Stone""; but there are two new Jason Isbell tracks, which reminds you how naturally he fit into the group and how dynamically the band performed his songs. ""When the Well Runs Dry"" is a tense assessment of romantic and creative desiccation, and you can almost hear the mosquitoes buzzing around the languid ""TVA"", a shaggy dog story told by a backwoods lifer and interrupted by a simple, graceful guitar solo. The Truckers don't skimp on the elements that have made them stand out among the southern-rock upstarts: These songs are populated with realistic characters in hard-luck situations, soundtracked with gnarly guitars and gritty vocals. ""The Great Car Dealer War"" and this version of ""Goode's Field Road"" (from Brighter Than Creation's Dark) are two more entries into Hood's Southern crime syndicate series. Recorded for The Dirty South, ""The Great Car Dealer War"" is told from the point of view of an arsonist who burns down car lots, and Hood balances the gravity of his testimony with bits of grim humor. Mike Cooley's ""Uncle Frank"" may not have quite as strong an impact, but this alternate version of an early song does include a grim coda not included in the original, which gives the song even higher stakes. Their take on Tom Petty's ""Rebels"", recorded for ""King of the Hill"", fits so perfectly among the Truckers' original that I forgot it was a cover, and Hood updates Tom T. Hall's Vietnam-era ""Mama Bake a Pie (Daddy Kill a Chicken)"" to Iraq, fitting it nicely among the veteran songs on Brighter Than Creation's Dark. But the real story here is their version of ""Play It All Night Long"", which Warren Zevon wrote as a response to Lynyrd Skynyrd's response to Neil Young's ""Southern Man"". The Truckers wrote about Skynyrd and Young on 2001's Southern Rock Opera, so this cover acts as a sort of epilogue to that album. Plus, they fold in a few bars from ""Ain't That Pretty at All"" before throwing the song against a wall and beating it senseless with their guitars. Unsurprisingly, the rarities on The Fine Print could make a good album, but the oddities are often distracting. Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"", which they covered for Uncut magazine, is pretty much uncoverable, but the Truckers do as good a job as anyone else. The noir blues ""Mrs. Claus' Kimono"" is about unrest among the elves and reindeer, who plot to off Santa. Hood's conspiratorial tone sounds as out of place here as the song's cartoonish concept, but at least they can poke a little fun at themselves. More crucially, it adds another facet to The Fine Print, which recalls the Truckers' studio albums in its range of distinct tones and subjects: Filled with ups and downs, this collection of toss-offs and also-rans portrays the Truckers as a band that finds inspiration in the unlikeliest places.","The Southern rock band culls through its recent archives and compiles a dozen rarities on this odds'n'sods collection.

Two Dancers,Wild Beasts,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b6b1335d7bf1698c74/1:1/w_160/4ec93a48.jpg,2009-08-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13382-two-dancers/,Domino,"In a day where Hot Topic peddles guyliner to millions of male teenage mallrats, it's hard to imagine a time when glam-rock was truly shocking.Â But there remains one gender-bending device whose provocative, polarizing power remains undiminished: the falsetto-- a sound that tends to elicit both laughter and skepticism, if not outright hostility.Â Still, it remains a highly effective weapon in the endless war against safe, overly earnest indie-- and few bands brandish it so wantonly as UK art-pop quartet Wild Beasts. On the band's striking 2008 debut, Limbo, Panto, frontman Hayden Thorpe unleashed his shrill, glass-shattering shrieks as a means to project both the vulnerability and depravity of his sexually frustrated protagonists, and he didn't care if he went hoarse in the process (you can practically hear his vocal cords disintegrate on the galloping single ""Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants""). Perhaps as a means to avoid chronic laryngitis, on follow-up Two Dancers he's deferring more frequently to bassist Tom Fleming, a deeper-voiced foil in the Nick Cave crooner mold. But that's just a surface indication of the transformation Wild Beasts have undergone in the past year-- in contrast to the first album's fidgety, impulsive baroque'n'roll, Two Dancers sees Wild Beasts refashioned as a steely art-funk outfit that's no less alluring in its austerity. Granted, some old horny habits die hard-- we're not two verses into album opener ""The Fun Powder Plot"" before Thorpe hollers, ""This is a booty call! My boot, my boot, my boot, my boot up your asshole."" But his words feel less outrageous and much more ominous when set against the song's metronomic groove and melancholic jangle-- pulse-tempering measures that keep the cheekiness in check. Likewise, first single ""Hooting and Howling"" benefits from a patient, linear build that transforms the song from a quiet trill into a heart-racing anthem, with Thorpe's circular vocal and guitar lines burrowing the melody well into memory before the first chorus is out. Fans of Limbo, Panto's chandelier-swinging flamboyance may be less enthused with Two Dancers' more organized presentation, but it allows Wild Beasts to better achieve their singular balance of aristocracy and anarchy: the debonair funk of ""We Still Got the Taste Dancin' on Our Tongues"" speaks of class warfare under the serious moonlight (""Us kids are cold and cagey rattling around the town/ Scaring the oldies into their dressing gowns/ As the dribbling dogs howl""), while the two-part title track suite finds Fleming sharing a grim, first-person account of some horrible attack before the song erupts in a tribal, psychedelic surge. He could very well be talking about a public stoning in the 15th century or a gang rape from last week-- and it's not even entirely clear if he's singing from a male or female perspective-- but the lack of specificity makes the transgressions described all the more unsettling, as if they could happen to anyone. Wild Beasts certainly aren't the first rock band to stand up society's dregs and outcasts, but few others immortalize them on such a wondrous, mythic scale. And in the grand ""This Is Our Lot""-- the sort of song everyone wants Radiohead's perpetually imminent ""return to rock"" to sound like-- we quite literally have an anthem for the ages. Over top a rubbery bassline and shimmering guitar riff, Thorpe tips his tipple to the enduring passion of youth: ""We find ourselves dancing late/ Like young reprobates/ By the milky light of the mighty moon/ Find someone to nuzzle you/ And waltz from the room."" Of course, come sunrise, those kids will have to clean themselves up and get to work on time. And perhaps the more accessible approach of Two Dancers suggests a greater willingness on Wild Beasts' part to interact with the straight world. But for them, every night is still a full moon-- and when it comes, Thorpe will be ready to howl.","UK quartet follows 2008's fidgety, impulsive baroque-rock debut, Limbo, Panto, with an album that refashions them as a steely art-funk outfit.

Quest For Fire,Quest for Fire,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e6b1335d7bf1698a8e/1:1/w_160/b678f93d.jpg,2009-08-28 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13198-quest-for-fire/,Tee Pee,"""Quest for Fire"", the seventh track from the fourth Iron Maiden album, Piece of Mind, is as epic as one might imagine: The guitars charge ahead and splinter for arch solos; the rhythm forms a tight battle march; singer Bruce Dickinson is on his operatic high, draping his vibrato over every little plot point. ""Joined by quest for fire/ They searched all through the land/ Joined by quest for fire/ Discovery of man,"" he sings in his melodramatic howl, offering a summary of an early French novel and a then-recent English film of the same name. In all three quests, prehistoric tribes battle for a spark from a natural blaze, their adventures filled with animal attacks, theft, and, of course, badass triumph. Was there ever a more ready-made Iron Maiden song? Despite the handle and a self-titled debut on New York stoner-and-psychedelic syndicate Tee Pee Records, Toronto quartet Quest for Fire aren't just another metal band welding their adolescent sci-fi fantasies to British heavy metal allegiance. Quest for Fire deserve the name by maintaining the sense of grandeur of its namesakes. On Quest for Fire, finally available domestically after Montreal's Storyboard released it in 2008, the dudes stretch six songs to 43 minutes of distended riffs, patient drumming, and subtle textures. And though there are enough leaden riffs and tangential trips for the record to pass muster in the right stoner and psychedelic circles, Quest for Fire-- like the Deadly Snakes, the garage-pop bastard-greats to which two of its members once belonged-- move beyond the expectations of their form. With a two-guitar approach and mutual interests in Black Sabbath sludge and druggy dream-pop, Quest for Fire often suggest Built to Spill as much as Black Mountain or Birds of Avalon, Echo & the Bunnymen as much as Earthless. Quest for Fire generally find a good riff and grind away for five minutes or more. Sometimes they build into it and burn out in a blaze (""Strange Waves""), go straight for the throat and lash away until track's end (""Bison Eyes""), or build to and away from a roaring peak in the middle (""The Hawk That Hunts the Walking""). Quest for Fire focus more on tone and tune than technique, too, meaning that-- though the individual playing is certainly strong-- the band's a gestalt of sorts. Each song sweeps you in and moves you along, calling more attention to the general thrust than the individual performance. The solos are more functional than fantastic, working mostly to move the band from one speaker-shattering convergence to another. But there's always a little more going on than just four guys riffing in a room. Consider ""You Are Always Loved"", the album's most anomalous moment: A moody drifter of layers and contrast, the seven-minute tune centers on an acoustic guitar line so distant it feels like it's played by a ghost, and a tambourine that feels like too much of a burden to lift. A ragged electric guitar line and a steady march of cymbals and toms smolder around the broken ballad, washing past and pushing behind Chad Ross' forlorn, death-threshold vocals. It's not the only track here with creative juxtaposition or interesting parts, though. ""Strange Waves"" buries an acoustic guitar and harmonica behind its juggernaut electric lumber, adding not just texture but the sort of finesse that makes you want to listen again, to peer around the thick curtains up front. At six minutes, ""I've Been Trying to Leave"" is a relatively short barnburner. And as Ross sings, ""Follow me to the sun,"" over a steely throb, it's one of the album's most riveting rock anthems. At one point, though, they shift out of the groove and riff, downshifting into a supreme bit of weird jangle that recalls vintage R.E.M. The relationship between the guitars on ""Next to the Fire"" seems complex enough to require a compass, map, and canteen to navigate. Sometimes, Ross and Andrew Moszynski paw away at the same riff, trying to reduce one theme to a vapor of dust. One or the other eventually separates himself simply by changing tone or spinning through unexpected variations that split the difference between Mahavishnu John McLaughlin and J. Mascis. So, yeah, epic-- just like that Iron Maiden track.","Finally available in the U.S., via Tee Pee, this Toronto metal band offers distended riffs, patient drumming, and subtle textures.

A Slave's Commitment,Applescal,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c4ea9e61561daa51f6/1:1/w_160/58429826.jpg,2009-08-28 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13406-a-slaves-commitment/,Traum Schallplatten,"No sphere of music has more genre padres, underappreciated geniuses, or DJ auteurs than dance. So it's refreshing to know there are young guns in the game: A Slave's Commitment is the debut LP from 21-year-old, Amsterdam-based Pascal Terstappen for the venerable Traum label. Released as Applescal (get it?), Terstappen's A Slave's Commitment arrives after just one 12"" on Traum earlier this year (he also has four EPs to his name on different labels). A humid, pattering imagining of Traum's glittery, spiked dance music, A Slave's Commitment promises more than it delivers while announcing Terstappen's presence. A Slave's Commitment introduces not just a new artist, but new music as well: It features 11 exclusive Applescal tracks and a remix of Local Daddy's ""Sjeesh Up"". Terstappen seems deeply committed to the album as a form, as Commitment feels more than balanced (in fact, its back half is somewhat superior) and the vocals that close the ""Sjeesh Up"" remain the only hiccup in Terstappen's woozy, compressed world. It's a world built out of electronic sounds that will be familiar to fans of crossover electronic acts of the past few years. The strident, deliberate melodicism of late-90s Warp Records (the Boards of Canada-indebted ""The Forms of Abstract Life""), the trance-like pop repetitions of the Field (""The History of Love""), and the skybound synth-tronica of M83 (""Nottingham Hobbits"") are all reference points. This isn't to damn Terstappen's credentials, however--Â Commitment is sturdier and more beat-conscious than any of the above acts' records. Despite his oft-warm soundscapes, Terstappen has a bit of a bend to him. ""In the Mirror"" begins with a bass rumble and unadorned beat before adding a creeping minor-key melody, giving the track strange, noir-ish grit. ""Funk & FC"" exhibits a paranoid, skittish streak that borders on the most coherent and clear-eyed strands of (gasp) IDM.Â Commitment's standout track is ""How Heroes Die"", which behaves almost like a rock song from the flat, machinated snaps of its opening moments. From there: gorgeous, hill-like synth patches, pulses that drift over what might be a bridge, and a gorgeous, ascendant convergence of these elements before a slow fade. It's a familiar formula, and cynics might note that this kind of major-key hope-stirring (ignore the song title) is a little bit like hitting baseballs off a tee, but damn if Terstappen doesn't swing hard. There are less inspired moments: the tech-y ""Ugly But Nasty"" mostly lives up to its title and, at over eight minutes, does so for a long time. The Local Daddy remix is an odd choice for a rookie showcase, its vocals obtrusive and weird (could've been a great B-side). Committing to an album format makes a lot of sense for Terstappen, as Applescal is unlikely to thump on dancefloors. Moreover, Commitment plays evenly, even if no one would complain about an EP of remixes and extended edits of ""How Heroes Die"" or ""Nottingham Hobbits"".Â Commitment would be better if it were weirder and more singular, but for now, Terstappen's waxy, roomlit beats make for fine evening companions.","One of dance's hip young gunslingers,Â 21-year-old, Amsterdam-based Pascal Terstappen, issues his debut LP onÂ the venerable Traum label.

City Limits Volume 1,Silkie,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b8c0084474cd0c07b9/1:1/w_160/8dcf975f.jpg,2009-08-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13378-city-limits-volume-1/,Deep Medi,"Dance music fans are likely familiar with the evolution of drum'n'bass from its breakbeat hardcore roots through the rhythmic upheaval of jungle and, eventually, into the washed-out, joyless navel-gazing it eventually fell into near the end of the 1990s before UK garage stole its spotlight. That was a lesson hard-learned, so it's understandable (and fortunate) that this decade's significant beat-driven innovations from the UK have gotten only less genteel with time. Compare an early dubstep classic like one of Horsepower Productions' plenty-heavy 2001 singles with some of the outlandish stuff Joker or Zomby have dropped this year, and you can hear what it means for a genre to jump from strength to strength, advancing without diluting. Moving up in this arena means you don't necessarily need to get more tasteful-- and if you do, you just offset it by getting brasher, too. Evidence of this rarely comes clearer than it does on an album like Silkie's City Limits Volume 1. The London producer broke out big last year with a succession of singles, including the tellingly-titled ""Jazz Dubstep"", that blended fusiony sophistication with the archetypal shuddering bass wobbles and tightly-built drum patterns that accompanied the genre's mid-decade expansion. The 13 new tracks on City Limits (nine on the triple-12"" edition) sound like a wider mission statement of that style, and that this album pulls it off without sounding like an exercise in mannered noodling is a cause for relief. The best moments on City Limits perfect a certain wide-ranging formula: ethereal, borderline-ambient synthesizer chords billow like fluffy airbrushed clouds over deep skank-motion rhythms, jittery breaks, or agitated melodies that keep them grounded in body-moving turf. So while there's subtlety and refinement in the melodies-- like the fluorescent glow of the synths in ""Turvy"", or the ultra-smooth digital sax riff in ""Beauty""-- the beats knock hard, trembling inside subwoofers and pushing back so heavily you're practically forced to hear every single note in a rhythmic context. At its rawest-- ""Spark"" and its waist-winding, rave-gone-skanking rhythm; the chattering, long-arm-swinging lope of ""Sty""-- Silkie's productions sound a bit like Benga's wobbly, bristling aesthetic having Blade Runner visions. There are subtle nods towards breakbeat and jungle, too, like the choppy, pitched-up chirping vocal samples and Atari bomb-drops in ""Quasar"" that sound like they could've come from a 1994 Bay B Kane joint. And even when it all gets pushed to extents as absurd as the eight-minute ""Planet X""-- a deep churn of mousetrap percussion and tremulous, rubber-legged bass punctuated with '84-style funk flash on some Jam/Lewis business-- there's more than enough force in its beat to keep entropy at bay. Funny, then, that even with the knack for extended vamps exhibited on this album, the biggest highlight should also be the most succinct song on the record. The Mizz Beats collaboration ""Purple Love"", with its restless, stammering arpeggio bassline and thickly congealing waves of sweeping pads, is dubstep at its funkiest and most euphoric. It's almost doing City Limits Volume 1 a disservice to call it retrofuturism-- such a tendency has rarely sounded much less indebted to a caricatured past or a clichÃ©d tomorrow. And it's good to know that even in the wake of a forward-thinking genre's continued commercial acceptance, it's still possible to keep pushing the limits-- wobbling without falling down.","London-based dubstep producer blends jazzy sophistication with the archetypal shuddering bass wobbles on this excellent collection.

1 Hits Explosion,The Apples in Stereo,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bfea9e61561daa51ea/1:1/w_160/0366b2d1.jpg,2009-08-28 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13402-1-hits-explosion/,Yep Roc,"The title is a joke, except not-- the Apples in Stereo have never had a real hit, but singer/songwriter/producer Robert Schneider's long-running crew has always been attracted to the sound of hits, the aesthetics of hits, and the melodies of (specific) hits. They've just never had much time for the economic framework of hits, and although Sire co-released Tone Soul Evolution back in 1997 when it briefly looked like anything could blow up, the Apples have generally presented themselves as a DIY operation. Their home-brewed approximation of late-60s psychedelic pop is removed both temporally and culturally from the audience they often pretend they're playing to. (They've also barely released any singles: they're an album band and a live act.) It turns out, though, that isolating songs from their records and scrambling their chronology does them neither good nor harm. This best-of spanning the six albums they've made in the last decade and a half is their most straightforward record: no trippy gestures or between-song links, thanks, just Schneider's better hooks lined up end-to-end, plus a couple of showcases for now-departed drummer Hilarie Sidney. (The one non-album track is probably the Apples' most widely exposed song, the adorable Powerpuff Girls soundtrack contribution ""Signal in the Sky [Let's Go]"".) Schneider was arguably the engine of the Elephant 6 collective, the guy whose work ethic and low-budget ingenuity turned his friends' dreams and jams into actual records like In the Aeroplane Over the Sea and Dusk at Cubist Castle. His greatest weakness as a frontman is that he has nothing in particular to say lyrically (""It's gonna be all right/ It's gonna be all right, uh-huh, yeah""); the strength that covers up for it is that he's figured out all the tricks of 40-year-old psych-pop production, chief among which is keeping something new and ear-grabbing jumping out of the speakers every few seconds. (Schneider's never heard a backing vocal he didn't like, especially if it sounds like something John Lennon could have sung.) He also likes to work in stray bits of melody from 40-year-old records: the very first line of the first song here, ""Energy"", echoes Jackie DeShannon's ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"", and ""Seems So"" suggests an intimate familiarity with the Beatles' ""You Won't See Me"". The Apples' sound has been remarkably consistent over time; aside from the ELO tendencies and digitalisms that turn up on the four songs here from 2007's New Magnetic Wonder, this set could just as well document a single year in the life of a band, and it wouldn't be clear what year. (The unfancy crunch of 2002's ""Please"" is the only real nod to their .38 Special-ish live sound.) What's missing from #1 Hits Explosion is a sense of why a hitless, consistent album act needs a retrospective. If it were the only Apples record, it'd be a shock and a delight. Given that there's been only one new album by the band in the past seven years, though, it feels like a time-marking gesture-- a mixtape whose only argument about the Apples is how reliable they are.","This best-of shaves away some of the small gestures that have made the Apples a favorite, but retains their power as a modern pop band.

xx,The xx,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c7b1335d7bf1698ca3/1:1/w_160/1cf0d00e.jpg,2009-08-28 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/,Young Turks,"The xx are four 20-year-olds from South London who make predominantly slow, furtive pop music, mostly about sex. They are also one of the stranger recipients of UK hype in recent memory. They have no calling-card song; members of the Pitchfork staff have ID'd no fewer than four songs (""Basic Space"", ""Crystalised"", ""Islands"", ""Infinity"") as ""the one."" They are not fashion plates, nor likely to be. Their list of influences is potent but imperfect: Young Marble Giants (too shaggy and heavy-lidded); Japan (too robust and theatric); Glass Candy (too quick and glammy). Without one gimmick song they'll never be able to reproduce, without an alternate agenda, without a set-in-stone hip influence, the xx start to sound like a real actual band, even if, after dozens of listens, it's nearly incomprehensible to think that a group so fresh-faced produced xx. Strongly influenced by modern R&B-- the group made hay with an early cover of Womack & Womack's ""Teardrops"", while UK copies of xx come packed with their version of Aaliyah's ""Hot Like Fire""-- the xx use a drum machine to complement their copiously tidy compositions. Unlike contemporary R&B fetishists Hot Chip or Discovery, who have clearly spent long hours internalizing Timbaland, the Neptunes, and other radio cognoscenti, the xx incorporate more abstract elements of the genre: a liberal use of bass tones and an unwavering focus on sex and interpersonal relationships. Singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft in particular seems all but incapable of uttering a line that isn't a come-on, a post-coital musing, or a longing apology for a lack of one of the former. During ""Islands"" or ""Basic Space"", her voice takes on a pleasant soft-pop vibe, like Stevie Nicks'. When Madley Croft sings, during ""Shelter"", ""Maybe I had said/ Something that was wrong/ Can I make it better/ With the lights turned on,"" it's unclear whether lights-turned-on activity is sex or... something besides sex. She's not some purring kitten, though, merely reflective about a subject we don't often associate with teenagers and self-awareness. Croft's sparring partner, bassist Oliver Sim, usually fills in the other spaces via either his responsive vocals or ever-present bass. (His best trick: momentarily interrupting the divine verses of ""Islands"" with four short thumbings). Sim's voice, papery and affectless, is a sticking point for some, but pop music has plenty of room for ugly male voices, especially those with such pleasant friends. Importantly, both Croft and Sim seem like they're singing not because they have the best voices but because they have the most to say (and, purely speculatively, possibly to one another), something that would align them with an indie rock tradition as long as the genre is old, (and folk and blues long before that). Their voices provide plenty of friction, however, in the context of the xx's slight, expert compositions. Working without a live drummer, the xx manipulate airy, lingering negative space as well as any band going. Initially hospital-tile sterile, xx rewards volume and repetition like few other albums this year. Nudge the knob clockwise to hear sparse guitars decay, bass notes wobble. Amid these delicate environs, Croft and Sim can seem like they're working on different agendas, but the cagey back-and-forth on ""Basic Space"" is exquisitely timed, and the lovers' mumbles of ""Heart Skipped a Beat"", over a clacking drum machine, acquire their own weird logic. Jamie Smith (he of the ""Basic Space"" remix) and Baria Qureshi are responsible for most of the drums/loops/keyboards (and some of the guitars), and they're adept at knowing when to jump in, picking up ""Stars"" just as Sim seems to get bored with it, spicing ""VCR"", the band's quaintest, simplest pop song (""You/ You just know/ You just do""), with small xylophone melodies. That all said, the record is not a complete break with recent sounds: tune in during certain moments of ""Crystalised"", and you'll hear the flecked, staccato guitars of Interpol. ""Infinity""'s slow-strummed electric chords feel like late-period Radiohead. But xx is nervy and self-contained, the product of a new band thinking a lot harder about topics-- sex, composition, volume-- than we are accustomed to new bands thinking. It is so fully formed and thoughtful that it feels like three or four lesser, noisier records should have preceded it. The xx didn't need a gestation period, though xx is nuanced, quiet, and surprising enough that you might.","Young UK band influenced by modern R&B lands on the scene with a terrific debut, filled with seductive songs set to spare but effective arrangements.

Anti-Magic,Foot Village,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bd13d197565213901e/1:1/w_160/671b7091.jpg,2009-08-27 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13388-anti-magic/,Upset the Rhythm,"The music of Foot Village is loud, spastic, and often complicated. But it always poses one simple question: ""How much can you take?"" Not that the L.A. quartet's sound is overly harsh or even noisy. In fact, they almost never use guitars or other electric instruments, just drums and voices. But on Anti-Magic, their third LP, almost every track offers something to test your endurance. On ""Reggae War Zone"", it's a bratty ""nah nah nah""; on ""Grace's Death"", it's throat sounds that verge on graphic gagging; and on ""National Jamthum"", it's the operatic croon of lines like ""We're all on acid!/ And some of us on PCP!"" What's more, most songs here roll on past the point where you'd expect them to relent. And yet somehow Anti-Magic is not annoying, at least not for anyone who values energy and commitment. The group hurls themselves so devoutly into every second that their urgency becomes contagious. It's a trait they share with the band they mostÂ resemble sonically, the Boredoms. Their muscular multi-drumming, intricate beats, and unintelligible screams could all be conducted by Eye Yamatanka himself. But without the safety net of guitars, Foot Village can sound as naked as the characters on Anti-Magic's cover. As a result, their approach risks being grating, gimmicky, or just plain tedious. Those are dangers the band members are skilled at confronting. Brian Miller and Grace Lee come from Gang Wizard, a shambling noise group prone to bouts of glorious ineptitude. Josh Taylor was in Friends Forever, who played cartoon-metal shows from inside their tour van. Both bands had spilling, unpredictable energy, but Foot Village opts for rigorous precision. Nothing here is improvised, and it all has the feel of a ritual. So the labor that these songs require often pushes them past formality into cathartic workouts. When that happens, Foot Village's chanting voices and slamming percussion unite in one furious stomp. On ""Reggae War Zone"", Lee swings as she spurts out, ""This a war for the human race!"" Later, a male voice-- presumably Miller's-- barks in time to the rolling rhythm of ""Death of the Endless"", like a sharp horn in a sax-drums duet. And on the anthemic ""Anti-Magic"", a bouncing beat inspires the group's best invective: ""We believe in nothing/ Because nothing is what's true!"" About that belief: apparently Anti-Magic is a concept album about a war against magic and spirituality (a follow up to last year's Friendship Nation, purportedly about a land where ""our national language is drumming [and] our national pass-time [sic] is screaming""). All this is pretty hard to discern beyond a few chants about death and destruction, though the band does have a knack for pithy slogans like ""We write love songs in a secret language that no one can resist!"" But however unclear the themes are, there is definitely something guiding Foot Village through their hectic, impossible-to-leave-on-in-the-background music. That music may ultimately be more engaging in concert, judging by videotaped evidence from the Smell, the L.A. mecca that Miller helps run. But even if Foot Village's records are less essential than their shows, they're not afterthoughts. And don't be surprised if Anti-Magic's pound-and-scream ends up compelling you to turn it up rather than off.","No Age-associated drum'n'vocal band tests listener endurance on its latest collection of loud, spastic, and often complicated music.

L'Autopsie PhÃ©nomÃ©nale de Dieu,Kreng,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c3b1335d7bf1698c9b/1:1/w_160/e6d3f375.jpg,2009-08-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13392-lautopsie-phenomenale-de-dieu/,Miasmah,"Over the past few years, the small Norwegian label Miasmah Records has been heroically doing its part to make the world a slightly darker, lonelier place with a steady stream of majestically bleak ambient classical releases, some inspired by the frozen polar climes. Last year's Treny, by the Polish producer Michal Jacaszek, was a funereal wash of chamber strings and electronics, but it scans as harmlessly pretty next to Kreng's seriously nasty L'Autopsie PhÃ©nomÃ©nale De Dieu. The debut by the Belgian artist Pepijn Caudron, L'Autopsie is a harrowing bad trip of a record, a malevolent wisp of low drones, eerie, high whines, and disquieting found-sound samples. If that doesn't sound like quite the right soundtrack for your soul-wiltingly hot late August-- well, maybe keep it in mind for late February, when the ground is the same pallid color as the sky. You'll need this sort of thing then. ""Na De Sex"" opens the proceedings on a deceptively peaceful note, a piano tumbling its way down the only major scale you will hear for the rest of the album. Then, an ominous tritone-- bowed on one violin and plucked on another-- intrudes, and from that point forward, the lights shut off completely. Except for a mournful little gypsy violin figure that pops up briefly on ""Caliban,"" L'Autopsie dispenses completely with Treny's weeping string arrangements. The sonic landscape here is arid, even desolate: a single violin whispers a high harmonic; a muted trumpet bleats feebly; a brushed snare rasps like sandpaper. The instruments are separated by yawning caverns of blank space, and the effect is not dissimilar to a Webern miniature, where the silences grow so immense that you begin to be aware of your own heartbeat. To raise hackles higher, Caudron scatters a mix of deeply disturbing sound samples throughout, ranging from muffled screams and dialogue sampled from old horror movies (""Why don't you turn back into a cat?"" a man inquires at one point. ""I liked you better that way"") to rodent-like squeaking noises, to-- most upsetting of all-- the sound of a young woman sobbing quietly while Chopin's mournful Prelude No. 20 in C minor plays in the foreground. On ""Slaapliedje"", children whisper horrible, ghostly sounds into your ear. Wobbly old recordings of opera sopranos spin in a back room somewhere, furthering the creep factor. With such a haunted-house ambience, it takes awhile before you notice that Caudron actually uses a wide range of instrumentation on L'Autopsie, including cello, bassoon, and accordion. He seems to operate on the principle, however, that if the instrument can't be shrunk down teeny-tiny and made to emulate a creaking door, then it goes out the window. There are some glowing piano passages that recall Satie, and some vaguely tribal bangs and clonks in the percussion that summon the spirit of Harry Partch, but mostly, L'Autopsie belongs to its own genre, ready-made to soundtrack upcoming David Lynch films or avant-garde theater productions (not coincidentally, the surrealist theater troupe Abbatoir FermÃ© has used Kreng's music for some of its productions). Hovering like a unshakeable doubt or a 3 a.m. bout of existential dread, L'Autopsie is brilliantly sinister mood music; put it on in the background and it will surely make whatever task you are engaged in at least 30% more evil.","The latest majestically bleak ambient classical release from Norwegian label Miasmah Records, this LP helps make the world aÂ slightly darker, lonelier place.

To Swift Mars,Cale Parks,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c15e6ef95969320b9b/1:1/w_160/f19114d3.jpg,2009-08-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13405-to-swift-mars/,Polyvinyl,"There is probably some guy in your life that you like well enough but never think about. He's pleasant-looking if not actually handsome, and he usually dresses well, though he is never very flashy. He's always nice to you, and you've never heard a bad word about him. He's always just around, and you don't mind him being there, even if you never seem to connect with him in any meaningful way. This dude-- perhaps he's your co-worker, maybe he's you're classmate or neighbor-- is rather like the music of Cale Parks. This is not a judgment on the personality of Cale Parks himself, who is a man, and not, remarkable name to the contrary, a gated community. It's hardly even a comment on the quality of his compositions, which are well-crafted, uniformly tuneful, and performed at a standard well above a very generous notion of average. The selections on To Swift Mars, the Aloha member's third solo release, reveal him to be a thoughtful, subtly clever musician with an ear for low-key melodies and a mind for cerebral indie rock poetry. Nevertheless, even though the songs are objectively interesting and well-written, they are not especially engaging on an emotional level, leading to a rather hollow listening experience. To a certain extent, this is not a huge problem. Not all art needs to be emotionally charged, and there is a great deal of pleasure to be taken from Parks' cool, sterile grooves. The consistently neutral vibe of the music lends the record a degree of utility, both as background noise and as something to complement a blank state of mind. If this were instrumental music, or even some quasi-shoegazer thing with the vocals blurred into incoherent washes of sound, this would be a non-issue, but Parks makes a point of foregrounding his voice and lyrics, which indicate far more feeling than his singing or instrumentation expresses. The tell-don't-show approach has its merits on an intellectual level, and there is something to be said for exploring this sort of stoicism in song, but even the overtly melancholy ""Eyes Won't Shut"" is utterly impenetrable. Though Parks never breaks from his reserved, diffident persona, he does allow for moments when he lets his guard down enough to seem more like a fascinating enigma and less like some nondescript guy on the outer edges of your social circle. The gentle organ-based duet ""Knight Conversation"" showcases his handsome croon and sense of moonlit romanticism, and the mellow funk of the single ""One at a Time"" is emboldened by percussive fills that convey far more passion than his aloof vocal performance. Ultimately, the thing that nags about this work is the way Parks comes right up to the edge of something quite powerful and exciting, but inexplicably keeps himself from going all the way. The man clearly has the talent and the skill to do great things, and one can only hope that eventually he'll get over the timidity that is holding him back.","Aloha member comes across as a thoughtful, subtly clever musician with an ear for low-key melodies and a mind for cerebral indie rock poetry.

My Guilty Pleasure,Sally Shapiro,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b4ea9e61561daa51cf/1:1/w_160/d198d19f.jpeg,2009-08-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13377-my-guilty-pleasure/,Paper Bag,"Sally Shapiro's wilting-wallflower persona has always been as central to her appeal as the actual music that carries her (fake) name is, and that's okay. It's okay because this is one of those situations where the story and the music feed into each other and complement each other beautifully. The persona, whether it was ever really real or not, wasn't part of the noise that kept us from hearing the music; it was as central to the music as her actual voice. And anyway, her actual voice told her story better than any press bio. So here's the story: Sally Shapiro is the stage name of a Swedish woman whose real name we don't know. We don't know her name either because she's painfully shy or because she just doesn't want us to know. Before Disco Romance, her incandescent debut album, she wouldn't let strangers photograph her, and she wouldn't sing her songs with her producer in the room. And yet she and her producer, Swedish Italo-disco dude Johan AgebjÃ¶rn, got each other perfectly. He fed her airy, delicate minimal dance tracks, and she cooed over them in her barely there wisp of a voice. That voice implied so much: Sadness, nostalgia, devotion. And now the follow-up. When Disco Romance came out, I compared Shapiro to Belle and Sebastian, whose early-on reticence similarly defined them and gave their music context and weight. Shapiro's in a little bit of a Boy With the Arab Strap situation now. There's still an air of mystery surrounding her, but it's been depleted a bit. She's done some interviews, she's let dance producers manipulate her songs on a pair of remix albums, and she's even gone on a quick DJ tour. Since that tour, Shapiro and AgebjÃ¶rn have announced that touring just ain't her thing, but it's done. She's out there. She's got a Twitter, for fuck's sake. I'm not sure if I should read the general watered-down quality of My Guilty Pleasure as a symptom of Shapiro being out in the world or what, but that sense of exquisite isolation from Disco Romance is gone now. The songs are shorter and packed with more activity. The tempos are faster. Shapiro's voice is still slight and sometimes wounded, but it doesn't fully give into titanic emotion the way it did on Disco Romance [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| . Instead, it's an album of vaguely slight dance-pop songs. That's fine, but it's not great. Disco Romance was great. The good news: These dance-pop songs, slight as they are, are sometimes very good. Agebjorn is mostly working with the same materials as on the last album-- twinkly synths, vintage 4/4 drums, Moroder bass oscillations-- but he's using them to fill more space, not letting them fade into the background the same way. ""Moonlight Dance"" has slap-bass, which is weird. The pitched-up ""Save Your Love"" track is fast and bubbly enough that it could almost be Latin freestyle. These tracks gleam, but they don't necessarily sound perfectly suited to Shapiro. Often, it's easy to imagine someone her opposite (like mid-decade Madonna, say) singing over them. As for Shapiro, her voice still has a perfectly evocative quality, and so, sometimes do her lyrics. She's looking at the stars tonight and only thinking of you. Someone she loves turned her down, and she didn't feel her head touch the ground. That kind of thing. You get some of the weirdly poetic sentence-structure that only seems to come from people who aren't native English speakers: ""I walk the streets I used to live upon with you."" ""Dying in Africa"" seems to just be about being dumped, and then she drops this tiny bombshell: ""I won't get over you, even if I died in Africa."" Huh? She never tells. Well played. But My Guilty Pleasure doesn't have the same sense of character and place that Disco Romance had, and it also doesn't succeed as the straight-up dance-pop record it seemingly wants to be because the melodies aren't there. (Disco Romance would've made a much better straight-up pop record if they'd sped it up a bit.) It's a sad case of an artist forgetting what makes her great, settling for what makes her merely good instead.","Mysterious Italo-disco singer returns with the follow-up to theÂ exquisite isolation of her debut,Â Disco Romance.

Hail to the Thief: Special Collectors Edition,Radiohead,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b1c0084474cd0c07a5/1:1/w_160/cfb684b0.jpg,2009-08-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13384-hail-to-the-thief-special-collectors-edition/,Capitol,"By 2003, Radiohead were trapped in a musical era they helped invent. By that time, they had essentially completed the ideal life cycle of a rock band, rising from an intermittently promising debut to become one of the world's biggest bands, creators of twin masterpieces that captured the fear, exhaustion, alienation, and anxiety of modern life in near-perfect musical settings. There is no rock record that did more to set the tone and establish the parameters for rock music in this still-young century than Kid A, an intentional masterpiece so brimming with creativity it spawned a sequel in Amnesiac. How does a band follow that up? Well, for one thing, it doesn't try to make another masterpiece. The record Radiohead did make, Hail to the Thief, is almost an anti-masterpiece, a well-sequenced collection of songs that finds them internalizing the blend of experimental electronics and straightforward rock they wore so far out on their sleeves just a few years earlier. They basically started over, and on the record, the band sounds aware that it's peaked in a way, and perhaps less sure of where it wants to go. I hear the tension between a band that started to make the back-to-basics album guitarist Ed O'Brien so frequently mentions in interviews and a band that self-consciously want to do something new each time out and perhaps even feels guilt when it fails to innovate. They'd pushed their horizons so far already that they didn't have much exploring left to do. Confusion and apprehension are written all over the album. Just look at the tracklist: ""Scatterbrain"". ""A Wolf at the Door"". ""Sit Down. Stand Up"". ""2+2=5"". ""Backdrifts"". They couldn't even decide what to call the songs, giving each one an obtuse parenthetical co-title. When Thom Yorke sings, ""I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied,"" on ""Myxomatosis"", he sounds as though he's talking himself out of a creative eddy, and what better way to do it than over a crazed, fuzzed-out odd-metered groove? At 14 tracks and 56 minutes, Hail to the Thief is easily the longest Radiohead album, and it doesn't seem accidental that two-thirds of the way through lies a song called ""There There"", as if the band is consoling itself, recognizing that there are worse challenges than carrying forward in a successful rock band. ""There There"" has one of the album's many ambiguous refrains in its ""just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there"" turnaround, which could be taken as a brief rebuke to the anxieties expressed earlier. But what's even more striking about the song is how unremittingly gorgeous it is. It has a melody fitting for a jazz standard, but just as important is the rhythmic undercarriage. Drummer Phil Selway hardly plays a conventional rock beat anywhere on the album, here using kettle drums to give the song a distinctive buoyancy, while Colin Greenwood's bass part constitutes a second melody. Selway and Greenwood run away with ""Where I End and You Begin"", creating a rushing current to carry along the queasy synths and understated vocal. It's one of the album's few vocals that could reasonably be called understated. Thom Yorke uses his full range across the record to give voice to anger, defeat, affection, frustration, and longing. He's a fantastic singer in general, but his real strength is in the way he can latch onto a simple phrase like ""over my dead body"" and twist and pull it to mean whatever he wants it to. His most virtuoso performance on the album comes on its breathtaking closer, ""A Wolf at the Door"", where he balances a frantically paced, paranoid verse with a towering chorus. It's on songs like this where you realize that this album, more than any of their LPs since The Bends, simply lets you concentrate on a what a good band Radiohead is without distracting you with thematic concerns, conscious innovation, or attempts to force a bend in the band's artistic arc. Hail has a few low points and could probably be edited to make it that much more digestible-- apart from its tumbling bridge, ""We Suck Young Blood"" is a momentum-killer between the sinuous groove of ""Where I End and You Begin"" and the tangled loops of ""The Gloaming"" (it's also somewhat similar to the superior ""Sail to the Moon""), while the brief ""I Will"" is pretty distracting from the album's overall flow. I would've been happier with it as a B-side. ""A Punchup at a Wedding"" has a disappointingly flat refrain, but makes up for it with the funky swagger of its rhythm track. Even the lowest points have their considerable merits, though, to the point where it even bears wondering whether Radiohead can even make a bad album at this point. The tracks they did relegate to B-sides, now included on the second disc of Capitol's reissue, were certainly well-suited to their release format. ""Paperbag Writer"" is an interesting, even worthy experiment with programmed beats, a whacked-out bass line and creepy strings courtesy of Jonny Greenwood that at first sounds like an update on Martin Denny's version of ""Quiet Village"". Its counterparts sound for all the word like odds and ends. Even the title of ""I Am Citizen Insane"" sounds forced, ""Where Bluebirds Fly"" is an exercise in creating texture with almost no content, and three of the four remixes and alternate versions that backed ""2+2=5"" aren't especially interesting (Four Tet's take on ""Scatterbrain"" is the squirming exception). Yorke's piano sketch ""Fog (Again)"" is nice, and the quiet, acoustic ""Gagging Order"" is practically a throwback to the stuff they were putting on B-sides in the mid-90s, which is to say it's by far the best B-side included in the bonus material. Even if it is a cash-grab by Capitol (and who can blame them the way things are going?), the bonus disc is a convenient aggregator for the band's fans. The video content on the third disc, meanwhile, offers little you can't experience easily on the Internet. The reissue also offers a chance to re-assess an album that's oddly failed to develop a solid reputation over the years since its release-- I've heard it described as everything from a disappointment to ""their best album"" to ""too long"" to ""I don't remember what it sounds like"" by fans of the band. For a while, I identified most with the last statement-- there's no denying that Hail to the Thief took longer to settle for me than any of their four preceding albums. Time and persistence have been kind to it, though. Hail to the Thief isn't Radiohead's best album, but it doesn't need to be, either. There are other albums for that. It did, however, prove that there can be life for a band after its landmark statement, and that life sounds pretty damn good.","After four LPs that pushed the boundaries of what's expected from a rock band, RadioheadÂ internalized leftfield electronics yet embraced straightforward rock.

Wave If You're Really There,Wave Machines,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bc13d197565213901a/1:1/w_160/53ec1470.jpg,2009-08-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13396-wave-if-youre-really-there/,Neapolitan,"The full-length debut from Liverpool nerd avengers Wave Machines presents two distinct band identities. There's Fun Wave Machines, i.e., a group unafraid to break out the helium pump for Bee Gees-style vocals while tidy funk bops along in the background. And there's Pensive Wave Machines, i.e., a group of graceful cowards who adorn their endearing fears with crescendos that hint at triumph without confirming it. One of these guises is decidedly more convincing than the other. There's nothing wrong with geeks angling for some semi-awkward dance floor action, just ask Devo or Hot Chip. It's just that, on Wave if You're Really There, the groovers come packaged with singer Timothy Bruzon's ""are you serious?"" falsetto, which quickly turns into a grating tea-kettle squeal. Simply, it's annoying. Less simply, it doesn't vibe with the songs' often-defeated viewpoints and ends up undermining them. Which is a shame because upbeat numbers like ""Keep the Lights On"" and ""The Greatest Escape We Ever Made"" are sleek acoustic-pop confections with Beta Band beats that actually deserve such a comparison. There is a welcome exception: Single ""I Go I Go I Go"" packs the upbeats without the upticked voice and wins. Then there's the other half of the record, where Bruzon relies more on his natural register, a soothing instrument with just the right amount of McCartney and melancholy. These songs ditch the electronics for arrangements that are more quietly epic, as if the band is finally facing their dead and lost relationships head on. Still, they're born pacifists. And that's okay. ""Put your bow and arrow down,"" sings Bruzon on the swelling, Super Furry Animals-style title track; meanwhile, ""Punk Spirit"" finds him amusingly reneging on vicious rebellion and rolling out white flags. But even as these tracks submit, they do so with a bristling, realistic vitality; if these guys are going down (and they most definitely are), they're doing it on their own terms. Such is the moral on ""Dead Houses"", where Bruzon nearly whispers about old homes, abandoned homes, childhood homes-- but his loss is loud. One of the album's other great, slow-burning tracks, ""You Say the Stupidest Things"" comes off like a self-lashing. But it's not what this band is saying that's particularly dumb, it's just how they're saying it. And since these masochistic fellows seem fully aware of their own foibles, they should keep in mind that singing songs about having no balls in a voice that suggests you actually have no balls is a risky endeavor.","Like Devo or Hot Chip before them, this Liverpool band aims for nerdy electro-pop andÂ tidy funk on its debut LP.

Tummaa,Vladislav Delay,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bab1335d7bf1698c7e/1:1/w_160/9d6e924e.jpg,2009-08-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13393-tummaa/,Leaf,"In the interest of realness, let me say this: If Vladislav Delay had produced nothing but the ambient records he released on Chain Reaction and Mille Plateaux around the turn of the millennium, he'd be a footnote. That's not to downplay his talent when it comes to gluing his grey synth bubbles and drum thwacks into little sonic shoebox dioramas. It's just that it took the introduction of the disco pulse before Delay made his masterpiece. Even on his best ambient album, 2001's Anima, you feel like you're listening to Luomo minus the rhythm, and the lack is disappointing. Tummaa is just fine as these low-impact, Delay-branded outings go. Anyone who clicked this probably doesn't need to be forewarned, but just in case: it lacks melody (except in frustratingly haunting and brief snatches); repeating rhythms; a pretty frontperson singing about the universal stuff we feel in our squishy human parts. As usual with this stuff, you can take it straight as possible-- the tactile joy of certain noises slithering up your earhole, aka the ""wow, that was neat the way some non-musical sound set my emotions tingling"" factor-- or let it spice up the stale silences of your day-to-day. Or both. Fractured backing for your domestic micro-dramas? There is a certain early-morning calm to ""Kuula"", and its blend of quavering synth, and it sounds like someone rustling around in a kitchen while looking for the muffin tin that's gone missing. Bumper music for the world's most avant-garde nature doc? ""Toive"" will add its own not-standard animal cries and the sound of brush crushed under heavy hooves to your next nature walk. And so on. What elevates the album beyond similar outings by Delay's peers is his care. Just as with Luomo, where every vocal hiccup sounded erotically casual and machine-plotted, you get the sense these collages proceed as they do for a reason, Delay's openness to organic happenstance adding a little extra suspense to his formal rigor. This is not music made of tidy loops. It's no fun to write about this sort of post-Eno quote environmental music unquote, because adjective-heavy impressionism and quasi-poetry lurk around the corner with baseball bats waiting to bludgeon the reader's credulity and the writer's rep. So let's end things in the real world, a place that can almost always use a better soundtrack than it's got. I spent most of my time listening to Tuumaa on my porch, watching deciduous trees and off-white houses bake under the August sun in a flat, featureless patch of suburb. And it made my neighborhood-- usually so lacking in surface interest it makes Andy Warhol's Emprire look like D.W. Griffith's Intolerance-- newly entertaining for that hour-plus. While I do wish he'd release another (good) Luomo LP, if Delay's dip back into sound art can add alien color to the drab Everytown, U.S.A. street scene I confront each morning, imagine what he can do for you.","Sasu Ripatti returns under his clicks'n'cuts-gone-ambient name for a new album of loops, thwacks, and other micro-sounds.

Love Comes Close,Cold Cave,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bbb1335d7bf1698c81/1:1/w_160/161a8522.jpg,2009-08-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13383-love-comes-close/,Heartworm,"If vampires are as cool as I'm told they are right now, Cold Cave would've cleaned up at the Teen Choice Awards this year. Consider: Dark, synth-splashed pop songs with enough of an industrial bent to validate any flashbacks you might be having of watching Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie stalk the club for fresh meat in The Hunger. And though pack leader Wesley Eisold (also known for his work in the hardcore outfit Give Up the Ghost) does have the spooky Peter Murphy vocal thing down pat, Cold Cave sound more realized than the one-off pleasure project they look like on paper. By enlisting noise goblin Ian Dominick Fernow (Prurient) and Xiu Xiu-graduate Caralee McElroy to pitch in, their full-length debut*, Love Comes Close*, manages to stand out as a successful collaborative effort with a clear sense of purpose. Synth-pop, post punk, new wave, atmospheric industrial-- all these references, which came and went and were fashionable again a half-decade ago, somehow manage to feel fresh here. It's probably because the songs on Love Comes Close are consistently catchy and well constructed-- once you have that down, genre concerns become secondary. Still, these are some awfully icy landscapes, and Cold Cave do have a way with mood. Take, for instance, opener ""Cebe and Me"", which exhibits a pulsing, Ambien-addled dry cold that threatens to wear thin if over-exercised. But this track turns out to be an entry-level teaser, as album highlight ""Love Comes Close"" chimes in right on time, an inspired, bittersweet New Order-style dance-pop track that's as morose as it is curiously uplifting, constantly refreshing itself on that earworm of a guitar hook. From here on out,Â Love evens out, outfitting those creepy, dead-eyed synthetics in more pop-friendly garb. The presence of Fernow is apparent and welcome, seasoning the Human League pop pulse with big, bright slices of Throbbing Gristle abrasion on cuts like ""Heaven Was Full"" and ""Cebe and Me"". Cold Cave have the chops to be a depraved batch of noise warriors with aÂ Blade Runner fetish, but I'm guessing that those crystalline new wave hooks they're capable of were just too juicy to ignore. There's an overwhelmingly disaffected quality to this music, but in the sense that even the darkest parts have been treated with CheerÂ® Dark ColorguardÂ®. So maybe it's McElroy's vocal contributions that are to credit, sweetening dance-ready tracks like ""Life Magazine"" and the splendid ""The Trees Grew Emotions and Died"" (both of which sound much like two very reined-in Crystal Castles singles). But Eisold proves to be the noble, well-versed synth-Svengali of the whole operation, his devilish baritone channeling the vocal reticence of Ian Curtis one moment and the yearning of the National's Matt Berninger the next. True, he sometimes allows the lyrical content to wade a bit too far into chic discontentment for some (""A synthetic world without end,"" interjects McElroy on the Eastern Euro disco joint ""Youth and Lust"", ""sheds a tear of plastic deception""), but Love Comes Close is all about that world anyway and makes no apologies, so you might as well just roll with it. Besides, most of the pretenses presented here can't overshadow the sexy fun of a little black lipstick on the collar.Â Twilight fans, let's cut the shit: throw on a little Cold Cave and get down to business already.","Moody synth-poppers from Philly, whose contributors include members of Xiu Xiu and Prurient, make an impressive full-length debut.

Walking on a Wire: Richard Thompson (1968-2009),Richard Thompson,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49813d1975652138d45/1:1/w_160/461e2e6a.jpg,2009-08-26 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13129-walking-on-a-wire-richard-thompson-1968-2009/,Shout! Factory,"Walking on a Wire isn't Richard Thompson's first boxed set: that was 1993's 3xCD Watching the Dark, which compiled studio and live recordings from the breadth of the great British singer/guitarist's career (about a third of them previously unreleased) in an order that tossed chronology to the winds in favor of musical flow. It's also not his second boxed set: that was 2006's 5xCD RT: The Life and Music of Richard Thompson, which was almost entirely unreleased recordings, arranged thematically. This one is a straight-up career retrospective: one magnificent song apiece from the first five Fairport Convention records (the era in which he was the indestructible folk-rock group's full-time lead guitarist and occasional songwriter), and then at least a track or two from each of Thompson's studio albums with and without Linda Thompson (except, oddly, 2005's Front Parlour Ballads), a handful of his live records, and a couple of his other album-length projects. There's nothing from his session work with other artists, no discographical oddities, no previously unheard material, and very little regard for sequencing or musical contextualization. It's just a Man, This Guy's Made a Lot of Albums info-dump, a primer for those who have not yet been converted to this cultiest of musicians and therefore don't understand why it's an international disgrace that ""Withered and Died"" and ""I Feel So Good"" are not generally available at karaoke bars. The problem with acolytes is that we tend to go on a bit too long about our heroes, and Walking on a Wire's and-then-he-made-this-record enthusiasm turns exhausting over the course of four discs. (Including six songs from 1974's epochal I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight was a good idea. Including six songs from 1994's shaky Mirror Blue wasn't. The five songs from his two collaborations with Danny Thompson are at least four and a half too many.) Song for song, though, there's a lot of remarkable stuff here. In particular, the first two discs (which go up to 1985's Across a Crowded Room) aren't faultless, but they're fantastic. Thompson had an old man's gravitas from the get-go-- Fairport's ""Meet on the Ledge"" is probably the most emotionally weathered looking-back-at-youth song ever written by a 20-year-old-- and the six albums he made with Linda anchor their precision-tooled craftsmanship and erotic tension with the deeper resonances of the British folk music that's always informed Thompson's songs. The second half of the box is spottier, not because Thompson lost his songwriting mojo altogether-- ""Gethsemane"" and ""Beeswing"" are right up there among the peaks of his repertoire-- but because the split with Linda was roughly the point at which Thompson the songwriter began to stiffen and peel apart from Thompson the guitarist and live performer. (The big-bang production of his 80s and early-90s records hasn't aged well, either.) One thing he lost when he no longer had a woman to sing his words was an easy cue that his lyrics might not be a direct expression of his own experience, so they shifted more toward obvious fictions and character sketches as his singing grew more mannered. ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"", Thompson's best-loved post-Linda song, presents the singer as a storyteller, entirely detached from his subject, where Linda and Sandy Denny always found a way into his narratives. And 1991's ""Read About Love"" is as vivacious and catchy as any other power-pop song of its era, but it's unbecomingly condescending to its narrator: ""When I touch you there it's supposed to feel nice/ That's what it said in Readers' Advice."" The highlights of the final disc are excerpts from the live records Thompson's been cranking out through his own label since the mid-90s and selling at concerts, especially a scintillating acoustic dash through the Who's ""A Legal Matter"" and a 12-minute, solo-heavy, roof-blowing-off version of ""Hard On Me"". (The acolytes, of course, are always the ones who get access to the best stuff.) The set is the closest thing Thompson's got to the career-spanning greatest-hits album he deserves-- but if you're not already part of his cult, it's more a moat than a drawbridge.","4xCD retrospective of cult-favorite British singer/guitarist's work is the closest thing to the career-spanning greatest-hits album he deserves.

Amnesiac: Special Collectors Edition,Radiohead,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c0b1335d7bf1698c90/1:1/w_160/ce861b5f.jpg,2009-08-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13407-amnesiac-special-collectors-edition/,Capitol,"You've released a series of masterpieces in a row, each more challenging and rewarding than the last. You're being called the greatest band in the world, and many want you to become the biggest. You've been charged with uniting and possibly leading a large group of listeners who spent the late-1990s exploring some combination of the outrÃ© genres of post-rock, IDM, exotica, TropicÃ¡lia, and French house; the emotionally resonant yet textural sounds of artists like BjÃ¶rk, the Verve, Beck, Stereolab, and Spiritualized; and the once-potent but now flagging spheres of rave, jungle, and techno. In short, there's a hell of a lot of pressure on you. Whether prescient or just fortunate, Radiohead never had to create a new set of songs under the weight of these expectations. Instead, they followed the instant-classic Kid A with what they had planned to do from the start: Relatively quickly issue another set of songs recorded at the same time, a lengthy studio-bound period that ate up much of 2000. Appearing nine months after Kid A, Amnesiac faced an uphill climb as steep as the icy mountains that adorned the earlier record's cover. And so it was that the record was met with derisive ""Kid B"" jokes, sniffed at as pretentious, or considered the work of a band that had moved a little too far to the left. In the face of choosing between the forward-looking sounds of Radiohead and the revivalism hailed as the New Rock Revolution, a lot of listeners and critics chose the easy way out. Eventually, later in the decade, artists like the Knife, Animal Collective, Liars, and LCD Soundsystem would carry the mantle of blending genres and upsetting listener expectations in rewarding ways. But in 2001, in an era when the radio and MTV were still the primary delivery systems for new music-- and after the majors felt burned by electronica, or by U2 and Smashing Pumpkins' ahead-of-the-game attempts to experiment with electronics in a stadium-rock setting-- creatively ambitious guitar music was still considered a commercial misstep. Amnesiac was in some ways another leap beyond Kid A, an album that already was heavily influenced by experimental electronic music, 20th century classical, and ambient music, and often featured the manipulation of singer Thom Yorke's voice and found Jonny Greenwood ditching his guitar for a compositional electronic instrument called the Ondes Martenot. To a generation raised on Pearl Jam and Oasis, it wasn't always easy listening. Three other things handicapped the record from the go: First, the belief that, because these songs were released after those on Kid A, the band felt they were inferior, which has never been the case. Second, in order to ensure Amnesiac's summer 2001 release, Kid A wasn't promoted in a traditional manner: No singles were officially pulled from the record, and no videos were created. The band commissioned a series of online ""blips,"" short films that preceded the record's release, but because the LP wasn't being milked for extra product it appeared to be a unique, complete piece unsullied by scrupulous promotion or overexposure. If you wanted to listen to Kid A, you listened to the CD, at a time of your choosing, generally front to back. As Rob Mitchum said in his review yesterday, for many, it was virtually the last record they engaged with in this way. Amnesiac, by contrast, was promoted with singles, which gave it an aura of both ordinariness compared to Kid A and gave the impression that the band itself, threatening even then to dismantle the received wisdom about how to record, promote, and release music in the digital age, had caved to the wishes of their label. More than all that, however, Amnesiac is the first album I can remember most everyone I know getting online in bits and pieces. In the slipstream between encoding mp3s and records leaking in full, songs would tend to dribble out one by one. For a record like Amnesiac, this was particularly disadvantageous. The word on Kid A was already that it flowed so perfectly as an album (which is half-true: Like Daft Punk's Discovery, also out that year, its first half does. But then each CD featured a palate-cleansing instrumental and a more traditional second half which, other than their respective finales, could have been arranged in arguably any order.) For Amnesiac, the tracklisting is important because of the tension it creates rather than the comfortable way in which it flows. As a result, there are a number of songs that work as experiments or filling between more traditional pieces, and these tracks' power is heightened when you listen to the record straight through. When you've spent 30 minutes to download a song, you don't want to hear something like Robert Fripp homage ""Hunting Bears"" or leftfield excursions like ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" or ""Like Spinning Plates"". They work just fine as standalone songs to my mind, but many in 2001, upon first encountering them, felt cheated.Â No more so than with the band's decision to release a second version of Kid A's ""Morning Bell"". At the peak of the bloated CD era, when a record is already a ""mere"" 44 minutes long, spending three of those precious minutes re-working a song from your previous album wasn't a popular move. Yet despite the supposed arm's-length coldness of Amnesiac, it's an emotionally resonant and often very warm record. When the group aims for rich, tonal undercurrents of sound beneath swelling, heart-lifting arrangements, on Amnesiac the songs are less likely to be buffered by electronic crackles and pops or swirling strings. The difference is most notable in that second version of ""Morning Bell"", but pick any of the album's more glacial, atmospheric songs and you have the blueprint for the band today. ""Pyramid Song"" and ""You and Whose Army?"" surely, but even rhythmic, vibrant songs like ""I Might Be Wrong"" and ""Dollars & Cents"" sound like the itchy, impatient way in which Radiohead today balance their rock and electronic impulses. As a whole, the friction within a song like ""I Might Be Wrong"" is played out on a grand scale, heightened by some of Yorke's more aggressive lyrics. After the evocative, often lonesome and disconnected lyrics of Kid A, Amnesiac's snap more clearly into place and often are pointed or defensive. ""You and Whose Army?"" and ""Knives Out"" on their surface carry tinges of violence, while elsewhere Yorke pleads for people ""to get off [his] case"" or threatens to ""crack your little souls."" The strains of paranoia that had run throughout Yorke's songs for a half-decade came most sharply into view on album closer, ""Life in a Glasshouse"", which oddly seems to predict the post-9/11 Bush administration's misguided warmongering (in Iraq), belief that patriotism is equated with obedience, and willingness to trade liberty if they believe it will bring security. The only song on Amnesiac recorded after the release of Kid A, it would also have been the only song recorded after the election of Bush, and with its stately, funereal New Orleans jazz arrangement it provides an earthy, traditional close to the forward-looking Kid A/Amnesiac. Released again, with its grab bag of B-sides-- some more interesting than lovable, but all worth hearing-- and a few songs recorded in a Paris studio (all reconstructed enough to make them worthwhile, if a bit sterile at times in this environment), Amnesiac can ideally take its rightful place among Radiohead's acknowledged classics. More than Kid A-- and maybe more than any other LP of its time-- Amnesiac is the kickoff of a messy, rewarding era in which rather than owning records that were of a piece, we listen and engage with a wide variety of sounds in jumbled, sometimes confusing ways. And Amnesiac sounds like what the dawn of the mp3 era sounded like: disconnected, self-aware, tense, eclectic, head-turning-- an overload of good ideas inhibited by rules, restrictions, and conventional wisdom.","Met with confusion back in 2001, just nine months after the landmark Kid A, Amnesiac can take its rightful place among Radiohead's classics.

Posthumous Success,Tom Brosseau,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a495b1335d7bf16989d1/1:1/w_160/b6342d26.jpg,2009-08-25 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13127-posthumous-success/,Fat Cat,"Tom Brosseau's back story may be straight out of the Dust Bowl era-- North Dakota troubadour strikes out from his home town of Grand Forks to find his fame and fortune following the devastating floods of 1997-- but back stories can be deceiving. In fact, Brosseau's proven himself hip and adventurous enough to effortlessly hob-knob with L.A.'s elite, equally imbued as he is by Woody Guthrie's folk wanderlust, Cole Porter's cosmopolitan class, and even Jeff Buckley's arty otherworldliness. Indeed, Brosseau's the sort of artist whose simple, strikingly unadorned songs and high, lonesome vocals could probably be fit to shape if not any occasion than certainly any time and place. Still, one gets the sense Brosseau may have nonetheless played his true nature close to the vest. Albums like What I Mean to Say Is Goodbye and Cavalier feature their share of tasteful musical flourishes, but by and large those discs remain spare, almost skeletal in their execution, as if Brosseau were still waiting for the right body to hang on those bones. Posthumous Success (which takes its name from a chapter of a Camus bio but its self-deprecating wit from The Late, Great Townes Van Zandt) isn't quite the coming-out party it's being presented as, but it does find Brosseau expanding his sonic palette while retaining the lyrical (both literal and figurative) qualities that have made him a quietly special performer and singer. He's the type of guy who can casually reference Dave Grohl, Vincent Price, and Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood protagonist Hazel Motes without waving the red flag of pretension, let alone breaking the slightly surreal, waking-dream quality of the music he's so carefully fostered. Minus that deceptively unaffected voice, a song like ""Big Time"" might come across as bluster. Instead, anchored by Brosseau's nuanced delivery it feels oddly innocent, even bittersweet. Similarly, in ""Been True"", Brosseau's voice vies with trebly interlocking guitars, the tone vacillating between melancholy and hopeful. Even the cacophony of ""You Don't Know My Friends"" is oddly hushed and muffled, subverting the album's obvious Big Rock Moment into something stranger and more unpredictable. ""Axe & Stump"", with its oblique Afro-pop nods, and the just shy of straightforward ""Wishbone Medallion"" find some intriguing ways to twist themselves in and out of knots, too. Keeping the record further off-kilter, Brosseau scatters several not insignificant instrumental tracks throughout. They range from the wistful (""Boothill"") to the wide-eyed (""Miss Lucy"") to the more abstract (""Youth Decay"" and ""Chandler""), yet even without vocals they impressively adhere to Brosseau's style. Yet were one to still suspect, even for a second, that Brosseau is widening his scope simply in search of wider success, he also offers an explicit reminder of how malleable a talent he remains by starting and finishing the album with the same song, albeit in very different forms. The first version of ""Favorite Color Blue"" is austere and acoustic folk, in the mode of Brosseau's earlier work. The second, however, is full of pulsing synths and further embellishments, not so much a remix as a re-imagining. By book-ending Posthumous Success with these two dissimilar yet equally effective and affecting takes on the same song, Brosseau is keeping us on our toes. Is the latter a tease of a future direction he plans to take, or a sly concession to the stylistic temptations he's thus far largely resisted? ""I'm slowly changing my style,"" he sings. ""I got new shoes and now all I want to do is dance a while."" Time will tell, but listening to Brosseau finding his footing at least makes the mystery more compelling.","The North Dakota troubadour draws from Woody Guthrie's folk wanderlust, Cole Porter's cosmopolitanism, and Jeff Buckley's arty otherworldliness.

Infidel,At War,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b0ea9e61561daa51c9/1:1/w_160/baf6b31f.jpg,2009-08-25 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13381-infidel/,Heavy Artillery,"The best way to learn about thrash metal is, ironically, not through its big names. Most of the ""Big Four"" of thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer) became big by straying from the genre. Metallica started writing radio hits; Megadeth tried to do likewise. Anthrax dabbled in rap, alt-metal, and rock. Only Slayer stayed mostly true to thrash, but they are so sui generis that they are almost their own genre. Thus, the so-called ""second tier""-- bands that never made it big-- comprise thrash's true sound. These bands knock out machine-gun riffs and polka beats with no regard for the mainstream, and are often much more intense than the Big Four. At War are one such band. Even when they began in the 1980s, they stood out from the thrash herd. They were from Virginia, not one of America's thrash epicenters (New York City, Los Angeles, the Bay Area). They also weren't pacifists. Much of 1980s thrash was a reaction to Reagan-era policies, with countless bands preaching the horrors of nuclear war. At War, however, were unabashed military supporters. They weren't necessarily right-wing conservatives; one of their songs advocated the separation of church and state. But they had friends and family in the military, and paid tribute to that history through their music. Thus, military imagery pervaded their artwork, and military sounds peppered their albums. Like most of their thrash colleagues, At War stood down in the 1990s once grunge came along. But popular music is cyclical, and the past few years have seen a resurgence in thrash metal. New bands have sprung up to emulate old ones, many of whom have reunited. Thus, At War's new album Infidel feels both retro and contemporary. The band's straight-ahead approach has not changed. Paul Arnold's vocals remain commanding and rhythmic. Shawn Helsel's guitars still blend MotÃ¶rhead with German thrash. Dave Stone's drums have the surprising subtlety they had in the 1980s. The band even retained old-school thrash producer Alex Perialas for this record. He elicited the band's strongest performances to date. The band has never sounded so tight, nor has it ever had such big production. Such precision and cleanliness is slightly odd for a band known for its rawness. The sound has power, though, and reflects the realities of recording in a more technologically advanced time. War requires an enemy. For At War, that has shifted from Communists to Muslim fundamentalists. The cover of Infidel depicts an eagle-tattooed man facing down an army of Jihadists. ""Want You Dead"" features a chorus of ""They want you dead/ Kuffar die!/ They want you dead/ Open your eyes!"" This is hardly diplomatic, but metal is not diplomatic music.Â Infidel is a strong statement.Â  Agreement with it is up to the listener.","Thrash metal veterans return during their sound's revival with a record that feels both retro and contemporary.

Awe Owe,Helado Negro,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a550ea9e61561daa50e7/1:1/w_160/8040a84d.jpeg,2009-08-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13292-awe-owe/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The concept of black ice cream-- what flavor is ""black"" anyway? licorice? walnut? black bean?-- sounds strange but refreshing. Which is an apt description of the music of Helado Negro, Roberto Carlos Lange's project named for the Spanish translation of that odd dessert. On his debut, Lange, the Florida-raised child of Ecuadorian immigrants, offers a lazy summer's day worth of dreamy, percussive tracks (almost entirely sung in Spanish) that pay homage to his roots yet use broad brush strokes from a silvery, futuristic palette. It's like Beck's version of TropicÃ¡lia, but bled of his white-boy admiration of the exotic. You may recognize Lange from his work in Guillermo Scott Herren's Savath y Savalas, a project that is similarly enamored of Latin American psych-folk, scratchy beats, and warm, homemade production. And, in a lot of ways (most notably its blend of traditional Latin music with the elastic sonics of experimental electronica), Awe Owe sounds like a follow-up to Savath y Savalas' La Llama, which was released earlier this year. Except that there is no place for Llama's spooky undercurrent amidst Awe Owe's feather-weight, beachy effervescence. Without the steely, mechanical effects and dark, tinny din that are clearly preoccupations of Herren's, Lange is free to leave lots of airy space between his chattering percussion and loopy xylophone melodies and play with whispery bossa nova textures without being overwhelmed by rhythmic heaviness. Without hooks to hang on to, though, or vocals to serve as your guide-- most of the singing here is washed out, like the sun-bleached stucco of homes by the shore-- this album gives off a first impression of curiously constructed background music. But like a pointillist painting, the individual songs seem fuzzy and indistinct until you look at the album as a whole, and only then do they sharpen into view. Opener ""Venceremos"" (translation: ""we will triumph"") gives the album a whimsical start, with a plucky xylophone run that's reminiscent of Stephen Malkmus' ""Phantasies"". The track then finds its groove with trotting percussion that sounds like horse hooves against cobblestone streets and an acoustic strum so breezy that you can practically smell the saltwater in the air. With its ambiance so clearly stated from the get-go, the album then moves on into Animal Collective territory with ""Espuma Negra"", which builds its psych-tinged track over a hypnotic, repetitive core riff. Then ""Dos SueÃ±os"" lives up to its title (which translates to ""two dreams"") with an ethereal, winding melody, spare, plinky orchestration, and some tangy harmonized ""oohs"" that are so mellifluous they almost sound created by synthesizers or a Theremin instead of human voices. The album is frontloaded, though, and the middle, mostly instrumental section is somewhat forgettable and monotonous before giving way to the best song on the record. After roughly 35 minutes of organic melodies spackled over electronic beats and effects, closing track ""Deja"" surprises with its handclap percussion, which makes a nice bed for Lange's hushed, easy singing, nimble fingerpicking, and the ominous sound of distant church bells. Eventually the track displays Lange's mechanical proclivities, layering hard-edged scrapes and computerized bubbles under its echo-y vocal melody, making it the only track on the collection that sounds like it is meant to be listened to, not by the sea, but 20,000 leagues under it. Lange made Awe Owe in his home studio in Brooklyn with different friends and collaborators (from the aforementioned Herren to Stars Like Flea's Shannon Fields) floating in and out of the sessions, and this gives the album the feel of being stitched together like a homemade quilt. And like a quilt, it is warm and comforting, if not necessarily dynamic. So while it may never deviate from its mid-tempo lull, its mellow, reflective songs are goosed by their Latin melodies, making it a languidly satisfying complement to the hazy, hot final weeks of summer.","Guillermo Scott Herren collaborator's project is similarly enamored of Latin American psych-folk, scratchy beats, and warm, homemade production.

Cartography,Arve Henriksen,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55db1335d7bf1698ba3/1:1/w_160/a719154d.jpg,2009-08-25 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13379-cartography/,ECM,"Arve Henriksen came at jazz sideways, honing his singular voice as a session player-- with David Sylvian's Nine Horses, Christian WallumrÃ¸d, Supersilent, and many others-- and through a series of fine, ambient-tinged albums for the Rune Grammofon label. These were tricky, seductively spare works that got at jazz by outlining jazz-shaped holes. They were most notable for Henriksen's adventurous, curiously-phrased style as a trumpeter. He made his instrument sound like a woodwind, a flock of birds, a Japanese flute, a punctured helium balloon. His strangled yet fluent tone is marked by a vivacious Scandinavian melancholy and a hint of noir. His meditations for trumpet and electronics expand the warm, alien landscape that Jon Hassell initially revealed, and populate it with Olivier Messiaen's avian familiars. Cartography, Henriksen's first album for the serious-business jazz label ECM, is an ambitious showcase for his exotic syntax: Notes float on cushions of air or clang like lead; they sigh, squeak in distress, bleat, and taper off into thin shrieks. When ravishingly full tones break out from the baroque constraints, the effect is devastating. Henriksen plays the way Ian Curtis sang: A rough-and-ready yet wounded voice, always on the verge of cracking with emotion. On ""Migration"", he unrolls a gaseous theme that periodically dissipates into the merest pinched tones-- minimalism's pervasive mark is not omitted here. The climactic swells of ""Migration"" have chafed edges, as if Henriksen's trumpet had a sore throat. He spits rapidly through the mouthpiece on ""Ouija"" to create a richly-textured, telegraphic stutter. But he's a focused, patient player, who miraculously condenses breathtaking themes from this almost-zoological diversity. Cartography differs from prior albums in that it was cobbled together from structured improv sessions with a variety of collaborators, both live and in-studio, over a three-year span. But it plays seamlessly, owing to Henriksen's highly-developed style, as well as to smart, immersive post-production by Jan Bang and Erik HonorÃ©, who enrich the live instrumentation with samples, field recordings, synthesizers, and programmed beats. While Henriksen's plaintive motifs are still central, pacing the development, there's a lot more going on around them than before. ""Poverty and Its Opposite"" sets Henriksen's trumpet against a distant shimmer and intensifying abstract percussion; it's like a forest coming to life as night falls. ""Recording Angel"", with its scratchy textures, haunting Trio Mediaeval vocal samples, and founts of drenching melody, is a jazz answer to Nico Muhly's Mothertongue. From the distressed orchestral samples on ""Loved One"" to the staticky piano of ""Sorrow and Its Opposite"", the invention never flags, and never veers away from the service of severe beauty. No matter how many times I hear the two pieces that feature spoken-word poetry by David Sylvian, I can never hold onto the narrative thread for very long before I slip into the sounds of the words and the timbre of Sylvain's calming voice. That's how deep an enchantment Henriksen casts on Cartography, which maps an impressionistic world where sound is meaning.","The adventurous trumpet player, best known for his work with Supersilent and his solo records on Rune Grammofon, makes a terrific debut for ECM.

Kid A: Special Collectors Edition,Radiohead,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b313d1975652138fff/1:1/w_160/deebee15.jpg,2009-08-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13385-kid-a-special-collectors-edition/,Capitol,"We used to listen to music in an entirely different way. There was once a time when music was organized into 45- to 75-minute chunks-- often a few standout tracks padded with a lot of mediocre filler, but occasionally designed so that the parts built up a larger structure. Used to be, people would sit down and listen to that lengthy piece of music from front to back in one sitting, resisting the urge to jump to their favorite parts or skip over the instrumental interlude that served as grout between two fuller compositions. These antiques were called CDs. Here's a story about the last of its kind. When Kid A came out in October 2000, it sounded like the future. Unless you were a Napster whiz-kid, the record was one of the last to arrive unspoiled and complete, a physical object, the disquieting Stanley Donwood art reinforcing its dark mystery. It's arguably two-and-a-half minutes into ""How to Disappear Completely""-- more than a third of the way through the album-- until anything sounds like a ""Radiohead Song,"" even with how far the elastic of that term was stretched on OK Computer. And while Radiohead were far from the first to glitch-up their vocals with a computer or drown their compositions in ambient washes, it was still a thrilling experimental gamble for a band that could've profitably re-made ""Karma Police"" 100 times over with minimal reputational damage. But simply flirting with new technology wasn't enough; even in 2000, the idea of a band ""going electronic"" was a laughable marketing gimmick from an era that spawned the term ""electronica."" But the samples, loops, and beats of Kid A were more than just the patronizing dalliance of a bored band, they were tools used to service the album's even deeper exploration of OK Computer's thesis on identity loss in computerized society. It was, unashamedly, a complete album, one where everything from production to arrangements to lyrics to album art were carefully crafted towards a unified purpose. It's also a contoured album without clear highlights, best experienced in one sitting rather than cherrypicking the best parts. (It's telling that the band famously quarreled over the sequencing of tracks.) The biggest stylistic coup was the corruption of Thom Yorke's vocals-- arguably the band's most singular feature up to that point-- and the detuned-radio effects of the album's opening couplet: ""Everything in Its Right Place"" and ""Kid A"" threw listeners expecting that signature ""Fake Plastic Trees"" falsetto immediately into the deep end. On ""The National Anthem"", Yorke is shouted down by horn section mayhem, and when he finally gets in an unfiltered word in on ""How to Disappear Completely"", it's the album's most haunted (and revealing) line: ""That there, that's not me."" There's no storyline to pick out from Yorke's lyrics, but a unified thread moves through the album nonetheless: Basically, Kid A is scary as hell. It might be the paranoid, nearly subliminal, unbroken undercurrent of haunted drone, courtesy of a Rhodes or a tape loop or Jonny Greenwood's Ondes-Martenot, a instrument for nightmares if there ever was one. Or it might be Yorke's terrifying one-line, Chicken Soup for the Agoraphobic Soul mantras that alternate between honeyed violence (""cut the kids in half"") and clichÃ©s and hum-drum observations twisted into panic attacks (""where'd you park the car?""). (A brief intermission to talk about the bonus tracks included with this reissue. Capitol's in a tough spot with finding Kid A outtakes, because they already released such a thing-- it's called Amnesiac...rimshot. So instead the bonus-disc padding is all live tracks, culled from British and French radio or TV shows. In keeping with the album's isolation fixation, the empty studio of the four-track BBC session is the most fitting environment for the band's performance, the vocal manipulations of ""Everything in Its Right Place"" ricocheting off egg-crate walls. Contrast that with the clap-along crowd on an ""Idioteque"" from France, which neuters the song's sinister undercurrent and turns it into an inappropriate party jam.) Every great album needs a great resolution, and Kid A has two: the angelic choir and harps of ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" which serve as a much-needed (if fragile and a bit suspicious) uplift needed after such unrelenting bleakness, and a brief ambient coda that justifies the hidden-track gimmick. The silence that surrounds that final flash of hazy analog hiss is almost as rich, conferring a eerie feeling of weightlessness upon anyone who's completed the journey with a proper headphones listen. But that's where the twist ending comes in. Kid A turned out not be the music of the future, but a relic of the past, more in line with dinosaurs like Dark Side of the Moon or Loveless as try-out-your-new-speakers, listen-with-the-lights-off suites. By the time Amnesiac officially arrived, it had been served up piecemeal on the internet, handicapping the final product from reproducing its predecessor's cohesive structure. From then on, albums have persisted, sure, but they're increasingly marginalized or stripped for parts-- release Kid A today, and many might choose to save or stream ""Idioteque"" and Recycle-Bin the rest, missing the contextual build and release that makes the album's demented-disco centerpiece all the more effective. That's not a qualitative judgment: The way things are now isn't better or worse, just different. Technology, of course, is a selection pressure, digital music eroding the arbitrary 45ish-minute barrier that once was dictated by vinyl's finite diameter. But while a single song will often do, there's a talent to building and a pleasure in experiencing a dozen songs weaved together into a 40 minutes that's richer than each individual track, a 12-course meal for special occasions between microwave snacks. Like calligraphy, it's a fading art, as even Radiohead themselves seem to be disinterested in the format, perpetually threatening to dribble tracks out in ones or fours when the spirit takes them. In the end, one of the many ghosts that haunt the corridors of Kid A is The Album itself, it's death throes an unsettling funeral for a format that, like so much else, was out of time.","Capitol follows its excavation of Radiohead's 1990s work with new version of the band's first three 2000s LPs, including the landmark Kid A.

Conditions,The Temper Trap,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b5ea9e61561daa51d1/1:1/w_160/e661056c.jpg,2009-08-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13368-conditions/,LiberationGlassnote,"The Temper Trap didn't come out of nowhere. But even in an age of instant global communication, Australia is still pretty far away from most of the rest of us. So when this Melbourne rock foursome with stadium-sized ambitions first landed in my inbox last October, it was a modest revelation. Curtis Vodka, Alaska's remixer extraordinaire, was pushing all the right tech-textural buttons on an epic reworking of ""Sweet Disposition"", a majestic anthem which, if annoyingly derivative, had ""mainstream hit"" written all over it. Listeners who Shazam'd the original after hearing it in ads for Sky Sports TV in the UK-- or, stateside, on the trailer and soundtrack to alt-emo romcom (500) Days of Summer-- probably know the feeling. Hemispheric differences may have given the Temper Trap room to develop their radio-friendly sound without getting pushed prematurely into the spotlight (for real: sorry, Black Kids), but otherwise their debut album could've been made just about anywhere. Conditions is one for the Coldplay set-- all tightly executed grandiosity and U2 pedals, generally with [pounding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbE1-ZPz-Cg ""The Doves, ""Pounding"""" ) drums, soaring vocals about steadfastness or mortality or whatever, one rumbling bass note per arpeggiated guitar chord, and a modest drizzling of synths. Unfortunately, when you adopt the trappings of revolutionary significance without showing much interest in advancing beyond the revolutions of 20 years ago, you sound ridiculous. Southern conservatives are super concerned about racial discrimination now, you guys. Defined by almost any measure except musical creativity or lyrical ingenuity, the Temper Trap are a lot better than I'm making them sound. Dougie Mandagi's virtuosic falsetto is the kind of instrument that should come with a money-back Jeff-Buckley-comparison guarantee. When Mandagi comes in, over ecclesiastical keyboard stabs and handclaps on opener ""Love Lost"", there's a brief glimmer of hope Conditions will end up being more like TV on the Radio, with all that New York group's restless adventurousness, than, um, whichever band we gave that ""U.2"" rating. His bandmates are no slouches, either, as instrumental finale ""Drum Song"" shows. If its jagged rhythmic attack owes something to Arctic Monkeys, then it's no coincidence-- producer Jim Abbiss also helmed the brainy Brits' fateful debut, along with albums for Kasabian, Adele, and others. What the Temper Trap do devastatingly well is drape post-office-party mistake-hookup tackiness in the lofty imagery of global struggle. You can just picture Mandagi standing on a mountaintop for ""Sweet Disposition"", his hair blowing in Bono's wind, but remember, ladies: Some insincere sketchball with limited imagination is going to use this to try to get you to have sex with him. ""Just stay there/ 'Cause I'll be coming over,"" Mandagi booms. ""Won't stop to surrender."" Well, love is a battlefield, right? Elsewhere, the Temper Trap's pairing of sweeping portentousness with mundane douchebaggery is trickier to overlook. ""I pledge myself allegiance to a battle not to sleep at home,"" Mandagi clarifies on another single, the reasonably catchy uptempo electro-rocker ""Fader"". Synth-dripping slow jam ""Fools"" adds, ""I want it, I want it, I want it,"" amid rebukes to unnamed, uhh, fools. Cold War Kids-ish indie nod ""Down River"" pulls out all the orchestral, choral, and vaguely baptismal flourishes in Neon Bible's book to repeat, ""Go, don't stop."" And remember ""Love Lost""? It adapts a line from ""Amazing Grace"" into a request to ""flash your heart."" Yeah, open up your shirt and-- ohhh. One more in the name of love: Latest UK single ""Science of Fear"" samples Robert F. Kennedy's famous remarks on the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. I take it Mandagi still hasn't found what he's looking for. It's telling to learn where, in fact, the Temper Trap did come from. The first thing producer Abbiss apparently heard from the band was a demo of ""Soldier On"", Conditions' Muse-rific nadir. Mandagi tells the BBC, ""His wife really liked it so apparently they had a moment together and out of obedience to his wife Jim decided to record us."" The six-minute track moves from Grace-ful guitar and falsetto into gnashing prog-rock bombast, until Mandagi is seriously howling at ""death."" I'm gonna assume he means the little one-- what the French call ""la petite mort.""","Australian band with radio-friendly ambitions follows its ""Sweet Disposition"" single with a record that shoots for the heights of the Arctic Monkeys or U2.

If You Know What's Good for Ya!!,Woolfy,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b79d034d5c69bf336d/1:1/w_160/f3f4bc80.jpg,2009-08-24 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13387-if-you-know-whats-good-for-ya/,DFARong,"Since joining hands with big-brother-in-arms DFA Records, San Francisco-based Rong Music has increasingly co-opted the sly branding of their (recently, perplexingly quiet) partner, re-releasing their Notwave compilation and issuing a collection of !!!-offshoot Free Blood's singles. Electro-popper Woolfy comes in for the theoretically profile-raising comp treatment next, as If You Know What's Good For Ya!! snaps up a handful of the singles they've released since 2005 and pairs them with fresh material. The result is a neat compendium of many of the decade's electronic-pop trends, from digestible funk-punk to spaced-out disco. Lead single ""Oh Missy"" (which appeared as early as 2005 as an A-side, was remixed on a label comp in 2007, and was again released as a 12"" earlier this year, presumably to prep for If You Know) borrows DFA's oldest, and best, trick: Trojan Horse-ing in a great pop number under the guise of a dance track. Slated second here, Woolfy wastes no time introducing listeners to what remains his best song: speedy congos, serrated, upsmacked guitar chords, and, as Woolfy's big-floor vocals drop, thwumping bass. ""I'll tell you what's wrong/ If it makes you see the whole half of it"", he declares with the confidence of man who is actually saying something. As a preening takedown of a rogue babe, ""Oh Missy"" touches on (without getting too wild) late-70s pop-disco Stones. If You Know rarely reaches ""Oh Missy""'s heights again, but there's plenty to like: the quick-finger guitar strut of ""Odyssey"" and the hard-scrabble electro-punk of ""The Warehouse"" (both previously released) retain their sense of craftsmanship and their nervy hooks. ""Looking Glass"" is the obvious breakout candidate among the new tracks, with a big, infectious synth-pop groove and Woolfy's shouty, processed verses leading to a soft, stuttered chorus: ""Don't/ Take/ Your/ Eyes/ Off me."" ""Sonic Monday"" is a drizzly, undeniably British ballad, developing slowly as swaths of digitized noise patter about; it's saccharine and weightless in the way Bernard Sumner's slower moments were. Woolfy's pop instincts remain mostly on point, though the LindstrÃ¸m-lite of ""Loa the Disco"" is undercooked and ""Pink Champagne"" (the final original composition before the remixes) is either drearily heavy-handed or a fitting ""the drugs don't work""-style salve depending on your tolerance for weepy closers. The remixes-- Carlos Hernandez's lounge-y take on ""Two Far Gone"" and Lee Douglas' lightening of ""The Warehouse""-- serve only to move If You Know from a manageable 45 minutes to more than an hour in length. It's fine, though, that If You Know arrives with blemishes; nothing about Woolfy's track record suggested a coherent, workable, full-length was in the cards. If You Know is a bit perplexing-- if we're collecting, why not collect all of the mixes?-- but ultimately a useful tool for putting to bed Woolfy's past while eyeing his future.","DFA partner Rong Music collectsÂ thisÂ electro-pop artist's post-2005 singles and pairs them with fresh material.

Slaughterhouse,Slaughterhouse,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5af13d1975652138ff4/1:1/w_160/eb3c9b0d.jpg,2009-08-24 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13373-slaughterhouse/,E1,"Slaughterhouse are adorable. Clearly, this was not their intent. If you've spent any time in the last two years braving the sort of internet scuttlebutt that makes it feel like talking about rap is a full-time job, you know Slaughterhouse is what the game's been missing in 2009, a hyper-masculine corrective to a hip-hop scene that had grown disgustingly soft. But really, there's something nerdy and cute about the treehouse conspiratorial vibe of four rappers (Crooked I, Joell Ortiz, Royce Da 5'9"", and Joe Budden), united by little more than a history of label politricks and a love of bareknuckle rhyming, joining forces to commit the sort of industry shakedown none could achieve on their own. You gotta wonder if Freddie Foxxx is more pissed than he usually is for not getting a call. But the excitement is understandable-- in case you haven't noticed, everyone's hopping on the idea that there's a 90s revival underway, and in theory, Slaughterhouse provides a missing link to the awe-inspiring posse tracks of the mid-Clinton years-- songs like ""Banned From TV"", ""Verbal Intercourse"", ""John Blaze""-- except that the whole album would be like that! But as anyone who's cheered for a squad GM'd by Isiah Thomas, listened to a Dylan/Dead record, or paid $12 to see He's Just Not That Into You knows damn well, the fantasy approach to franchise-building has a staggering failure rate. The best rap groups are borne of collaboration and chemistry from complementary parts, but Slaughterhouse is less duel of the iron mic and more Pro Bowl talented performers caught up in a listless walk-through with no real competitive incentive and no indication that they spent any time beforehand in the same room planning things out. Granted, each of these guys can bring the pain on whatever track they're on, but that's pretty much the entire problem here-- all four essentially serve the same purpose, blunting each other's effectiveness and magnifying the sort of problems that always arise when a rapper can put together a hot verse but not a decent album. For all of its Jack White ""realness"" shtick, Slaughterhouse still has commercial aspirations but absolutely nothing resembling pop instincts. The only way you could put together a supergroup in 2009 with a worse ear for beats would involve getting Jadakiss, Nas, Foxy Brown, and Marlee Matlin in the booth. Befitting a bunch of guys who've orbited Shady/Aftermath in various degrees, Slaughterhouse's beats are towering, but in a way that's monolithic, charmless, and corporate, like a gleaming office building. Take ""Bad Boy 4 Life""-on-a-budget faux-banger ""The One"", inexplicably the first single. DJ Khalil's geetar-stuffed beat is so intrusive and annoying, you have to wonder why he doesn't change his named to ""Khaled,"" and even if it had a remote shot getting anywhere near a club's playlist, a tone deaf hook from the New Royales throws it out on its ass. ""Not Tonight"" provides the walking music for a whole museum of Hov MC'ers, but only ends up reminding you of mid-decade Roc-A-Fella songs that you'd rather be listening to instead (""Roc Boys"", ""Roc the Mic"", ""Encore"", Freeway's ""Still Got Love""). ""Cuckoo"" takes a stab at pill-poppin', limb-choppin' horrorcore and suggests that they got greedy while ghostwriting for Detox and tried to get a drop on Relapse. There's a song with Fatman Scoop. Seriously. To their credit, ""Sound Off"" and ""Salute"" are the sort of no-frills beatdown rap that would score a 3 Â½ mic rating in The Source circa 1998 and if grokking syllables serves as your sole criteria of an MC's worth, Slaughterhouse is at least impressive on a surface level-- Crooked I puts in the best performance relative to his public stature and if you sprinkle Royce Da 5'9""s verses over a year's worth of feature spots, you might be as excited about Slaughterhouse as you were in 2008. Hell, even Joe Budden acquits himself nicely enough that you almost feel bad that there are versions of this that exist on the web where he's completely eliminated. But SlaughterhouseÂ­'s biggest weakness is what brought us here in the first place-- for a record that's supposed to be so lyrically godbody that aspiring rapsters will retreat to a lifetime of Auto-Tune in fear, the lyrics display no real wit or inspirational spark. Punchlines fail and fail often, whether it's cumbersome comestible raps that recall a very lazy DOOM (""so it bleeds to death like the middle of an unfinished burger,"" ""I want me a sloppy ho whose pussy smells like tilapia""-- thanks for sharing, Joell), delightful homophobia (""like your boyfriend's sodomy hole, full of shit""), or broke man's Wale NBA namedrops that make you wonder how the Knicks could fuck up so bad on and off the court and yet still have Anthony Mason be the last guy who got a dope rhyme in his name (""like Nate Robinson, I back up the point""). If it seems like a show of restraint that they wait three minutes to make their first crack about skinny jeans, I don't know what to say about leaving ""Cut You Loose"" until the 13th track. It's your basic ""you can't fire me 'cause I quit"" missive to a mainstream acceptance they clearly strive for, and the saddest part is when Crooked I goes at Rick Ross and Jim Jones for taking shots at Eminem in 2009-- it takes me back to reading Guitar World in the mid-90s and suffering through technically proficient assholes like Steve Lukather and Billy Setzer putting Billy Corgan on blast for not staying true to rock'n'roll's roots. It's easy enough to dismiss Slaughterhouse as preaching to the choir (albeit one known to be stingy around the collection plate), or just point out that even the most intense internet test-tubing can't save a wack album (see also: Asher Roth), but it's that impotent defensiveness that ultimately makes you think Dr. Dre might've been right about these guys.","Hip-hop supergroup (Crooked I, Joell Ortiz, Royce Da 5'9"", and Joe Budden) is united by little more than shared failures and a love of bareknuckle rhyming.

Landscapes,Ducktails,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ae13d1975652138ff0/1:1/w_160/e015ea04.jpg,2009-08-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13375-landscapes/,Olde English Spelling Bee,"Ducktails is the one-man psychedelic pop project of Matthew Mondanile, guitarist for North Jersey up-and-comers Real Estate and more importantly, a proud son of the mid-1980s. If you happen to have tumblesaulted into the world at about the same time, Mondanile's solo wanderings-- already corralled and categorized by some as tropical lo-fi or a part of the memory-mining hypnagogic pop shift-- should represent a deep rabbit hole. Chances are the first impressive pop sounds you (or I) heard as tots in overalls weren't really those of the Beatles being played/shoved down our throats by Mom or Dad. It was the guitar and synth fantasias that breathed life into our modest television diets: commercials, Saturday morning cartoons, NES, or PBS programming like ""Reading Rainbow"". In a way, those were our first music videos. Mondanile's moniker may seem like just a goof on a Disney cartoon of the same name, but it's also a commitment to conjuring images of ""back then,"" whether you're 25 or 45. Landscapes, his latest full-length, might as well soundtrack home movies of Mondanile's youth. On VHS, of course. That should bring you up to speed on what's happening sonically as well. Lo-fi to the core, Ducktails is a close cousin of Real Estate's sun-dappled basement pop (kind of an oxymoron), Mondanile's Deadhead guitar tones carrying over chord for chord. These, however, are largely instrumental jam sessions of a more monastic stripe. As has been the case with his vinyl and cassette-only releases over the past couple of years, Landscapes' setup is ultra-spare: synths, guitar, drum machine. The success and failure of these songs lies not in the hook department but in how well Mondanile is able to harmonize these textures and squeeze them into a pop context, how he's able to convince a listener to smack their own pleasure centers. Opener ""On the Boardwalk"" is a light synth mist that's very much the tone setter for the rest of the record. With the exception of ""Landrunner"", a hairsprayed guitar jam far more forceful than the rest, everything floats by as if on its own weed-fueled current. That's a double-edged blade for sure, and no matter how ridiculously tuneful Mondanile's loop pedaling gets, things get sticky. While ""Deck Observatory"" is the kind of glass-bottomed bathtub zen its title suggests, ""Welcome Home (I'm Back)"" seems to have had its tempo slowed down past the point of deliriously languid and into yawn territory. But Landscapes is rarely anything but engaging. ""Wishes"" in particular is a slacker standout more harmonically rich, more sweetly and appropriately lonesome than anything else here. And if it weren't for the brittle, frequently jazzy guitar licks that braid together Mondanile's key solo in ""Roses"", you'd be listening to music more fit for a Chinese restaurant or Walgreens. Not a layer goes to waste, though. Just before launching into ""Spring"", a slim guitar jam that could easily have been an outtake from the Terror Twilight recordingÂ sessions, Mondanile mumbles ""it sounds cool like that."" Indeed. It looks cool, too.","Latest album fromÂ the one-man psychedelic pop project of Matthew Mondanile, guitarist for North Jersey up-and-comers Real Estate.

Humbug,Arctic Monkeys,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ac5e6ef95969320b6f/1:1/w_160/72745aba.jpeg,2009-08-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13374-humbug/,Domino,"The hype surrounding Arctic Monkeys' 2006 debut album was so monstrous it threatened to swallow the band and its music whole. And a lesser band might have been swallowed, but it should be clear by now that Arctic Monkeys weren't undone by a little media frenzy. It's no surprise: They're a skilled band that writes complex songs filled with unexpected musical turns, wit, and observational acumen. They have a level of musicianship that hasn't been fashionable since the 70s, but they employ it in a modern way, and everyone I've heard doubt the group changed their mind when I played them one of their records. Humbug, the band's third album, breaks ground in a few directions for the Arctics. It's their loosest record yet by far, following on the heels of the hyperaggressive Favourite Worst Nightmare, which at times was wound so tight it felt like it might collapse from a heart attack on the next chord change. Part of this looseness can be credited to producer Josh Homme, who brings out the darkness that often underlies Alex Turner's songwriting. The guitars in particular have a snapping, reverberant desert/surf tone that fuels the band's descent into night. It's an interesting look for them, and one that undeniably sounds much better on the third or fourth listen than the first. This perhaps reflects that the Arctics, having established and subsequently defended their place in the UK pop firmament, can now afford to make a record that grows on you rather than walloping you in the face repeatedly. First single ""Crying Lightning"" is among the record's loudest, most aggressive tracks. Alex Turner's Yorkshire accent and penchant for detailed writing-- he catalogs the sweets the ""you"" in the song ingests almost obsessively (pick'n'mix, strawberry lace, gobstoppers, and ice cream) and the song rides its overdriven bass line to a theatrical horror guitar build-up. The song's heavy hand is oddly off-putting and engaging at the same time. As an antidote, they'd do well to release ""Cornerstone"" as the follow-up single. The album's highlight, the song is beyond lovelorn, with Turner delivering a swooning, dreamy vocal, possibly his best to date. He makes a somewhat hokey premise-- a guy who keeps approaching women who look like his ex-girlfriend, only to strike out when he asks if he can call them by her name-- actually work through clever turns of phrase and his usual flair with detail. That song feels like a legitimate expansion of the band's songwriting arsenal, but their usual territory offers its share of good stuff as well. Matt Helders' drumming on the frenzied riff-fest ""Dangerous Animals"" is jaw-dropping, and it's one of things that saves the song from its spelled-out vocal hook. ""Potion Approaching"" threatens to turn into a cover of Nirvana's ""Very Ape"" on its opening riff, but the band instead opts for Zeppelin-ish start-stop passages that read like ""Achilles' Last Stand"" recast as a Britpop tune before it shifts completely into a seesawing, mildly psychedelic mid-section. Their riffier tendencies can get the best of them, as on ""Pretty Visitors"", a progged-out song that gets lost in heavy metal thunder, choral vocals (not an actual choir, but the band built up into one), and creepy organ interludes. The balance between songwriting and excess seems to hold across all three of their albums, though, and it's never undone them yet. Humbug isn't better than either of its predecessors, but itÂ expands the group'sÂ range and makes me curious where it might go next. It alsoÂ demonstrates a great deal of staying power for a band that could have imploded before it ever got this far.","The Arctics expand their sound with the help of producer Josh Homme (QOTSA) on this, their relatively relaxed, confident third album.

The Phenomenal Handclap Band,The Phenomenal Handclap Band,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5aaea9e61561daa51ba/1:1/w_160/7c96b490.jpg,2009-08-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13376-the-phenomenal-handclap-band/,Friendly Fire,"You get about 90 seconds' warning before the groove deepens on the Phenomenal Handclap Band's self-titled debut LP. And from there, is it ever on: 65 minutes of slightly spacy live-band psych-disco, Hawkwind jamming with Isaac Hayes with percussion from the Incredible Bongo Band. If that sounds like a party, well, it is a party; you'll want to grab a drink and do your damndest to have a good time.Â To that end, the buzzing, burbling four-on-the-floor dancefloor fillers the PHB-- a cadre of hot New York-area instrumentalists, joined by guests from TV on the Radio and the Dap-Kings, among others-- is a resounding success; a few numbers stand head and shoulders above the rest, but there's a uniform quality to it all, due in no small part to the hydra-headed band's instrumental virtuosity and obvious love of all the sounds they're unabashedly calling their own.Â But this is also a long-playing record that feels awfully long, due in no small part to the band's deft but somewhat diagnostic handling of the music. In other words, party or not,Â nobody's gonna blame you for keeping an eye towards the door. The PHB's sense of reverence for their sources can lend the record a samey quality; sure, there's a few miles between the wormhole groove of ""The Martyr"" and the proggy strut of ""Dim the Lights"", but they're on a similar continuum, with round lines bass underpinning jutting horns or spacey synths or what-have-you. It's hard to point to a track and say ""this sounds precisely like that,"" but there's not been quite enough reconfiguration to result in anything intriguingly new; they're more groove than song most of the time, but boy, do they groove. As such, the parts of the band's verve that can't be drawn back to their record collections are largely the result of a spin through the Rolodex, and these guest turns behind the mic give the PHB its reason for being. Jon Spencer (yeah, that guy!) turns in a characteristically groovy little blooz-swoon for ""Give It a Rest"", and Si*SÃ©'s Carol C croons one out over the steely bump of ""You'll Disappear"" that might've proved a starmaking turn in another decade. Morgan Phalen of the Diamond Nights sounds like he showed up drunk and did his turn in one take, which lends the tune a looseness not often heard on the relatively lockstep LP. Oh, and Lady Tigra's verse, how can we start? Yes, that Lady Tigra-- from legendary hoopty-knock aficianados L'Trimm-- takes ""15 to 20"" for her own, and thank god for it; Tigra waxes funny and mildly paranoid and just a mite ""Rapture""-ous, and for really the only time on the LP that the Phenomenal Handclap Band justify all three words in their name at once. And she's a ringer! And there's your trouble. The many folks who make up the Phenomenal Handclap Band do what they do well, but there's a feeling of anonymity to the band, due to their stable of stand-ins and their workmanlike performances, good as they are at jumbling up a few not-especially-disparate sounds. But the album gets into the most trouble by gleaning a good bit of its personality from outside sources; entirely their intention, I realize, but with the perhaps unintended effect of not leaving one with much impression of what the PHB really are. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the LP for anyone who can't make an hour on the treadmill, but there are a few tunes here worth hearing. Too bad you can't exactly make out who's cranking them out.","New York-area band, joined by guests from TV on the Radio and the Dap-Kings among others, concoctÂ slightly spacy live-band psych-disco.

"Hard Knox or, ""Are You Sure Hank Jr. Done It This Way?"" / Born Bad",Wand,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a5ea9e61561daa4f5a/1:1/w_160/b0d3df20.jpg,2009-08-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13141-hard-knox-or-are-you-sure-hank-jr-done-it-this-way-born-bad/,Ecstatic Peace,"For the better part of this decade, James Jackson Toth-- recording alternately under his given name, as Wooden Wand, as WAND, and with the bands Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice, Wooden Wand & the Sky High Band, and, most recently, the Jescos-- has roosted among those cursed one-to-watch lists. Back when freak-folk was everyone's new hairdo, Toth's meandering sprawls around slivers of songs seemed poised to take the kids who'd memorized Devendra Banhart's Oh Me, Oh My... higher. And of all those grizzled sorts, Toth stood among the most prolific, churning out tapes and CD-Rs and proper albums at a pace so feverish one simply assumed something special would come of it all. Toth got close, too (especially with the almost-excellent Buck Dharma) before crafting more straightforward, song-oriented albums. He slowed his pace, concentrated, and emerged with the Sky High Band's Second Attention in 2006 and the Lee Ranaldo-produced James & the Quiet in 2007. While those records maintained traces of Toth's unhinged Americana, they resigned themselves to transmitting tunes and images directly. After a deal with Nonesuch Records fell through, Toth landed on quasi-major Rykodisc with a sterling supporting cast that included Wilco's Nels Cline and Vetiver's Andy Cabic. Finally, one assumed, Toth was poised to crack the casing that had long made him a second-class songwriter. But that didn't happen: Despite its pristine guitar leads and a handful of stunning soul ballads (""Look in on Me"", in particular), Waiting in Vain met largely lukewarm reviews and audiences still trying to decide if Toth was a freak, a folk, or neither. That's when a bad situation turned into a catastrophe. His band-- including longtime collaborator and wife, Jexie Lynn Toth, or Vanishing Voice-- quit during the middle of a multi-month tour. He persevered, losing his job back home and spending a night in jail. As he's done for most of his career, Toth wrote a lot, though, allegedly churning out 50 songs and submitting 12 of those demos to Rykodisc. Shortly thereafter, he says, he was dropped. No big label deal, no bright horizons: He was just another good songwriter who'd never made it to the big leagues. Those dozen hard-luck demos comprise Born Bad, a limited-edition vinyl release that's more memorable for its circumstances than its songs. Shifting between boozing outlaw country, hard-linining morose ballads, and self-deprecating wry folk, Born Bad is mostly raw nerves and hurt feelings. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but-- from Hank Williams and Chris Bell to Elliott Smith and Will Johnson-- it's just been done better. On the title track, Toth borrows the skeleton of Swans' ""Failure"" and tosses in lifted Dylan nothings-- ""I was dialing in a feral mind transferal salt lick stew-eyed suicide""-- for unequivocal sad-bastard measure. He cries when he reads the paper, curses journalists questioning him, cuts himself compulsivel, does cocaine on baby-changing tables, and generally moans about his crimes against himself and the world. ""I don't believe it'd bother me to die,"" he offers somewhat cheerfully above a Tennessee Two trot on opener ""Agent of Destruction"". Beneath it all, though, Toth keeps a hint of humor (""The Forgiveness Factory) and-- more importantly-- admits that the root of his problems is himself, not the world around him. ""I'm selfish and I'm stubborn but I deal with this every day,"" he sings at one point. He's likely not seeking forgiveness for Born Bad's overwrought emotional folly, but he mostly gains it-- at least from me. On Born Bad's ""Creature of Habit"", Toth moans, ""Sometimes you just need to hear the music from the other side of the room/ Sometimes you just need perspective and a different point of view."" That helps explain why Hard Knox, a collection of 14 tunes recorded by Toth at home in Knoxville between 2002 and 2007, works so well: Freed from the transient aesthetic or emotional whims that ruin Born Bad, Hard Knox simply offers the best of what Toth vows is a sizable archive. All told, it's one of his finest moments to date. Sure, like Toth's career, it's an uneven collection, but-- with its shifting moods and modes of productions-- it keeps the listener close. ""The Drag Pit' is a silly waltz of poignant parables and scenes, while ""Trails"" documents the hardships of the romantic vagrant. Opener ""Arriving"" is stoic and chilling, rife with images of disaffection and crippled despair. Both on ""Lady of Situations"" and ""Saturday Delivery"", he sings softly with Jexie (they're back together, by the way) with wonderful intimacy and quiet, as if the two sat naked in their bedroom, huddled around a microphone as the sun rose. ""Lady of Situations"" is about dying, and ""Saturday Delivery"" is about cheating, but there's an unflagging sweetness behind these closed doors. We're simply lucky enough to have been invited. Earlier this year, Toth signed to Young God Records, the label run by Swans/Angels of Light founder Michael Gira. Young God accidentally served as a crucial foundation for the freak-folk movement by releasing the early and still most essential records of Devendra Banhart and Akron/Family. Gira, by all accounts an iron will with a wide imagination, was an essential influence on those records and in helping both bands find bigger ears. The best moments of Toth's 13-year career-- scattered in general and absent from Born Bad as they may be-- suggest Gira's again found a strong talent who needs the right sort of guidance to make, at last, some great statement. Let's hope this suggestion doesn't damn him: James Jackson Toth remains one to watch.","James Jackson Toth (Wooden Wand) continues to be both prolific and promising, with a recent collection of old home demos and a new LP for Ecstatic Peace.

Snow Blindness Is Crystal Antz,Black Mold,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5abc0084474cd0c0796/1:1/w_160/0faad69f.jpeg,2009-08-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13365-snow-blindness-is-crystal-antz/,Flemish Eye,"Chad VanGaalen is one of those Renaissance people you find scattered through indie rock. He makes records largely on his own, playing a huge array of instruments, and then he does the artwork and the impressive animated videos himself. He made his name with three increasingly excellent albums of glow-in-the-dark, ramshackle indie pop that showcase his odd falsetto and even odder inner world. He's also the author of one of the best modern murder ballads I've heard lately in ""Molten Light"", from last year's Soft Airplane. It's natural for a guy with VanGaalen's skill set to want to branch out, and so we now get Black Mold's Snow Blindness Is Crystal Antz, a collection of 19 mostly short instrumentals that give him a chance to stretch out and experiment. It makes sense to release it under the banner of an alter ego, because it really is a diversion from his output under his own name. His electro-acoustic tracks range from nicely developed pieces that skillfully blend contrasting textures and timbres to inconsequential sketches that feel like dry runs for something he might try in a more interesting song later. On the positive side of that coin, ""Metal Spider Webs"" opens the album by smashing together a little cello and clarinet with a heap of chimes and bubbling synthesizer, while the synth arpeggiations and pulsing static of ""Swimming to Food"" telegraph a sort of lonely sadness. The longest track, ""Wet Ferns"", is a drifting, buzzing song that harks back to a time when people made whole albums of Ondioline music and still thought of the future as a place we were all going to. ""Rotten Walls"" suggests he might try composing new scores for classic arcade games. On the other hand, there are a number of tracks that don't get beyond the idea phase. ""Smoking Rat Shit"" and ""Dr. Snouth"" are sketchy glitch experiments, while ""No Dream Nation"" is full of seemingly random drum hits and doesn't hit its stride until it's mostly over and brings in an eerie synth solo. The less satisfying tracks aren't all a waste, though. For instance, ""Tetra Pack Heads"" is a little too unfocused on its own to invite me back, but it explores some interesting individual moments and sounds I'd like to see him return to. ""Toxic Lake"" is an aggressively noisy percussion extravaganza he could clearly use as a blueprint in the future. Ultimately, Snow Blindness isn't essential listening for anyone but VanGaalen's most dedicated fans, but it is an enjoyable, occasionally even great record. Musicians with eclectic approaches need release valves for their excesses, and this seems to serve that function for VanGaalen. Hopefully, indulging some of his restlessness will help him come back even more focused and hungry on his next full-length under his own name.","Indie rock Renaissance man Chad VanGaalen offers a collection of 19 electronics-heavy instrumentals that allow him to stretch out and experiment.

Ze 30: Ze Records Story 1979-2009,Various Artists,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59bc0084474cd0c076f/1:1/w_160/c6cbfdf9.jpg,2009-08-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13361-ze-30-ze-records-story-1979-2009/,Strut,"An almost-teacher growing up in the Bronx during the 1960s starts making disco records influenced by 30s jazz and Caribbean calypso during the mid-70s. A Harvard dropout and Village Voice theater critic is coerced by her boyfriend, heir to a British maternity-goods empire, to record some music. The suggestion is seconded by a Parisian punk-shop owner then new to New York. The song is called ""Disco Clone"", a brittle dance track by a hot woman about how all the hot women at the clubs look exactly the same, but that shouldn't stop boys from wanting to bed them. It's funny-- it's a disco track, but a disco track that ridicules and defiles the image of disco. Later, the dropout's record is produced by the almost-teacher, who has taken to wearing zoot suits. She calls him an ""ice-cream soda,"" which is supposed to be an insult. Along the way, they're joined by a saxophonist who punches his audience members in the face, and a couple of friends from suburban Detroit who record abstract funk with beat poetry over it. This all happens in the span of about four years, during which Michael Zilkha and Michel Esteban of Ze Records-- and August Darnell, Cristina, James Chance and Was (Not Was)-- change the shape of music around them. Very New York. The records released on Ze at the dawn of the 80s wouldn't have had a comfortable home elsewhere. August Darnell, the almost-teacher (he earned a Master's in English with the intention of joining the vocation, but music intervened), had some success with Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, but wanted more freedom-- freedom he got as Ze's in-house producer and with his new project, Kid Creole and the Coconuts. James Chance and the Contortions made violent, anti-musical rock that people were calling ""no wave,"" but Ze invited him to record disco-- a chance he jumped at, presumably because it would enable him to piss off the fans he had accidentally earned trying to piss people off. Some of the label's singles were fairly straight disco with a flair for theater-- ""Deputy of Love"", for example, by Darnell's friends Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band. Others, like Was (Not Was)'s ""Wheel Me Out,"" were songs only familiar when broken into discrete parts-- a disembodied string melody, the purr of a woman's voice, hippie poetry, UFO sound effects making casual visits, Latin percussion. But together? Unpalatable to everyone-- too glamorous and dance-oriented for the punks to buy, too freakish to ever work consistently at mainstream clubs or at Puerto Rican block parties on the Lower East Side. When it came time for the label to issue a compilation in 1981, they called it Mutant Disco. Listening to Ze 30, compiled by Ze's Michel Esteban and Strut Records' Quinton Scott, you might think that Ze was a pretty good label instead of a great one. You would be misled. It certainly isn't the fault of the misfits who recorded all this fearless, cockeyed music, but Ze 30 is a confused baby. About half the cuts are obvious and half are obscure, raising the question of just who Strut and Ze were aiming at with this thing. After several listens, my guess is two-fold: Long-time fans and first time listeners. Naturally, they hit the woods. Complaints: I don't need to hear Alan Vega of Suicide performing rockabilly. Material and Nona Hendyx's ""Bustin' Out"" definitely belongs here, but the extended version is a waste of space. I'm glad for James Chance's ""Roving Eye""-- ""Contort Yourself"" is, in the realm of 80s art-rock compilations, overrated and overexposed, which is funny considering that most people would probably find it unlistenable. Casino Music's cover of ""The Beat Goes On"" makes me very uncomfortable, which is more a statement of fact than a complaint. Selections for some of the label's biggest artists-- including Cristina, Was (Not Was), and Kid Creole-- feel like second choices, and while the songs are great, their inclusion feels problematic if the compilation really is being marketed as ""the one Ze Records album you need to own."" But with access to a catalog as deep and frequently innovative as Ze's, ""failure"" is an accident of the mouth, a word with no meaning. The selections here do support Ze's reputation. They illustrate, in bullet points, not only what made the label special, but what made them influential to artists like the Chromatics, LCD Soundsystem, even M.I.A. (whose ""Sunshowers"" takes its name and hook from a Dr. Buzzard/August Darnell song). Lizzy Mercier Descloux's ""Hard-Boiled Babe"" is practically dubstep-- so unprecedented that it's hard not to wonder what they were thinking while making it. On nearly every track, rules are broken, boundaries are stretched and pushed back into other territories. (As an aside for people who might buy this but would want to supplement it with other tracks, here are some suggestions: Was (Not Was)'s ""Wheel Me Out""; Cristina's ""Disco Clone""; Lizzy Mercier Descloux's ""Funky Stuff"" or ""Lady O K'pele""; Kid Creole's ""Annie, I'm Not Your Daddy""; Coati Mundi's ""Me No Pop I""-- all songs I'd put on a single-disc compilation of the label, all available through Ze's own digital shop, eMusic, or iTunes.) The current musical moment isn't a particularly great time to reissue this material. There's no particularly great time to be a brave weirdo. Or, it's always a great time. Mutant Disco, unfortunately, is out of print (though available through digital retailers). Ze 30 is a decent substitution, and is accompanied by great notes rife with first-person accounts of the label's history. When Suicide went into the studio with the Cars' Ric Ocasek, Ze co-founder Michael Zilkha hoped they'd record something like Donna Summer's chilly, momentous ""I Feel Love"", a track that re-imagined what disco could do without abandoning it. The duo recorded ""Dream Baby Dream"", an insistent tick-tock of drum machines and glockenspiels offset by the moans of Alan Vega, who does a good impression of someone who has just taken a bad fall. A song by a band that hadn't found a venue they couldn't get kicked out of, sung by a frontman who used to take to the audience swinging a bike chain. A band that, three years earlier, had recorded a ten-minute long exercise in horrific screaming called ""Frankie Teardrop"". And a couple of label heads thought they could squeeze a dance hit out of them.","The adventurous New York label that helped to define the sound of early-1980s left-field dance music celebrates its 30th with a comp.

Wind's Poem,Mount Eerie,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55813d1975652138f19/1:1/w_160/91931243.jpg,2009-08-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13299-winds-poem/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"At this point, some 13 years after those first Microphones cassettes and eight years since the watershed The Glow, Pt. 2, we tend to know what to expect from Phil Elverum. The production will be cavernous and downright primordial, the instruments resounding as though carved from bone and strung with wool. Natural and elemental imagery will abound. And, of course, we'll be treated toÂ Elverum'sÂ unmistakable, unsophisticated, ever wonder-struck mumble. Yet Elverum has a way of playing with those expectations. And, more to the point, knowing what to expect can make us underestimate, which can in turn lead to surprise. If last year's Lost Wisdom outing with Julie Doiron and Fred Squire served to remind us that, stripped of all the scuzz and sonic bramble, Elverum is a damn good songwriter, then Wind's Poem now reminds us that with all his characteristic production dressings in place-- surprise!-- Phil can still be a force of nature. Poem has been touted as Elverum's ""black metal"" album, and Phil has made no secret of his relatively newfound affinity for Xasthur and other lynchpins of the unholy genre. Yet apart from opener ""Wind's Dark Poem"", a slice of bona fide hellfire, any outside influence here feels wholly absorbed into the fabric of what is every bit a Mount Eerie concoction. Even ""Wind's Dark Poem"" retains the singer's characteristic vocal delivery and cadence, and other loud ones-- ""The Hidden Stone"", ""The Mouth of Sky""-- smack as much of the chunky, bowel-rattling heavy riffage of The Glow, Pt. 2's ""I Want to Be Cold"" and ""Samurai Sword"" as anything else. All of which makes Elverum less chameleon and more collector of sounds, assimilating them as he sees fit to suit his grand artistic vision. A vision, as he also told us, that's been there all along: ""I think I've always been drawn to things that sounded massive, or at least created this feeling of an immense vibe."" And massive and immerse are certainly two ways to describe Wind's Poem-- though they hardly tell the whole story. To better do so we might divide the 12 tracks that comprise the record into two rough camps: the loud and thoroughly rattled, noted above, and the renewed and becalmed, chief among them ""Summons"", ""Ancient Questions"", and the epic lullaby ""Through the Trees"", which effectively swallows whole any hell raised by ""Wind's Dark Poem"". The story, then, emerges from the way these songs alternatingly devour or are born from the smoldering ashes of one another, clear skies giving way to ferocious muddle, which in turn begets light and insight anew. The lyrics, appropriately, deal in fundamental dualities. ""My Heart Is Not at Peace"" and ""Summons"" each posit wind as both ""destroyer"" and ""revealer,"" ""Ancient Questions"" pits doubt against a sense of purpose, and closer ""Stone's Ode"" is divided into two distinct movements, one assured and awash in the clarity of day, one less so and detailing the onset (literal and metaphorical, one assumes) of night. What makes Wind's Poem among the most compelling and fully realized Mount Eerie releases to date is the record's ability to satisfy several types of listeners on several contextual levels. The iTunes shuffle junky, for starters, can excerpt almost any selection here and find something to marvel at on its own terms. The Elverum obsessive will waste no time seeking god in the details, the recurring musical and thematic touches, and the intertextual puzzle created across the artist's catalog. Even considering the most basic mechanics of the album format, Poem gets it right: a rock solid opener that draws the listener right in, an effective closer that recapitulates lyrical and musical motifs from across the record, fine pacing, well-balanced dynamics, and the overall sense that one has completed a journey and emerged in a slightly different metaphysical place by the end of those 55 minutes. But then, too, there are the 11-and-a-half-minute second track, the pure pulsating noise cut, and other outliers, as if to remind us that despite any concessions made to the listener-- and Phil has moved well beyond the often formless experiments of the early Microphones releases-- this is still by no means a record to be digested lightly. And thank goodness for that.","Phil Elverum returns with the latest piece in the epic, ongoing existential puzzle he's been constructing for nearly 15 years.

Season Dreaming,Blind Man's Colour,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a505c0084474cd0c0612/1:1/w_160/ed0c6fb7.jpg,2009-08-13 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13225-season-dreaming/,Kanine,"Season Dreaming, the debut from Blind Man's Colour, owes everything to Animal Collective. The record would sound completely different, or perhaps not even exist, without the influence of that band. But rather than accuse Wyss and Chettri of unoriginality or diagram the album's specific reference points-- how the gurgling intro to ""The Warm Currents Pull"" is reminiscent of ""Grass"" from Feels or that the synth build of ""Heavy Cloud Hustle"" recalls the one from MPP's ""Brother Sport""-- it seems more constructive to judge the songs on their own merit. And the tracks that make up Season Dreaming, which are cobbled together with acoustic instrumentation and bedroom electronics and possess the hazy ambience of a long day at the beach, are mostly quite nice. Blind Man's Colour rely heavily on texture and ambience, applying shimmering layers of background synths and dubby aquatics, but wisely keep most of their material tethered to a formal structure. Season Dreaming is the sort of record that could, in the wrong hands, easily drift off into formless bedlam, but the group's employment of simple melodies and tunefulness when needed keeps that from happening. A track like ""Heavy Cloud Hustle"" works because of that balance, its rolling percussion and stabs of heavy bass eventually making way for a lovey-dovey, almost classically doo-wop chorus. Other, simpler songs such as ""The Dinosaur Ride"", with a lo-fi acoustic backing reminiscent of current beach-pop tunesmiths Toro Y Moi and Washed Out, succeed in much the same manner. That's not always the case, though, as Season Dreaming occasionally runs into trouble. The band gets ambitious on ""The Planets Explode"", sort of a noise cloud that floats over flickering keys and ghostly vocals, and loses their footing as the track becomes a bit murky and grey. But that's the exception here and not the rule. Elsewhere Blind Man's Colour show an enthusiasm, like other recent pop collagists Telepathe and Teengirl Fantasy, to incorporate sounds from outside the general sphere of experimental indie, utilizing heavy hip-hop bass on standout ""Jimmy Dove"" and building a distorted synth-pop lullaby with ""Sleeping Habits"". It's these moments of adventurousness that make Season Dreaming more than just a Feels knock-off, even if, yes, it does sound a lot like that album. But to discard it for that reason alone is also to deny the wide impact of a band like Animal Collective and preemptively rule out the many other acts coming down the pipeline also drawing upon them. And believe me, these guys won't be the last.","This Florida psych-pop duo's debut owes just about everything to Animal Collective.

And that's not only because this self-professed ""real geek"" is a redhead who'll take harps over horns. Whereas Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse worked their way through the tabloids while breaking down life's troublesome bits into startlingly candid profundity on record, Welch aims for little but the outer reaches on her debut LP, Lungs. Welch hovers high above her native London's seedy back alleys-- and she's looking skyward. For this glittery free spirit, matters of the heart aren't simple, everyday occurrences-- they're as grand and mysterious as the big bang itself. ""The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out/ You left me in the dark,"" wails Welch on the audaciously huge ""Cosmic Love"". Lungs is a cloud-headed introduction to Welch's world, where It Girl hype, coffins, violence, and ambition combust on impact; it's a platinum-shellacked demo reel drunk on its own hi-fi-ness. Instead of giving this gothically pale 22-year-old with megaphone vox some classy pop-soul to work with Ã  la Duffy or Adele, Lungs takes the smorgasbord approach. Welch bursts mouth-wide over garage rock, epic soul, pint-tipping Britbeat, and-- best of all-- a mystic brand of pop that's part Annie Lennox, Grace Slick, and Joanna Newsom. A lesser talent might fall prey to such veering stylistic change-ups (cough, Kate Nash, cough), but Welch powers through, her ear-snapping alarm call of a voice making Lungs sound like the work of a courageous artist rather than a group of well-paid producers. Of course, well-paid producers are still involved-- specifically, James Ford (Simian Mobile Disco, Arctic Monkeys), Paul Epworth (Bloc Party), and Stephen Mackey (Pulp). Mackey is seemingly responsible for setting-up Welch's rock'n'roll bona fides, chalking up credits for the faux-shock White Stripes rip off ""Kiss With a Fist"" and the swinging and sinister ""Girl With One Eye"", which finds the singer in a gouging mood. Meanwhile, Ford and especially Epworth help their would-be star find a more unique sound that-- more often than not-- is overflowing with twinkling harps and breakup language writ large. Welch catapults off of Epworth's immense tribal drums on two of the record's finest, darkest opuses, ""Cosmic Love"" and the spooky stunner ""Blinding"". Ford's frothy, orchestrated style compliments Welch's theatrical bent on the swelling ""I'm Not Calling You a Liar"" and lilting single ""Dog Days Are Over"". Thanks to Welch's refreshingly immodest talent and vocal abilities, she not only conquers but thrives on the myriad bells and bobs pitched her way by her equally showy producers. ""Seems that I have been held in some dreaming state/ A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake,"" begins Welch on ""Blinding"". The song is about Welch's desire to put her girlish dreams away and face reality, but it conjures a place that's frightfully untouchable all the same. When notions of big-budget music become increasingly rare and name-brand artists are giving fans intimate concerts from their bedrooms via YouTube, Florence Welch's zeal for all things bright and/or shiny comes off as its own act of rebel defiance. Coming to her senses isn't an option.","Unlike fellow quirky UK songstresses La Roux and Little Boots, Florence Welch moves away from the Lily/Amy template by building her career from the bottom up.

"We Gave It All Away, Now We Are Taking It Back",Mungolian Jet Set,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a559ea9e61561daa5104/1:1/w_160/7e98084d.jpg,2009-08-13 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13301-we-gave-it-all-away-now-we-are-taking-it-back/,Smalltown Supersound,"For the past three years, Mungolian Jet Set haven't just been the Balearic disco remixers of the moment, but also consummate performers and storytellers, knowing how to manipulate their audience with an artful slow-reveal of their considerable talents. For a particularly startling run throughout 2007, it seemed like this odd Norwegian duo transformed themselves entirely with each new remix, offering overblown Italo-disco, or beatbox- and accordion-driven electro-gypsy-funk, or dark Jon Hassell-style percussive digital jazz. If they haven't quite been able to sustain this knack for total self-reinvention since, nonetheless the past year and a half has seen PÃ¥l Nyhus and Knut SÃ¦vik continue to cram together just about every sound that can fit in with a slow-mo four by four beat, and a fair few that can't. You'd expect such a maximalist approach to get messy at times, and there are several points on the duo's gargantuan 2xCD remix compilation We Gave It All Away, Now We Are Taking It Back when it does just that, but Mungolian Jet Set nonetheless give the impression of knowing precisely what they are doing. Starting life as a modern jazz group but openly acknowledging the Orb as their current heroes, they balance the controlled chaos of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew with the roaming and ruminative repetition of The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. The duo's debt to the latter record was already a clear-- and perhaps solitary-- thread of consistency throughout the group's work to date, both in sound design and feel, short-circuiting the exotic, the mysterious, and the unashamedly cheesy. Structuring their remix collection-- usually a utilitarian or at best ""mood-setting"" exercise-- as a kind of safari tour at the end of the universe makes the resemblance all-too-obvious, and yet it was the very best thing the duo could have done. With its acres of excess and ceaseless transformations, We Gave It All Away rams home even to the trained listener the essential alienness of this music. If Mungolian Jet Set's only tricks were their polystylistic perversity, their legions of goblin singers and their canny allusions to a million pop reference points (see their stop-start take on Bob Marley's ""Could You Be Loved""), the attraction would quickly pall. Like all maximalists worth a damn, they have the producer's ears and attention to detail of minimalists. They can ""do"" deepness, as revealed on the spacious, acid-flecked tech-house of their own ""Madre (Epics Part 2)"", but even at their most overblown, their rhythms share all the hyper-rhythmic succulence of the most pointillist techno. And as with all maximalist musicians-- certainly the Orb before them-- the future danger for Mungolian Jet Set is that they come to seem like parodies of themselves, still charting celestial bodies but for no particular purpose or goal. Perhaps this set's weakest moment is the still-fine remix of the Shortwave Set's ""Glitches 'N' Bugs"". It's the one moment where they sound content not to challenge themselves, but rather to remain in the subservient position of skillful interior decorators for another artist's vision. It also channels rather too straightforwardly Andrew Weatherall circa 1992. Let's hope it's a momentary lapse, because Mungolian Jet Set are far too good for this fate. Just listen to their take on Ronny & Renzo's ""Big Smack & Flies"": a rolling and roiling masterpiece of tribal percussion and cavernous dub bass. Perhaps the duo's most solemn effort to date, it astounds with its moist density, the layers of drums showering droplets of iridescent sweat as they slap against one another. Here and elsewhere (see their marvelously trancey new remix of Lulu Rouge's ""Melankoli"", too late to make it on here) the groove seems to spiral inwards as well as outwards, plumbing ever greater depths of intertwining, sensuous complexity. For all Mungolian Jet Set's comic allusions, their elaborate costumes and tongue-twisting remix titles, it's here at the very core of things that their singular magic is at its most powerful.","Maximalist dance duo collect its remixes on aÂ gargantuan 2xCD remix compilation that reveals the group's eclectic nature and considerable talents.

I Love You,Amanda Blank,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b8c0084474cd0c055d/1:1/w_160/a9dfa265.jpg,2009-08-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13158-i-love-you/,Downtown,"Ever since Diplo and his larger Hollertronix collective started bringing fairly unvarnished versions of popular urban genres like crunk, Bmore club, and Miami bass to the discerning hipster elite, there's seemingly always been a steady undercurrent of backlash directed at the crew either on the grounds of lazy cultural appropriation or cynically ironic repackaging. To his credit, Diplo's always seemed like a genuine, serious student of his favorite sounds, and the tunes have been almost uniformly hot, so it was easy to accept not only an icon-in-her-own-right like M.I.A. but also a savvy chameleon like Santigold and even, to a degree, expertly crass party-starters like Spank Rock. But, I suppose, a line must be drawn in the sand, and thrusting her crotch in the air obliviously on the wrong side of the divide is Amanda Blank. She's no Maya or Santi for sure, but vitriol against the girl has been especially intense considering that up until now she'd been on only a couple of mixtapes and on one track from Spank Rock's debut. Perhaps some of the extra-forceful disdain is owing to the fact that Blank sort of feels like the last bulwark between some imagined indie community of shared self-awareness and an outright void of crassness. Either she's working too hard to construct a mimetic parody of materialistic fuck-pop, or she's not working hard enough to separate herself from it. Either way, I don't see how you're not better off listening to Lady Gaga, who at least offers pretty good hooks. A few good hooks, in fact, would go a considerable way toward redeeming Blank's largely forgettable debut, I Love You. Remember, Santigold's eponymous bow certainly didn't blaze any trails either, but it was chock full of irresistible, indelible tunes. Not so with Blank, who submits an album that runs a mere 33 minutes and yet still can't manage to outfit it properly, eschewing even the pursuit of catchiness and pop fun in favor of deathly deterministic robo-chants like ""Lemme get some/ You don't want none"" and ""hottest motherfucker on the whole damn block,"" repeated ad nauseum. (Admittedly, ""Big Heavy"" does have a nice Blondie-ish breeze.) The torpor extends to Diplo, Switch, and Blank's other beatminders, who largely recycle well-worn tricks they've ponied up elsewhere, from the skipping vocal samples and dancehall drum fills of ""Something Bigger, Something Better"" to the crunk claps of ""Lemme Get Some"". Only ""DJ"", with its burbling techno groove, really succeeds at wringing something useful from Blank's ""persona,"" evocatively communicating the self-abnegation of loneliness without sounding too much like a Peaches-level lobotomy victim. Of course, it's sandwiched between two tracks that troublingly rely on a beloved 1980s pop classic for much of their juice, Blank's Top Ranking mixtape holdover ""A Love Song"" (interpolating LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"") and I Love You's first single, the pointlessly ""titillating"" ""Might Like You Better"", which cannibalizes Romeo Void's ""Never Say Never"". Keep in mind, to date these are Blank's two best-known songs. Far more apropos is the straight-up cover of Vanity 6's trashy relic, ""Make-Up"", a song penned for the 80s pop tarts by their puppetmaster, Prince. I don't know who's responsible for picking this song for the album, but if it's Blank then I at least ought to tip my cap at her stunningly precise grasp of her own place within the Diploverse.","Lady Gaga minus the tunes, ambition, or sense of purpose.

Total 10,Various Artists,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a4c0084474cd0c0781/1:1/w_160/1cd55d94.jpg,2009-08-13 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13344-total-10/,Kompakt,"Man, 10 years of Kompakt. It doesn't feel like long ago that I first discovered the label-- the way many others did, through its classic Total 3 compilation, which opened my rock-leaning ears to a new strain of dance music that I instantly fell for. Minimal techno! How had I been unaware of this? That was 2001, three years after Wolfgang Voigt founded the Cologne-based imprint, and since then it has, of course, grown substantially in size and cultural import, breaking artists like the Field and Gui Boratto and establishing itself as a one-stop shop for all things minimal via its physical storefront in Cologne and distribution house. But in 2009, one wonders where Kompakt stands artistically. This year, it released a very nice Ada mix, but it's been a few years since the label presented an exciting new artist, and its last truly essential LP was 2007's breakout From Here We Go Sublime by the Field. So, does Kompakt have the juice to go another decade? Total 10, the label's latest collection of exclusive cuts and recent hits, provides a timely opportunity-- an anniversary edition of sorts-- for its makers to address that question. More so than previous installments, which have gradually dipped in quality over recent years (the last great Total comp being the sixth, in 2005) but still remained mostly enjoyable, this year's Total carries with the weight of increased expectations, and even the record sleeve's regal purple and gold coloring seems to suggest legacy, or at the very least continued relevance. So does it deliver? Well, that depends on which portion of the jam-packed, two-and-a-half hour house-and-techno cornucopia you're talking about. Minimal techno lends itself to slow builds, long stretches where the beat repetition becomes a continuous throb, and Kompakt comps generally aren't known for their brevity. But Total 10 is a monster even by those terms, with an average track length of around seven minutes, and the best way to think about it is in two distinct parts-- Discs One and Two, conveniently. The first is easily the better of the pair, and it opens with a bang-- or, well, a serve. DJ Koze, one of the label's more underrated producers, kicks things off with ""40 Love"", a blippy Nintendo-style cut built from live tennis-match sounds (no, seriously)-- a forehand and its return, crowd gasps, and a Monica Seles-like grunt to boot. He uses the crisp pops and dramatic oohs and ahhs as pieces of his arrangement, and what should sound like a gimmick is simply fun and oddly compelling. The rest of disc one, heavier on undulating grooves than we're used to from the label, matches Koze's winner in quality and playfulness. Previous Total collections have separated new and already-released tracks into dedicated discs for each, but this year Kompakt has wisely jumbled the two. It makes for a more balanced overall listen, even if most of the best songs reside on the first CD. Here, you've got Dirk Leyers' fantastic mix of Justus KÃ¶hncke's ""(It's Gonna Be) Alright"", an epic, minimal disco-funk piece replete with chopped-up vocal samples and whiny guitars that annihilates just about everything on the Juan MacLean's similar-sounding LP from earlier this year. There's ""Lovestoned"", a standout track from Ada's Adaptations mixtape, which provides probably the best example of her unique balance of texture, danceability, and smoothed-out sultriness. New jams favor deep-house wallop over glitch and restraint, and thumpers such as Thomas/Mayer's ""Total 9"" and Nicolas Stefan's ""Closer"" explore club-friendly possibilities with zany basslines, insistent snares, and ramped-up BPM. If Total 10's first disc has you convinced of Kompakt's longevity and ability to reinvent itself outside of established microhouse norms, then the second will likely call that into question. It's here where the compilation starts to sag under the weight of its own bulk and relies too much on the type of repurposed tracks that ultimately did in the largely disappointing Kompakt 100 from 2004. Even those of us who pay very close attention to this type of thing almost need a legend to sort out its various tag-team contributors (Mayburg = Michael Mayer and JÃ¶rg Burger; It's a Fine Line = Ivan Smagghe and Tim Paris), and the remixes included don't improve upon their originals in most instances (case in point Thomas Fehlmann's take on the Field's ""The More That I Do""). Add to that a few head scratchers such as JÃ¼rgen Paape's circus-y ""Ofterschwang"" and Pachanga Boys' utterly bizarre Mexican-pop closer ""Fiesta Forever"", and it begins to feel like a decidedly lopsided compilation. But-- and this is a big but-- scattered among Total 10's generally lesser second-disc material are a few really great songs, the kind that save the album from becoming an unnecessary, why-do-I-need-another-Kompakt-comp kind of release. One of those is Matias Aguayo's ""Walter Neff"", which, come to think of it, is also the best track of the whole collection. With the finest hand claps-and-cowbell arrangement I've heard since the last LCD Soundsystem LP, it's ostensibly modern disco, but more than that it's a future-pop number as good or better than anything being done by YACHT, Neon Indian, or any other recent techno-savvy whizkids messing around with dance beats and pop sensibilities. The darn thing sounds so fresh and of-the-moment, and next to a dozen or so other similarly strong cuts here, it makes me think that, yeah, even 10 years in and literally thousands of minimal tracks later, Kompakt's still got plenty of gas left in the tank.","The seminal label celebrates its 10th year with a new Total comp, featuring the Field, Reinhard Voigt, Ada, Gui Boratto, DJ Koze, and Justus KÃ¶hncke.

Arrivals,Worriedaboutsatan,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a65e6ef95969320b5e/1:1/w_160/ae02b351.jpg,2009-08-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13370-arrivals/,Gizeh,"For rockers dipping a toe into the unstable sea of electronic music, the guitar can serve as a sort of emergency floatation device: Helpful to those who haven't given up on notions of the guitar's emotional supremacy, distracting to those who prefer to swim, though they risk sinking. The guitar parts were the least interesting elements of Leeds duo Worriedaboutsatan's first two EPs of IDM-bolstered post-rock, subjugating atmospheric subtleties to prosaic chord progressions. On Arrivals, they abandon the guitar on the shore and paddle out past the breakwater, into a vast and shifting calm. (In reality, they still use guitars, although they are seldom recognizable as such.) It retains post-rock's long stride while jettisoning its typical palette, blending it with a variety of moods-- dub's spaciousness, trip-hop's sullenness, ambient music's austerity, and minimal techno's grid-based pitter-patter, all seamlessly rolled together in alert modulations of intensity. The bass on this album is so distant and ruminative that it seems partially submerged, like the back of an immense sea-creature rhythmically slipping above and below the waves. The percussion is manicured yet spritzy, with the baroque cadences of spitting rain. Periodic vocal samples are hung about in hazy washes, making it sound a bit like Burial for English-Lit majors. The structures are crescendo-based, but arrive by such creeping degrees that we're never jarred, only soothed, lulled. This is consummate mood-music that glints with striking details. There's the high, held tone cycling through the nocturnal drive of ""I Am a Crooked Man"", with its nearly visual wobble. There's the telegraphic progression of ""Pissing About"", a stable axis in a prismatic blur of texture and rhythm. There's the strangulated glitch-melody of ""History Is Made at Night"", seeming always on the verge of breaking into lush glissando. Who needs guitars when you've got string-like themes scudding majestically above rippling sonar blips, scratchy-record percussion giving form to rushing waters and howling winds? The music is so immaculately tasteful that it's hard to figure out how they chose such a silly band name. (It's from a song by the Belgian band dEUS, which makes it no less silly.) But they got the album title right-- they've arrived.","Leeds duo moves away from its IDM-bolstered post-rock to something more compelling, like Burial for English-lit majors.

Silk Flowers,Silk Flowers,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a5b1335d7bf1698c4b/1:1/w_160/ef5975f1.jpg,2009-08-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13369-silk-flowers/,Post Present Medium,"Brooklyn trio Silk Flowers are probably never going to escape the spectre of their influences. Analog-y, downbeat electro-goth has a rap sheet too long. Silk Flowers have the fortune, however, of sounding less like a Xerox of so many legendary bands and more like one of their minor contemporaries: Silk Flowers feels less like the grand statements of Suicide, Cabaret Voltaire, or PiL and more like the quiet, parallel contributions from (to name two reissued examples) Ike Yard or White Noise. It's not an issue of authenticity, because unless Silk Flowers actually live in a meat locker, sleep upside down, and feast exclusively on the discarded ink cartridges of 1980s fax machines, no one lives this life. But Silk Flowers' aggro-skronk machinations sound more legitimately humid and creaking than, say, the buzzed-over SALEM's ""We take drugs, so many drugs even our moms and aunts know""-distensions. Nor is it an issue of fidelity; Silk Flowers' crusted-over instrumentation seems like a choice (Silk Flowers was produced by noted fuzz aficionado Fred Thomas of Saturday Looks Good to Me), sure, but it's one made by the album's instrumentation and atmosphere. Silk Flowers' real talent lies in their ability to carve hummable, head-bobbing moments out of decidedly downtrodden elements.Â  Despite a list of influences eclectic and goth-y, and despite a singer doomed to Ian Curtis and/or Cookie Monster comparisons, Silk Flowers' pop instincts are surprisingly strong. Album opener ""Flash of Light"" pulses warmly, with symphonic synth patches providing soft footing for the singer's noir ranting. ""Costume"" loops a simple vocal-- ""All over their hands""-- over a canned beat and tremulous high end. ""Night Shades"", wordless and giddily propulsive, stirs up a near-pogo-worthy burst of analog synth putty. Silk Flowers also have the good sense to keep their anti-anthems short.Â  You might feel a tinge of self-consciousness listening to the punky, lo-fi bleat of ""Cheap Shot"" or dour whimpering of ""Sand"" (""I felt like I was drowning but no one heard my plea"", rhymed later with, you got it, ""eternity""), but you'll feel a lot less self conscious for three minutes than you would for six or seven. The whole of Silk Flowers clocks in at an almost EP-worthy 27 minutes, with only one track even approaching the five-minute mark. It's a credit to Silk Flowers, then, that they've managed, via brevity and swampy pop moments, to craft a murky, legitimately spooky debut.Â Silk Flowers is modest in both aim and accomplishment, but it never feels forced, gauche, or needlessly retro-fitted.","This charismatic Brooklyn trio sounds less like a Xerox of classic artistsÂ Suicide, Cabaret Voltaire, or PiL and more like one of their minor contemporaries.

Fear of Song,Zak Sally,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a0ea9e61561daa51ac/1:1/w_160/252c46ee.jpg,2009-08-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13364-fear-of-song/,La Mano,"Zak Sally's got plenty of creative outlets: Besides claiming membership in Duluth's Enemymine, he's also an accomplished comic artist on the La Mano Press imprint and can even claim an IMDB page thanks to a cameo in Shopgirl. But I'm guessing that most Pitchfork readers know Sally as the former bassist of Low, which should go a long way towards explaining why such extracurricular interests are understandable, if not damn near necessary-- can't be easy to let loose when you're in a trio that's synonymous with slowcore and whose other two members are married to each other. So, here we have his self-released solo bow, Zak Sally Presents Fear of Song, financed in part by Sally's eBay sales of Low album art. Though Fear of Song doesn't go anywhere near as avant-garde as its title might suggest, it does make me feel like transposing a Jay-Z ad-lib in saying that it's from the real garage, not the ""garage"" garage. Fear of Song is wires-exposed and seams-showing, with an immediacy that pleasantly suggests the lot of it was freshly mastered about five minutes before it got put on disc. In fact, it's worth seeing Fear as what got skimmed from The Great Destroyer on the way to the frighteningly austere Drums and Guns. Fear of Song is almost equally split between waltz-timed but aggressively strummed acoustics and distortion. ""Why We Hide"" recalls Low's ""California"" given a lo-fi makeover with Sally's everydude voice (think Phoenix's Thomas Mars subbing angst for ennui) fighting for air amongst bleating organ and handclaps. The guitars of ""St(r)utter"" shriek with teeth-grinding treble while the mix is defaced with streaks of noise, and on the opposite end, ""How I Did What I Did When I Did It"" humidifies Johnny Marr-styled ringing chords with sticky reverb. The tension peaks in ""My Secret World"", kept stationary by Sally's laconic sneer and a wishlist of lyrics delivered via the urgency of Violent Femmes' ""Add It Up"". But if Fear Of Song is a little misleading in terms of Sally's artistic intentions, the worst you can say about it is that it tips to a sense of self-centeredness that leads to the record's weakest moments-- ""5th of July"" rides a listless post-grunge chord slide into the post-grunge self-pity of ""T.D.T.F."" (""I'll hobble on my fucking crutch""), whose easy rhymes counteract any sort of payoff its cataclysmic blowout of distortion offers. It satisfies musically at an uneven rate, but Sally's a busy guy-- maybe it's just a pit stop on the way to something more fully fleshed, or maybe it's just something that was a weekend's worth of closet cleaning that serves as its own satisfying end. If it's the former, embracing and facing his Fear would well be-advised.","The former Low bassist issues a new recordÂ financed in part by his eBay sales of his ex-band's album art.

Memoirs at the End of the World,The Postmarks,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a75e6ef95969320b61/1:1/w_160/c14cf84f.jpg,2009-08-12 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13355-memoirs-at-the-end-of-the-world/,Unfiltered,"If the Postmarks' delightful, weather-obsessed, self-titled 2007 debut didn't quite catch fire, blame the times. As bands of musicologist types fronted by fetching lady singers go, the Miami trio doesn't quite have the cosmopolitan chic of seductive NYC labelmates Ivy nor London's dance culture-conscious Saint Etienne. Yet they're not nearly as homespun as any number of pleated-skirt, jangly indie pop acts that live or die by the tambourine, either. Up the shamble factor, and they could well be regulars at Indietracks and the NYC, Athens, and New England Popfests, not selling many records but cultivating a cultishly devout international fanbase happily adorned in ""Tim Postmarks"" one-inch buttons. Put on a little more polish, and they might find themselves music-supervisor darlings, routinely opening sold out concert hall tours for, say, Pink Martini. Instead? They're in some kind of listener-demographic limbo, a Venn-diagram sliver between ""professional"" and ""adorable""-- and in today's caste culture, that can spell utter obscurity. The problem isn't lost on the Postmarks, who, rather than dial it down DIY-ward, have ramped it up to the rafters with their second full-length collection of originals, Memoirs at the End of the World. In case the title and cover art didn't clue you in, this is the Postmarks hopped up on some Mancini/Morricone/John Barry axis of cinephilia (something they touched on on last year's cover outing By the Numbers) and embracing all the bold horns, cascading strings, and percussive panache that come with it. Lavish and evocative are the keywords here; there's even a harpsichord effect on ""Go Jetsetter"", a jazz trumpet outro on ""Theme From 'Memoirs'"", and some sitar business on the sumptuously arranged ""All You Ever Wanted"". Several tracks also showcase a hitherto unheard grit: ""Don't Know Till You Try"", with its electronic chirps and dramatic brass, starts out sounding like a lite version of Broadcast's ""Pendulum"", while ""For Better...Or Worse?"" has all the tension of a spy thriller chase sequence, complete with a timpani-accented finale. Some more discerning listeners might rightly accuse the band of studio arsenal overkill, but for the most part Memoirs congeals into a thing of pristine orchestrated pop beauty. There isn't a misstep on here, even if you probably won't hear an out-and-out single either. With the cinematic leanings, it's tempting to position the Postmarks of Memoirs alongside Portishead, and, especially, the later Hooverphonic records, but vocalist Tim Yehezkely is in a decidedly different league. Rather than play the vamp here, Yehezkely sounds like the comely girl staring wistfully out the window on the cover of the first Postmarks disc. This is not a bad thing, and in fact can make for a compelling dialectic, akin to movie star theory's great paradox that stars seem simultaneously ""just like us"" and of another world altogether. Yehezkely, with her limited range and slightly detached delivery, effectively bridges that gap between the music's indulgent/escapist tendencies and our desire to connect with it despite that distance. With her the Postmarks very well may have found a way to speak to both of the indie pop worlds they once seemed so precariously caught between: an unlikely marriage of craft and unpracticed charm, and a music made for dreamers and by dreamers. Can't wait for the sequel.","After a delightful debut and a covers album, the Postmarks ramp up their sound on this collection ofÂ Mancini/Morricone/John Barry-literate indie pop.

Watch Me Fall,Jay Reatard,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a9c0084474cd0c078f/1:1/w_160/91174fa8.jpg,2009-08-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13371-watch-me-fall/,Matador,"Growing up is always a bitch, but maybe more so for a musician who grew up playing punk rock. There's still no right or easy way to mature-- do you stick with what works, playing the music that brought you all your fans, but never getting out from under those initial successes? Or do you slow down, stretch out, and risk sounding nothing like yourself, growing away from the sound that brought in your fans in the first place? This is a conundrum Jay Reatard's facing now, but it isn't the only one: After a successful run of singles on Matador that was compiled last year, Watch Me Fall is the first official full-length since being signed to the label. You can't blame the guy for feeling some pressure, and from the title to the lyrics and even its brooding cover, it's safe to say he might be. That doesn't mean he hasn't risen to the challenge, however. Opening track and leadoff single ""It Ain't Gonna Save Me"" is ample proof that Jay Reatard can mature without the dull connotation the word carries, being as relentlessly catchy as it is careful in its arrangement. His seemingly tossed-off, self-hating lyrics may be even more potent over the irrepressibly cheery jangle of the track, especially in its brief, unexpected bridge. The track sets a tall bar for the record, but ""Before I Was Caught"" comes close, with more tortured lyrics and windmill guitar chords. However, Reatard's factory-like sewing together of hooks begins to overwhelm ""Man of Steel"", with an urgent ascending melody that leads to an uncertain breakdown that could belong to another song entirely. No doubt that Jay Reatard is a song machine, but some of the earlier album tracks sound assembled from parts lying around. While the record peaks early, the rest of Watch Me Fall has a welcome diversity in melody and arrangements, and several late-album growers worth returning to-- the kind of thing that makes this an album, and not a singles compilation. ""Faking It"" gets plenty of mileage out of rapid, clean strumming and a fake British accent, then leads into a re-recorded version of ""I'm Watching You"", which made an appearance on last year's singles compilation, fleshing out its rough charm with warmer organ and putting Reatard's sweetened vocal up front. And he digs even deeper into New Zealand pop with the delirious ""Wounded"", cruising by entirely on acoustic guitars and the surprising flexibility of his voice: disarming falsetto, nasal demands, and impatient bark. A lyric from ""Rotten Mind"" is where the album gets its title, and where Reatard sings paranoid fantasies in a near-whine in its verses, but is tempered by more of Reatard's falsetto and a rapid drum part that sounds like sneakers in a washing machine. The introversion of ""Nothing Now"" skirts indulgence through its buoyant Beatles-esque march before each verse returns. The last few tracks are the largest stretches for Reatard, leaving his screaming young self behind almost entirely: ""My Reality"" builds from more acoustic strumming, but has a sparse, echoing riff winding through it, and leads to a floating, disembodied chorus. ""Hang Them All"" ends on walls of harmony and a violin-laden outro in waltz time, while ""There Is No Sun"" has a gentle, natural flow, disturbed only by a hint of feedback in its final moments. Watch Me Fall is neither a reinvention nor a holding pattern for Reatard-- walking the line between them is tricky, but he continues to make doing so look easy. From his many earlier, artier side projects, to his recent fascination with Kiwi pop, to impromptu covers of tracks like Deerhunter's ""Fluorescent Gray"", listeners are often discovering music along with Reatard, watching him learn and adapt as he goes-- he's in step with listeners rather than one step ahead, and that makes already wildly accessible tunes even more approachable. Self-exploration may carry a little more pressure with it for Jay Reatard these days, but that joy of discovery-- plus the tunes, of course-- is what will keep listeners tuning in, whether he's freaking out over success or getting ready to conquer the world.","After two singles comps, the Memphis punk makes his Matador studio LP debut and continues to embrace infectious Kiwi pop as well as 60s garage rock.

Destination Tokyo,Nisennenmondai,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59e9d034d5c69bf333a/1:1/w_160/eb040dcb.jpg,2009-08-11 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13367-destination-tokyo/,Smalltown Supersound,"For Neji/Tori, their 2008 introduction to America, Tokyo's Nisennenmondai wore their influences on their track list. With songs named after the Pop Group, Sonic Youth, and This Heat, and cuts that careened from freak-out to free jazz, Neji/Tori was an explicit homage to the band's points of origin. This five-song EP, Destination Tokyo, is about where those influences may take them. Detailed and more cleanly recorded, it's as if the trio are demanding listeners move past the confrontations and comforts of post-punk talking points and pay more attention the songs. Not coincidentally, there's more here to pay attention to. Nisennenmondai's hammer blows have been replaced with pin pricks, and each song is more lithe than lumbering. Opening track ""Souzousuru Neji"" sets the tone for the record: Krautrock's industrialized repetition, swatches of melody played against flutters of strangled feedback. Drummer Sayaka Himeno's hi-hat is one of the only variable elements here, loosening and tightening to suggest an imminent Neji/Tori-style eruption. Of course that never happens, no matter how many French Connection-style chase scenes Destination Tokyo evokes. Nisennenmondai maintain grooves until they reach a sort of anxious frenzy, then move to the next buildup. For all the repetitious melodies and rhythms that form the core of the record, they don't sacrifice subtlety or surprise. They drop a barely audible bass hook into the tail end of the joyously frantic ""Disco"", which, whether you hear it the first time around or not, throws the perfectly balanced piece just slightly off kilter. ""Mirrorball"" is the record's greatest departure, a densely woven braid of guitar squeals and taps that seems to gain mass with every measure. Maybe not all the outside references are gone: ""Mirrorball"" especially seems to reference Battles' minimalist, churning grooves, or even Terry Riley's ""A Rainbow in Curved Air"". They even preview ""Mirrorball"" with a sped-up a cappella version of the song (""Miraabouru""), full of rhythm-keeping stomps and giggles. Part of me hopes this is how they always demo their tracks. Since Destination Toyko is the result of a single take in the studio, that may be close to the truth. But Nisennenmondai never break their songs up with the same off-kilter melodies or squeaky vocal hooks, even if that's how the songs start out. It shows an amazing amount of patience and faith in their listeners. Last album around I thought their cloudier, dirty tracks played better than their cleaner ones. I was still more impressed with the physicality of their songs, their musicianship, rather than the songs themselves (the Marnie Stern syndrome, I think). While they're still nimble musicians, Destination Toyko paints the trio as equally exciting songwriters.","On this Smalltown Supersound EP, Tokyo'sÂ NisennenmondaiÂ move past post-punk talking points and pay more attention to their songs.

It goes back to UK garage, which goes back to drum'n'bass, which goes back to house, techno, hip hop, and reggae. A DJ can play four-on-the-floor kicks, thudding half-speed beats, double-time breakbeats, Southern hip-hop 808 beats, dubby bass lines, heavy metal-ish distorted synths, Detroit techno chord stabs, and blissed-out atmospheric washes, and it can all be considered dubstep. Critics love this. Ergo, acres of blog posts and lifetimes of DJ mixes waxing academic about dubstep's sub-sub-strains. Writing and music and dancing and architecture have never been more conflated. For all the talk of dubstep as future music, it is stubbornly recombinant. Dubstep is filled with drum'n'bass sounds from the last decade. Burial, dubstep's big crossover success, was/is essentially house producer Todd Edwards through a druggy haze. Many tout Clubroot, a UK producer, as the next Burial. This is true in that his debut album is not a bunch of disposable DJ singles, but rather a coherent statement suited for home listening. But it's false in that Clubroot sounds quite different. Unlike Burial, he uses vocals sparingly. When he does, they are textures and hardly recognizable as vocals. This goes about things the hard way-- people (especially critics) love vocals-- but it goes further. A sad song feels sadder if it doesn't tell you that it's sad. This album is not future music. It is one of the saddest things you'll ever hear. Its tears come now, not later. This album has actually been made before. In 2003, English breaks producer Tipper released an album called Surrounded. It set cavernous bass and desolate textures atop low-impact hip hop beats. This sound was once called trip-hop; Massive Attack's 100th Window was comparable in its digital isolation. Clubroot's album is similar, though it has traits that will date it as a product of 2009 -- some gently swung garage here, some half-time dubstep there. Like much of dubstep, this record makes for a fun game of ""spot the influence."" The spacey atmospherics of ""Birth Interlude"" harken back to the heyday of LTJ Bukem's Good Looking Records. The bleary dystopia of ""Nexus"" recalls neurofunk drum'n'bass like Hidden Agenda and Ed Rush & Optical. ""Lucid Dream"" and ""Sempiternal"" feature languid drum'n'bass two-step beats and hoover bass lines. But for all its influences, this record is remarkably singular. Its sounds coalesce into a feeling for which words would do injustice. Perhaps it's fatigue; after drum'n'bass' aggression has spent itself, it rolls back its frequencies and rumbles quietly and alone. Perhaps it's wistfulness; all these fog horns and bird calls and musty washes are memories from dancefloors past. Perhaps it's loneliness; after a lifetime of information processing, which in today's Internet age can take but months, one yearns to go outside and meet a fellow soul.","The next big dubstep album comes not from the big-name 12"" producers around, but this veteran producer with roots in drum'n'bass.

Creaturesque,Throw Me the Statue,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a113d1975652138fd2/1:1/w_160/179e2715.jpg,2009-08-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13353-creaturesque/,Secretly Canadian,"Shucks. I've been expecting a lot from Throw Me the Statue after Moonbeams, their springy, surprisingly durable 2007 debut, and now I hope I haven't just been waiting for a star to fall. ""Lolita"" and ""About to Walk"" were killer indie pop singles, and ""Your Girlfriend's Car"" and the title track and a few others held up pretty damn well. I didn't get what I was looking for in this year's Purpleface EP, a bland collection of warmed-over slow burners and leftovers, and I'm sorry to say I can't find it here in Creaturesque, their sophomore set. It's a record that still finds the band struggling to shake a few influences while picking up a few familiar moves from others. Some apparently come shackled to perennial indie pop producer Phil Ek, who does little here to flatter the band's sound, but the band's biggest problem is their own; one of confidence. In all the best senses of the phrase, Throw Me the Statue are an easy-listening band; they play mostly mid-tempo, guitar-led pop rock, peppered with inventive but never perplexing turns and flourishes. Scott Reitherman's honeyed lead vocals are occasionally a bit meek, but for a band who called their first album Moonbeams, that's usually fine. The trouble is, when the song's not there or Reitherman doesn't feel up to it, you get a little closer to the lite-rock connotation of easy listening: the kind of thing you don't have to turn down if your phone rings or some fool steps to your desk. Unobtrusive, they call this. And a lot of Creaturesque is kind of unobtrusive. There's not a song among Creaturesque's dozen to match the best from Moonbeams, and as with its predecessor's lesser numbers, Creaturesque can sometimes float by in a haze of Reitherman's lovely but polite vocals and hushed strumming with not enough melody to go around. It starts out strong, with the bouncy builder ""Waving at the Shore"", but once there moves into ""Pistols"", which takes cues for its floppy melody from several other TMTS tunes (""That's How You Win"", ""Ship"") without offering up too much of its own. Then there's ""Tag"", which finds the hand of Phil Ek sitting firmly on Reitherman's shoulder; the tune's like a more dour take on the Shins' ""Mine's Not a High Horse"", from the Ek-produced Chutes Too Narrow, right down to the hurricane strum and Reitherman's every-which-way vocal. Even ""Waving"" shows a bit of Shin, too, in its melismatic Mercerian climax. Friends of Phil Built to Spill rear their gnarly beards, too; there's a very Martschy guitar turnaround on closer ""The Outer Folds"", and highlight ""Hi-Fi Goon"" nevertheless lifts everything but the sizzle of Built to Spill's ""Center of the Universe"" almost outright. Though he's produced some of my favorite records, Ek's hardly my favorite producer; he'd muffle Van Morrison if he thought he could sneak another effing guitar into a mix, and he tends not to add much to band's pre-Ek sonic palette but a few new, occasionally too-bright tones. And he certainly doesn't do as much for Throw Me the Statue as Reitherman himself and co-producer/multi-instrumentalist Casey Foubert did on the luminous Moonbeams; Reitherman, mild on the mic as it is, often gets squashed here, and the album feels pasty and sags a bit under the adornment. They do get a few more than right on Creaturesque, ""Dizzy From the Fall"" especially; light and airy in tone, gossamer in its intersecting melodies, it doesn't quite have the hooks the Moonbeams highlights did, but bet you'll be clapping right along by the time the horns kick in anyhow. ""Dizzy"" kicks off a nice little mid-LP run that goes through ""Cannibal Rays"" and the aforementioned audiophile-baiting lazer beamer ""Hi-Fi Goon"". The stripped-down, almost tossed-off sounding ""Baby, You're Bored"" is a nice break from all the slightly overdone stuff that precedes it, and though the dull ""Shade for a Shadow"" is no great shakes, closer ""The Outer Folds"" has a mildly anthemic chorus melody that brings things down smoothly. Some of Creaturesque's failure to connect springs from Reitherman's lyrics, which ache for poetry but often come off as a series of clipped phrases, like they're a little afraid to come out and say just what they mean. His more than occasional inscrutability's a bad match with Ek's windpipe crosshairs, and even when he's saying some things they often fade into the frequently mushy mix. As a lyricist, Reitherman's too abstract to be affecting, and it's hard to imagine anyone loving these songs when-- through the casual lyrics, Reitherman's frequently disconnected voice, or the cloudy production-- they hold you at arm's length. Similarly, the arrangements are occasionally familiar and rarely all that interesting: I much prefer the warm, clear vibraphone of ""Lolita"" and harpsichord of ""Your Girlfriend's Car"" to the mushy, nearly all guitar-or-synth-or-both-led stuff here. But it's the song structures that have suffered the most; the bright, bouncy first half and the more plaintive, searching second half of Moonbeams had a ton of nice turnarounds and little moments of pleasure-center pounding, but the songs here don't hop around enough, and when they do, it's often someplace soft and safe. Creaturesque is an easy enough listen with a few moments that stand at attention, but even the best bits can't compare to Moonbeams', and the lesser stuff's far lesser indeed.","After a promising start, TMTS areÂ still struggling to shake a few influences while picking up a few familiar moves from others.

"Live at the Folklore Center, NYC - March 6th, 1967",Tim Buckley,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55eb1335d7bf1698ba6/1:1/w_160/6fe3211e.jpg,2009-08-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13304-live-at-the-folklore-center-nyc-march-6th-1967/,Tompkins Square,"Tim Buckley was only 20 years old when he took a chair in Israel ""Izzy"" Young's shop and played a show for the small crowd seated on the floor among the racks of periodicals, books, LPs, and instruments hanging on the walls. This was the Folklore Center, recently relocated from MacDougal Street to Sixth Avenue, as if physically representing the gradual dispersal of the Greenwich Village folk scene. In 1967, Buckley was not a household name (nor would he ever be); he had released a mannered debut on Asylum the year before, and had a follow-up scheduled for a few months later. At that point, he was a young artist still developing his sound and style, still honing his lyrical and vocal gifts. Although he had spent a few years in New York City before returning to Los Angeles, Buckley was closely associated with the West Coast scene, which was the reason Young booked him: ""I'm presenting concerts again so I can hear what a West Coast singer sounds like in person,"" writes Young in the liner notes to the new Live at the Folklore Center, NYC â March 6, 1967. Buckley must have been a novelty on the monthlong Folklore Center Continuing Folk Festival, the odd man out among New York natives Jack Elliott, Art Rosenbaum, and Spider John Koerner. But he was no more a Laurel Canyon strummer than he was a Village folkie and in fact adopted the brittle composure of the British folk at its stiffest on his debut. There are traces of that formality on Live at the Folklore Center, but it is usually obscured by the influence of Bob Dylan, Fred Neil, and other East Coast singers, which is more obvious on this record than on any of his studio LPs. These are stark recordings of skeletal songs, featuring just Buckley's bell-like voice and emphatic, often percussive guitar playing. The sound quality is good, which is unexpected considering the performance was recorded through one mic on a machine used for taping field recordings. On opener ""Song for Jainie"", ""Wings"", and especially ""Aren't You the Girl"", Buckley conveys the conflicts and romantic recriminations as strongly and surely by himself as he did with a full band and string section on his debut, and ""No Man Can Find the War"" flourishes in this context, the strident strumming and descending melody on the chorus sounding like damning judgments. Live at the Folklore Center is a document of the artist pulling away not just from the New York scene or the West Coast scene, but from every scene. With each record, Buckley put an increasingly distinctive stamp on his songs, saturating them in jazz, raga, psychedelia, rock, and even schmaltz (ever heard his cover of Tom Waits' ""Martha""?). ""Phantasmagoria in Two"" and ""Carnival Song"" point in that direction, even if they feel a bit unformed at this point. On the other hand, his relatively conservative reading of Fred Neil's ""Dolphins"" sounds much less affected than the version that would appear on 1973's Sefronia. What makes this recording more than a milemarker in an unpredictable and truncated career is the tracklist itself: Of the 16 songs Buckley played that night, six have never been officially released in any format, live or otherwise, until now. That the show ends with four such discoveries gives a sense forty years later of the artist embarking into the unknown, starting with the juxtaposition of his delicate vocal melody against his spidery, almost sinister guitar playing on ""Cripples Cry"". ""If the Rain Comes"" never pours, but ""Country Boy"" is a strong stab at country folk, and Buckley sounds like three or four different singers trading off vocals on ""I Can't Leave You Loving Me"". It's a climactic performance that shows both what Buckley had been and what he would become.","Recorded when he was just 20, this CD finds the L.A. singer invading the NYC folk scene and exploringÂ jazz, raga, psychedelia, rock, and even schmaltz.

Solo Electric Bass 1,Squarepusher,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59aea9e61561daa5199/1:1/w_160/2daf350c.jpg,2009-08-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13363-solo-electric-bass-1/,Warp,"Getting called a virtuoso or mad scientist comes with some heavy baggage for a musician, so it says a lot about Tom Jenkinson, who records as Squarepusher, that he's been repeatedly labeled as both. Getting tagged with these contradictory stereotypes-- a classically trained workhorse mastering the canon versus an improvisational, intemperate tinkerer dismantling the rules-- goes a long way toward describing the Warp mainstay's musical output. He can sound technically brilliant and wickedly provocative at times, whether it's with restless, distended breakbeat patterns, buoyant bass-heavy fusion excursions, or airy combinations of these and other styles. And on his new album, in a gesture that could be a challenge in both senses of the word, he merely plugs in his bass and lets his playing speak for itself. And bass, unaltered and without digital delay or effects, it definitely all you'll hear, whether it's delicate melodic progressions, arpeggiated chords or spitfire runs up the fretboard. While Jenkinson's skillful playing, the vital pulse of tracks like ""Cooper's World"" from Hard Normal Daddy or ""Circlewave 2"" from Hello Everything, has earned serious plaudits and a shout-out from Flea, it may be slightly surprisingly to hear how classically oriented some of the songs on Solo Electric Bass 1 are. Granted, he claims to have taught himself classical guitar at age 10, but the elegant, breakneck playing on tracks like ""S.E.B. 6"" resembles that of a Spanish guitarist, and ""S.E.B. 5"" is a rubbery, staccato splatter of notes that belies the thickness of bass strings. Hyperactive ""S.E.B. 8"" showcases Jenkinson's antsy side, bouncing between slap-happy antics and more slow and soulful passages. As the naming convention and out-of-order tracks suggest, the songs blend into each other. It creates an album weighed toward showcasing masterful execution that leaves a pretty muted general impression. Unless you're predisposed toward technical prowess and solo bass recordings, it's probably going to come off as more of a clinic than a collection of great songs. In a 2006 XLR8R interview with Pitchfork contributor Mark Pytlik, Jenkinson spoke of avoiding the ""music for musicians"" tag. A limited-edition solo bass album recorded live at a Paris theater-- just one musician, one amp, and a six-string-- might appear pretty musician-friendly, leaning heavily toward virtuosic self-satisfaction. A large part of Jenkinson's fanbase isn't going to rush out to purchase uncut and unfiltered bass noodling, unless they were hoping for some intriguing digital manipulation or that the Loveless-esque cover was meant as a strong visual clue. But don't start with the simplistic slap bass/""Seinfeld"" theme jokes without considering what these tracks say about Jenkinson's process and procedure. There's a reason the audience gets enthusiastic during this 12-song set. Jenkinson is technically one hell of a bass player. Perhaps by playing it straight, he's playing with people's definitions of what does and doesn't constitute musical skill in a digital world or merely showing off his own ridiculous abilities. For an artist known for restlessness and provocations, this may be a ""mature"" way to fuck with expectations.","Tom Jenkinson returns to his ""classic"" sound, albeit with a twist-- this is a live, solo performance recorded in Paris.

Pop Psychology,Dan Bryk,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a599ea9e61561daa5196/1:1/w_160/79ec2fa6.jpg,2009-08-10 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13357-pop-psychology/,Urban Myth,"A self-deprecating Canadian-born singer/songwriter, Dan Bryk is like Rumpelstiltskin in reverse, unweaving gold nuggets into homely straw. A post on his old website detailing the press for his U.S. debut, Lovers Leap, included an A-minus from Robert Christgau, who called the songs ""gemlike acts of idiosyncratic genius,"" which most musicians would count as an unmitigated triumph. Bryk titled the post ""SURE, THE CRITICS LOVE LOVERS LEAP, BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY BUY RECORDS, DO THEY?"" He closed with one of his characteristic zingers, which always cut both ways: ""The one thing all the critics seem to agree on: Dan Bryk is Fat!"" You can't blame the press for keying in on Bryk's weight, though. When he lived in North Carolina, between leaving Canada and settling in New York, he ran a studio called Flabby Road. And Lovers Leap included a great track called ""BBW (Chunky Girl)"", perhaps the only genuinely sweet song about overweight women ever recorded. This was no condescending shtick; it was about empathy-- ""When I'm afraid for my health/ Mom says I'm slowly killing myself/ My love holds tight, she won't say no/ And tells my mom just where to go."" While it has a relaxed indie tinge, Bryk's crunchy, gleaming pop-rock is sturdily classic, and his body image seemed to differentiate him from similar singer/songwriters. In fact, it was just a facet of what really makes him unique-- he sings about what he is, not what he'd like to be. You can't blame Bryk for being skeptical about the industry, either. Lovers Leap disappeared into a black hole of poor promotion and distribution; now after years of immigration and label woes, he's self-releasing Pop Psychology. It's permeated by Bryk's disillusionment over toiling in obscurity while many (arguably lesser) musicians rise and fall. All the stuff that's usually passive context-- industry execs, recession-era label travails, and hype cycles-- becomes besieged subject. It doesn't rankle because Bryk's just as hard on himself. On ""Treat of the Week"", a piano ballad with a drunken rock chorus, he aims his invective at 15-minute famers but doesn't imply that he's better than them-- he just wants his 15 minutes, too. On the upbeat ""Discount Store"", he gripes about the A&R lady having central air while he shops secondhand. All of the bitterly inspired inside-baseball makes Bryk a Clipse for Burt Bacharach fans, peddling witty cynicism like crack. Pop Psychology adds up to an acerbic but ultimately forgiving snapshot of the mercurial musical world Bryk inhabits; the DJs ""spinning algorithms,"" the singer/songwriters wilting under coffeehouse spotlights, the ravening indie-rock stream teams. This stuff would be merely interesting if Bryk's songs of failure weren't offset by his prodigious talent. His voice is creamy, with a complaining honk that perfectly suits his subject matter, and his falsetto is human yet pure. He channels his classic-pop acumen through a lively variety of arrangements: Coasting piano, cresting electric guitar, and humming brass on ""The Next Best Thing""; piano and distorted lap-steel on ""Apologia""; live-studio experiments in stacked vocal harmonies and split-channel guitar leads. And the industry stuff is broadly relatable, because it's all about trying to achieve something when the universe itself seems against you. (The most telling line on the album: ""Horizons in my way."") In his unromanticized candor-- about his pettiness, his weight, his jealousy, his mean streak-- Bryk takes on the mantle of the public loser, a martyr for all of us private ones desperate to seem better, cooler, and more successful than we are.","Canadian singer-songwriter offers a self-deprecating look at navigating the crumbling music industry.

"My Old, Familiar Friend",Brendan Benson,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5985e6ef95969320b38/1:1/w_160/8ebfbdec.jpg,2009-08-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13362-my-old-familiar-friend/,ATO,"Jack White didn't rescue Brendan Benson from obscurity so much as recast him into a different kind of obscurity. Admittedly, many more folks have seen and heard Benson in the Raconteurs than have encountered him as a solo artist, but (literally) standing in the shadow of Jack White, even when you share vocal and songwriting duties, imposes a different sort of shroud than the fog of anonymity. In many ways, then, Benson's fourth solo album, My Old, Familiar Friend, offers a third start to a stuttering career hindered by label woes, radio indifference, and the kinds of hurdles generally not faced by, say, Jack White. With the Raconteurs having laid the groundwork, Benson finally gets his shot in the spotlight. But to say he's seized the opportunity would imply Benson's gifts were not apparent from the start. However, one big difference is that this time out people actually know who Benson is, and, perhaps taking that into consideration, Benson's shelled out for top-notch production from Gil Norton that greatly benefits his otherwise mostly pro forma power-pop. It's a smart move, since unlike so many in that long line of similarly minded peers, Benson doesn't skimp on the power. Yes, the usual AM radio suspects are floating in the mix-- Cheap Trick, the Raspberries, Todd Rundgren, Badfinger, even Wings-- as well as the acts those bands borrowed from, but Benson emphasizes the raw power of his riffs instead of polishing them into a smooth sheen. It's not as DIY charming as his earlier works, but it's pretty darned effective. For example, piano and (fake) strings aside, ""Poised and Ready"" is pure guitar rush and snarl, supporting by pounding drums and throbbing bass. ""A Whole Lot Better"", too, rather than going for pat uplift on the chorus, instead piles the intensity on even heavier, all without losing sight of the massive hooks driving the song. The ""la la"" singalong ""Don't Want to Talk"", the squiggly synth-adorned kiss-off anthem ""Borrow"", the mock-Motown meets ELO of ""Garbage Day"", and the proto new wave-channeling ""Feel Like Taking You Home"" all wield their relentless infectiousness with relish. Yet My Old, Familiar Friend isn't some document of cathartic rage (predictable undercurrent of romantic woes aside). Rather, this is pure, unbridled joy in recorded form. ""I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day,"" sings Benson in ""A Whole Lot Better"". ""I feel a whole lot better when you come around."" He might as well be describing the instant listener/song relationships fueled and formed by a lifetime of restless radio station surfing, favorite songs coming and going, many brightening up those bad days and making those long car trips go by that much faster. Back in the 1970s, Benson would have surely been held in the same esteem as many of those aforementioned AM titans. Here in 2009, he's merely the kind of best-kept secret you want to share with anyone who will listen.","The other Raconteurs singer-songwriter returns with his first solo album in the spotlight enjoyed as an occassional musical partner of Jack White.

Luminous Night,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59d9d034d5c69bf3337/1:1/w_160/38c452b7.jpg,2009-08-10 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13352-luminous-night/,Drag City,"Ben Chasny is one of the more prolific musicians of the last decade. He's released one or two albums each year since 1998 under his Six Organs of Admittance banner, plus a bunch of EPs, one-offs, and 7""s, and because that didn't keep him busy enough, he's also worked with Comets on Fire, Badgerlore, and Current 93. It could be argued that he's done more than anyone to establish, develop, and fuel this whole modern freak-folk thing, even if his profile has never risen as high as some of his peers'. Luminous Night continues Chasny's association with Chicago's estimable Drag City label, and it's something of a summary record, demonstrating most of the range he's shown over the years, from pretty acoustic guitar ramblings to ambient noodling, droning psychedelic horrors, acid folk tunes, and rumbling noise. It's heaviest on the middle three and has an overall dirge-like quality that wears a bit thin at times. The record opens with a fake-out of gorgeous acoustic plucking on ""Actaeon's Fall (Against the Hounds)"", a sound that harks back to School of the Flower. This is joined by jazzy flute and an even prettier surfed-out guitar before everything stops for a breath and comes back in on a decidedly more medieval note, the flute joining a viola on a positively ancient-sounding melody that occasionally lapses back into surf-jazz for a couple seconds. Taken in the context of the whole album, ""Actaeon's Fall"" plays something like a palate cleanser for the extended exercise in existential dread that follows. Chasny's oddly deadpan, almost British-accented voice makes a good instrument for brooding, and he almost makes a point of separating his brand of acid folk from his hippie forebears by confronting his personal failings head-on, declaring, ""I'm a vengeful man,"" on ""Anesthesia"" as harshly droning guitars crowd in around him. He wraps himself in thoughts of death on ""Ursa Minor"", singing, ""Love can't keep death at bay/ Good people dying everywhere/ When shadow's your doctor the price you pay/ Is asking if god is even there."" Chasny is careful to cut through the pallor of the densest tracks with small splashes of color, like the tabla that drives ""Bar-Nasha"" or the piano that wafts through the electronic haze of ""Cover Your Wounds With the Sky"". Eyvind Kang leads ""River of Heaven"" with a haunting viola solo played in a style that sounds half European Renaissance and half Syrian. Genuinely haunting moments like that forgive some of the album's more egregious indulgences in drifting noise and intentional obfuscation (see the brown guitar squall in the middle of ""Enemies Before the Light""). But really, half the fun of Six Organs is hearing Chasny get away with being over-the-top on the strength of his sheer talent. Luminous Night doesn't challenge School of the Flower or The Sun Awakens for Six Organs' best albums, but it is a solid addition to a big catalog that gets more interesting all the time.","Latest from the prolific and influential avant-folk artist is something of a summary record, demonstrating most of the range he's shown over the years.

King of Jeans,Pissed Jeans,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59c5e6ef95969320b47/1:1/w_160/dc57faba.jpg,2009-08-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13360-king-of-jeans/,Sub Pop,"When Pennsylvania scuzz-punks Pissed Jeans released their Sub Pop debut, Hope for Men, two years ago, the album seemed to represent a noble if financially foolhardy way for the label to reinvest their Shins and Postal Service profits. Though Sub Pop, of course, first built its empire two decades ago on caustic, post-hardcore rock, the few signees to mine that tradition since the mid-1990s-- from godheadSilo to Murder City Devils to the Catheters-- tended to have tokenistic standing on an increasingly diversified and commercially viable roster. Pissed Jeans thus appeared to be the latest addition to this lunatic fringe: one that provided a spiritual link to the imprint's storied past, but-- given the limited crossover potential for caterwauling, guttural noise-core-- hardly a foundation for their future. But two years later, our appetite for absurdist punk-rock seems to be on an uptick. The Jesus Lizard and Butthole Surfers are hitting the reunion-tour circuit, playing venues larger than the ones they filled in their heydays; Fucked Up have scored Fox News-pundit gigs and a nomination for Canada's Polaris Music Prize. Pissed Jeans, meanwhile, have answered this pigfuck-apoolaza with an album that could potentially elevate the band to Sub Pop franchise players. If Hope for Men was distinguished by the canyon-wide chasm between the band's ugly aggression and frontman Matt Korvette's seemingly frivolous lyrical concerns (the potential for a Whole Foods sponsorship remains sadly unrealized), King of Jeans successfully consolidates these two strengths, harnessing the earlier record's sometimes directionless fire-extinguisher splatter into shake-appealing rock action, and cohering Korvette's ramblings into a more complete picture of wage-slave misanthropy and alpha-male inadequacy. On paper, that latter part might read like the makings of a mid-life crisis record (Ã  la the Wrens' Meadowlands), but the difference is Korvette wears his failure like a badge of honor. And where Hope for Men's carpet-bomb onslaught sometimes obscured the relatable quality of Korvette's observations, on King of Jeans, they're organized into shout-back slogans cathartic enough to keep enraged 9-to-5ers from going postal: on opener ""False Jesii Part 2"", Korvette answers a litany of social pressures-- from going to the gym to wearing a ""tight black shirt""-- with a boisterous holler of ""I don't bother!"" before celebrating his slothfulness with a playground-taunt chorus of ""nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah,"" all to the steady beat of a tambourine, no less. No one's going to confuse this with pop music, of course, but Pissed Jeans have certainly become more economical and precise in their attack-- gone are Hope for Men's extended exercises in textural noise terror (""People Person"") and piano-blues concrÃ¨te (""Scrapbooking""). In its place are two-minute Germs infections (""Human Upskirt""), Buttholes blurts (""Pleasure Race""), and crazed Nick Cave cattle calls (""Half Idiot""-- a soulmate to ""Zoo-Music Girl"").Â And in ""Request for Masseuse"", we hear the closest Pissed Jeans will probably ever get to a slow-jam: over guitarist Bradley Fry and bassist Randy Huth's oozing Iommi/Butler riff, Korvette lists off a series of instructions for his personal-ad pleasure-giver; when drummer Sean McGuinness kicks into the lurching groove 90 seconds in, Korvette lets out the creepiest sigh ever, graphically confirming the ending was a happy one. But if ""Request for Masseuse"" represents a rare expression of joy for Korvette, King of Jeans' centerpiece track, ""Spent"", underscores how fleeting such moments really are. At seven minutes, the song is about three times as long as the average track here, but rather than being the most elaborate piece, it's the most despairingly regressive. Where King of Jeans' more compact tracks provide us the opportunity to scream or laugh along with Korvette's complaints, ""Spent"" is a 16-rpm Melvins-grade sludge feast that slows down the self-loathing commentary to ensure we feel every second of his agony; after counting off the ways his life sucks (""I went and got my car back/ There's a new noise this time""), he finally loses it when he realizes that even a ""cold glass of water... [doesn't] satisfy."" Recent history tells us that angry, confrontational music tends to flourish during Republican administrations, but King of Jeans illuminates the problems that plague the working man-- receding hairlines, the inability to relate to girls, the transactional nature of romance, the impossibility of proper cuticle maintenance-- regardless of who's running the country or how the economy is doing. The bumper sticker may say ""Yes we can,"" but the guy driving the leased Hyundai on which it's affixed is still left there staring at himself in the rearview mirror, thinking, ""No, dude, I really can't.""","Latest from Pennsylvania scuzz-punk revivalists consolidates their strengths, harnessing their fire-extinguisher splatter into shake-appealing rock action.

Bay of Pigs EP,Destroyer,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a596b1335d7bf1698c28/1:1/w_160/10fdf6ab.jpg,2009-08-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13351-bay-of-pigs-ep/,Merge,"""So listen,"" Destroyer's Dan Bejar confides/boasts at the top of ""Bay of Pigs"", ""I've been drinking."" It's a line you could affix to the front of just about any of Bejar's glam-folk tunes; he does, after all, tend to sing like he's trying to blow the last fleck of Chianti from his bottom lip. But here it is, leading off what's now Destroyer's longest track (by several minutes) in a catalog peppered with epics. The rumors were indeed true, as ""Bay of Pigs"" is in fact an ""ambient disco"" number, a couple of genres that even for the ever-eclectic Bejar seems oddly foreign on paper. I mean, Destroyer goes disco? The guy must've been under the goddamned table when he came up with that one. This sprawl, paired with that succinct, near-summation of a first line-- oh yeah, and the dozen-minute screed that follows-- makes ""Bay of Pigs"", if not the single best Destroyer song, certainly the ultimate. It's an exceptional work, a surrealistic epic rich in novelistic tone and texture and sometimes shockingly vivid in its imagery. But it's also a 13-and-half-minute long Destroyer song in a spacey, eventually lite-disco style, and it's rife with all the quirk and self-reference of your favorite Bejar song, and then some. An entry point for curious New Pornographers fans this ain't. The narrative is as troubled and prone to time-lapse and footnotes as you'd expect from Bejar's longest-ever tome; the tune is ostensibly about the botched 1961 Cuban invasion, but for an aside or 12 our narrator cops to being 20 years old in 1992, throwing up in an English garden, his antler-wearing conquest all the while lost in the desert. And, hey, maybe there's Christine, stowing away from Destroyer's Rubies' ""Painter in Your Pocket"", to whom Bejar refers as the rage-inducing object of his affections. Getting one's head around a tale this sinewy and sprawling is no easy task, and while Bejar's done exceptionally well in widescreen, the blowhard majesty of his compositions can wear one down after the third rave-up. But ""Bay of Pigs"" feels about half as long as the actually half-as-long ""Shooting Rockets"" from last year's fine Trouble in Dreams, and, weirdly enough, it's the disco that keeps you from flagging out around minute nine. That said, don't go looking for your minimal dubstep Balearic whaddyacallit here; ""Bay of Pigs"" sounds like a synth rock band playing disco, and more specifically, like Destroyer playing disco, having never met a big build they didn't like. As such, the track burbles to a slow start, synths twinkling around Bejar as he explains away the booze on his breath. It's essentially one synth wash after another for a spell, swarming around Bejar's words before settling into a stuttery New Ordery synth pattern, a wet slap of a beat, and a little Spanish guitar. You'd look awfully funny trying to dance to the largely low-end-deficient first half or so, but ""Pigs"" gets a pretty good groove going about halfway through, pulling in all the elements from before and marrying them with a startlingly apt dancefloor refrain: ""Free and easy/ Gentle gentle/ The wind through the trees makes you mental/ For me"". The track stays out of Bejar's way when need be, helps carry over some of the wordier verses on the back of a thumpa or two, gets real good around the chorus, and then backs out slowly; it hangs onto the song like a rumpled sportcoat, the kind Bejar himself favors. Talk about your self-reference; on the flip of ""Pigs"" is ""Ravers"", a stripped-down, slowed-up take on Trouble in Dreams' ""Rivers"". It took me a minute, honestly; ""Rivers"" was a fairly peppy tune about ""a standoff with the fucking horizon,"" more notable for its easygoing chorus melody than its words, but ""Ravers"" finds Bejar sounding pickled and determined as he moans those very same lyrics over an even spacier synth wash than ""Pigs"". To hear Bejar, who sounds almost like he's being propped up to get through this one, wail this one out into the ether is practically to hear a completely different tune, and he imbues the song's central lines with a lot more feeling and pathos than the livelier LP version. Bejar's long been a songwriter of the highest order-- and ""Pigs"", butt-minded sonics and all, is one of his finest-- but his powers of performance and interpretation have nearly caught up in the last few years. Bay of Pigs draws a clear line under that part of the Destroyer equation, as both songs here owe their successes to execution just as much as his early work got by on intent. I'd assume Bay of Pigs' disco diversion to be just that in the long run, but after the relatively wagon-gathering summary of Trouble in Dreams, this certainly feels like a break and, perhaps, the first blush of something new. Cheers to that.","The rumors were true: Dan Bejar's new two-song EP is boosted by a 13-minute-long slab of ambient disco, complete with footnote-worthy lyrics.

The Future's Looking Grim,Yea Big + Kid Static,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a594ea9e61561daa518c/1:1/w_160/b027abc1.jpg,2009-08-07 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13356-the-futures-looking-grim/,Jib Door,"Yeah Big and Kid Static have yet to catch any of the buzz awarded to local acts like Cool Kids or Kid Sister, but itâs not for lack of staying busy. The duo continues to appear on almost any bill, in front of any crowd, in any town, and if you haven't seen their names on a local listings, you might know them from their collaborations with the men of the Mae Shi, remixing their ""Run to Your Grave"" for the HLLYEA EP. Though their kindred spirits are a little left of traditional notions of hip-hop, Kid Static still lays nimble, easygoing rhymes over the dense and busy production of Yea Big, who also plays the gawky, sweatband-and-gym-short adorned hypeman for Static on stage. Whether you're a fan of glitch-inspired sci-fi rap production or not, Yea Big's work here is a potent argument for continuing to work the niche: it's always chintzy and threatening, robotic and organic, teeth-gritting and head-bobbing all at once. The tracks on The Future's Looking Grim were sent back and forth between the two principals, Postal Service-style, but you wouldn't know it from hearing it. The chemistry is still enough that Kid Static knows when to lead the track and when to let it pop, squelch, and thump on its own. There's a social message that occasionally creeps in from the sidelines (they carry ""two barrels of beats"" and are ""super-soakin with guns, not with skeetin"" in ""Middle America""), and yet Kid Static is becoming a strong enough MC that his flow alone is as compelling as the content. It's evident on the frenetic Nintendo beat of ""Stomp the Pedal"" that hides more thump and open space in its second return, while Kid Static's double-time flow and breathless inflection show his growth as a rapper. The same goes for when he slows down: ""The Nameless"" has him taking name-dropping to the most absurd heights possible while rhyming ""alphabet"" with ""Cox-Arquette."" It's a concept that might read as corny, but is exactly the kind of thing that can transform folded arms into smiles in an unfamiliar crowd. Yea Big, meanwhile, is all over the place-- jumping into juke in the outro of the opening track, providing giddy post-Neptunes bounce underneath the chip-tastic ""Mega Man"" valentine ""Bots"", receding into harsh static in the closing moments of the darker ""Dollar Bill Hat"", and combining jazzy hi-hat tapping with distorted bass hits in ""Rock Bottom Rock"". The fact that Kid Static can even keep up, let alone find a way in to these tracks, is saying something. Sonically, the album veers between a more relaxed and confident reiteration of the busy-but-laid-back rap of their first record and tracks that build an icy tension in their glitchier moments. Goosebumps are raised as bicycle-spoke percussion floats through an otherwise silent moment before the refrain of ""Down to the River"", and paranoia lurks over the shoulder of the nightmare-inspired ""Long Night"". Even ""Middle America"", which could easily be a theme song for the group, sounds a little tense and beleaguered. Though it's not completely fair to harp on a song that's more than a year old by now, ""Eatchyo Samwich"" is a good summation of Yea Big + Kid Static's strengths: they're usually at their best when they're smiling, and most potent when the track has just a little breathing room-- in this case, an unusually slinky beat that carries a ridiculous, occasionally uncomfortable extended riff on food-inspired braggadocio, with Static adopting a lantern-jaw tough-guy voice that rivals his regular tone. Yet even ""Samwich"" isn't quite the same without the pre-song anecdote Static delivers when they play it live. The icy pessimism of the record is compelling, but ""Samwich"" and ""The Nameless"" hint at how irrepressible and charming these guys are, and how they're comfortable in front of any audience. Above all else, the group is serious about being silly, and it's hard to get what they're about without seeing them dive into a crowd, scale a venue's walls, or turn their backs to the audience for some Supremes-worthy dance moves. Fortunately, The Future's Looking Grim comes a little closer to capturing that spirit.","Latest from Chicago MC/producer team finds them coming closer to capturing the charm of their live show.

Physical Changes,Jon Mueller,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53413d1975652138ebf/1:1/w_160/e017894d.jpg,2009-08-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13267-physical-changes/,Radium,"In September, the label Jagjaguwar will release Unmap, the debut of Volcano Choir, a new experimental project featuring Bon Iver aka Justin Vernon. Aside from Vernon's sympathetic falsetto, his potpourri approach to lyrics, and the vocal take from his previously released Vocoder curio ""Woods"", Volcano Choir shares little with its more famous brethren. An impressionistic affair gilded by occasional crescendos, Unmap trades rock and folk linearity for guitar notes that refract, bend, and sustain; drums that prowl, circle, and march; and a panoply of unfamiliar sounds that ping, swirl, and float. On ""Still"", a full-band update of ""Woods"", all of those elements--Â Vernon's voice, the band's luminous matrix of tones and drums--Â coalesce into seven incredible minutes. The wintry chill of Vernon's solo take becomes a slow, icy burn here, the sting fastidiously increased by drums that spread patiently through the mix until, by climax, your chest feels like it is the kick drum. The locomotive beneath ""Still"" is Jon Mueller, a fringe percussionist and improviser living in Milwaukee. He's long stood just at the edge of indie notoriety, formerly with Polyvinyl jazz benders Pele and now with Collections of Colonies of Bees, the often-brilliant quintet that's the other piece of the Volcano Choir chimera. Apart from those acts, Mueller has cultivated a sprawling discography of outsider collaborations with people like resonance expert Z'EV and environmental audio plunderer Jeph Jerman. With his bands, Mueller's drumming emphasizes power and precision. Those collaborations, though, often exploit texture, building rich sprawls of sound from unlikely tones. On last year's Metals and this year's Physical Changes, Mueller's first and second eponymous albums for Table of the Elements' Radium imprint, the twain meet in long-form pieces that combine the explosiveness of his timekeeping and the expansiveness of his sound-making. Metals' two tracks wound wires of noise around heavy-metal marathons, blurring each bludgeon until they became one bulk sound.Â Physical Changes goes further, surrounding Mueller's drums with the varied dins of collaborators--Â the guitar of Khanate's James Plotkin, the cello of Lightbox Orchestra leader Fred Lonberg-Holm, the synthesizer of Collections of Colonies of Bees bandmate Jim Schoenecker-- that threaten to rip whatever rhythm arises apart. Two hours of these escalating, dense pieces are split over five tracks on a DVD, CD, and LP. A gauntlet of focus and endurance, then, Physical Changes teases the divides between beats and bedlam, composition and improvisation, insanity and intensity. By set's end, it establishes Mueller as an audacious ringleader for new music. The title of this collection and of the tracks therein--Â ""Things Will Not Stay the Way They Are"" and ""Change Is the Only Evidence of Life"", to cite two--Â serve as a sort of convenient credo for Mueller's music. Superficially, these five pieces can be quickly categorized as drones, in that they find a sonic space and pursue it doggedly. But as with many Table of the Elements artists, stopping there would be at the expense of the nuance and dynamics these tracks offer. As the titles hint, they're always shifting, even if slightly, letting sounds rise and fade, blend and break. ""Nothing Changes"", the first track of the set's CD and the real masterpiece, stretches a bell tone until it's long and thin. The track swells for 10 minutes as an arco cello sends shocks of dissonance through the music. Mueller rips into a drum roll that he releases about 25 minutes later, or as the track expires. But the sounds surrounding the drums shift constantly, changing the way Mueller's static beat fits into the frame. Sometimes, it's a background wash. Other times, it's at the front, lashing at open air. Similarly, ""The Only Constant Thing is Change"" sounds like a rock band bursting from the inside of a cauldron in waves of chaos and silence. Electric tumult splits Mueller's rhythm at the side, and no sound sticks around too long. That's the point emphasized by ""Survival Is Not Mandatory"", an accompanying 36-minute collaboration with video artist David Dinnell. Dinnell blurs familiar images--Â trees in the wind, a deer drinking in a brook, a still lake--Â until they look like lunar landscapes. He shifts from one scene to the next, alternately overexposing and underexposing his film so that nothing dominates a frame too long. Mueller's sound achieves the same effect, bits and pieces slipping in and out of a composite roar so that, even after 30 minutes, the music seems still very nebulous. It feels condescending to suggest that Physical Changes won't readily appeal to fans of Bon Iver or Volcano Choir. Strangely, it feels vaguely incorrect, too: Though Mueller's music is often chaotic and distorted (perhaps to the point of being indiscernible from one moment to the next), it is the product of singular vision and steadfast will. Its focus transcends mere sound, so--Â for those who seek no apology in their music--Â there's the potential for broader appeal. What's more, Mueller pulls a few collaborators and, to an extent, his audience into the tide of his own ideas. In this way, Physical Changes is not altogether unlike a James Blackshaw record, where friends help the young English guitarist lift his mesmerizing guitar takes into bigger, better songs. But let's not downplay Physical Changes' visceral roar too much: It's an impolite, unflinching record, loudly making its case as one of the year's boldest statements.","Despite spending time with Pele, Collections of Colonies of Bees, and Volcano Choir, uncompromising percussionist Jon Mueller is arguably best on his own.

Dark Rift,Pictureplane,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5905e6ef95969320b25/1:1/w_160/3b157c8d.jpeg,2009-08-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13347-dark-rift/,Lovepump United,"More electronic artists should use the MTV Party to Go series as a jumping-off point. Sure, it's risky, but at a time when everything else is fair game for interpretation and reconfiguration-- dancehall, dub, deep house, Balearic-- why not go for broke and hang your hat on hits like Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's ""Good Vibrations"" or CeCe Peniston's ""Finally""? This music was all good times and no pretense, and it managed to spark some much-needed mainstream discussion about electronic music here in the U.S., however vapid and disingenuous those compilations may have seemed. When this sort of spic-and-span, popwise techno music hit, Denver's Pictureplane, aka Travis Egedy, was in grade school-- an age when sonic consumption is passive. So it makes sense that his mostly solid full-length debut LP asks the question: Where were u in '92? Dark Rift manages to extol the virtues of those sugarcoated dance music templates while still working within the parameters of punk DIY. Most of the record feels like a well-curated basement party mixtape; it bounces around enough to keep things ripe, despite sticking to the same few Korg effects and raygun bloops on nearly every cut. Egedy clearly feels comfortable style-hopping, though you could likely tag a number of sub-genres within every song-- from the Afrobeat-heavy ""Time Teens"" to the dancehall designated ""5th Sun"", things are left largely uncluttered so an idea can fully flesh itself out before we move on to the next one. Jungle and garage inflections rear their heads at nearly every turn, but they're mostly cleansed of their gutter appeal and newly reupholstered in glitter and gold lamÃ©. Throughout, Egedy finds a way to unearth these like-minded genres' deep roots in glam and disco, so don't let that deliberate layer of noise splashed over the mix fool you: Despite the Massive Attack-pruned atmospherics on cuts like ""Transparent Now (Thin Veil)"", Pictureplane's sound ultimately lives and dies by the smoke machine. Dark Rift's two best moments-- ""Goth Star"" and ""Gang Signs""-- hint at another possible path. Both are a little languid and frayed and they seem very much in the now, a time when clipped vocals and delayed synth loops are allowed to nurture the groove instead of stifle it. Rather than working an endless disco suite or breakbeat, Egedy here manipulates samples with the best of them, revealing a keen ear for sound-melding that pushes past those nostalgia-inducing rave-ups into a more affecting realm. Given the force of those moments, you might expect some of the cheeky early-90s referencing to sound weak in contrast, but two-steppers like ""New Mind"" and ""Dimensional Rip III"" still succeed on their own terms, happy to appeal to the disembodied-female-hook and laser-effect set. Indeed, the propulsive, strobe-streaked allegiance to the mainstream dance music of days gone by is ultimately the most admirable thing about Dark Rift. Pictureplane's music has its weaknesses-- the breathy vocal whine on every track is flatly injected and grating-- but there are enough lo-fi footnotes, grab-bag genre references, and sprightly hooks to draw in a variety of listeners.","On his proper full-length debut, Denver's Travis Egedy combines samples and an ear for the best parts of dance pop from an earlier era.

But a little subterfuge can still go a long way. On his hit single, 22-year-old singer/rapper Drake insists, ""This one's for you,"" then cops some ""gray sweatpants, no makeup"" sweet talk en route to envisioning himself ""all up in your slot."" He recently admitted to MTV that ""it's not the most heartfelt song."" Where Drake talks dirty and sounds Auto-Tune clean, the Smith Westerns take the opposite approach. Like the Beatles, though, these four Chicago teenagers don't want to hold your hand-- they want to do more. Don't let the Fab Four mention throw you: From this young Windy City group, retro-rock doesn't feel like a history class. Rummaging through 1970s glam, Phil Spector teen-pop, and Nuggets garage-punk with the youthful abandon of kids finding new toys in the attic, the Smith Westerns' self-titled debut exudes an earnestness almost as pure as its recording levels are deafening. Their simple, sweet choruses about boys and girls in love could spike the punch at a 1970s TV show (OK, ""Freaks & Geeks""/""That '70s Show"") school dance. Parent chaperones would be none the wiser. When singing guitarist Cullen Omori, his bassist brother Cameron, second guitarist Max Kakacek, and a drummer known to Google only as Hal have the tunes to make themselves heard over their vintage aesthetic, The Smith Westerns' teenage kicks are hard to beat. Take string-swept glam ballad ""Be My Girl"", which softly punctuates one of the year's most wrenchingly innocent hooks with somewhat pervier pick-up lines. There's less lyrical subtext, but no less raunchy production, on the glam-rock boogie of ""Girl in Love"", a come-on cursorily addressing the fleetingness of youth. It's only fitting that in a year-old YouTube video featuring scratchy sockhop swooner ""Tonight"", the Smith Westerns both look and sound like the Black Lips' good-bad not-evil twins. These guys are sort of literally true to their school-- garage-rocker Miss Alex White is a fellow Northside College Prep magnet-school alum-- and their time on the road with the likes of Jay Reatard and Nobunny is evident on fine 60s-style frat-rocker ""Gimme Some Time"". With fuzzed-out xylophone, frenetic opener ""Dreams"" suggests the group's most recent tour with Girls and Los Campesinos! might serve them better for a follow-up. ""Diamond Boys"" almost earns its piano on the strength of its adolescent grandiosity, but ""We Stay Out"" lets lo-fi become the end rather than the means, with a guitar line that sounds like a bee buzzing underwater. Japandroids, another loud punkish group concerned with youth and girls, ask a cathartic question on Post-Nothing's ""The Boys Are Leaving Town"". DFA signees Free Energy channel Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" on their recent ""Dream City"" single. The Smith Westerns turn to lighthearted psych-folk for their own declaration: ""Boys Are Fine"". Then, on blithely woo-oohing fuzz-popper ""The Glam Goddess"", they actually go and say it: ""I wanna hold your hand."" Boys will be boys.","Rummaging through glam, teen-pop, andÂ garage-punk, this Chicago band exudes an earnestness almost as pure as its recording levels are deafening.

Woodstock 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm,Various Artists,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55ab1335d7bf1698b9c/1:1/w_160/c0fe06f1.jpg,2009-08-07 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13302-woodstock-40-years-on-back-to-yasgurs-farm/,Rhino,"The forgotten secret of Woodstock is that it kind of sucked. Culturally, of course, it was a beautiful thing-- half a million kids found each other and everything was groovy. The audience was a generation with high ideals, crazy dreams, unreliable drugs, and an inexplicable fondness for Crosby, Stills & Nash, and it finally had something to pull it together that didn't involve all that many things being set on fire. The port-a-potties were overflowing by Friday night, and the flower people left tons of garbage rotting all over Max Yasgur's farm, but it's generally remembered as a positive social experience by people who claim they were there. The music, on the other hand, didn't entirely live up to the event's rep, and there's been a certain diminishing-returns effect from the recordings that have been released. The first Woodstock album was a 1970 triple-album that cherry-picked the festival's musical highlights-- 18 acts, give or take, most of them limited to a track apiece. (Crosby, Stills & Nash, with and without Young, got three.) Then there was a double LP a year later, with some second-tier performances and three more CSNY songs. The 25th anniversary 4xCD box set had all the music from those records, plus some other stuff, minus the iconic between-song announcements (""the brown acid that is circulating around us is not, specifically, too good""). Now we've got this six-disc monster, with a bit under half of the music that was played the weekend of August 15, 1969, plus a healthy sampling of stage patter. (The unabridged version will, one assumes, come out on subcutaneous nanotech in the year 2024, by which time most of the festival's attendees will be well into their seventies.) It's newly mixed from the original, unsweetened master tapes, with miraculous clarity, so ha ha on you, Neil Young, Ravi Shankar and Mountain-- no taking a mulligan on performances you were unhappy with for this edition! And it's got at least a song or two from almost every act that played the festival. The missing ones are the negligible Keef Hartley Band, Ten Years After-- who were actually on the original triple-LP-- and the Band, who were apparently bummed out that everyone just wanted Bob Dylan to show up on stage with them. (They reportedly played his ""I Shall Be Released"", as did Joan Baez and Joe Cocker, although none of those versions show up here.) There are a handful of deserving excavations on the box. Country Joe & the Fish get to demonstrate that there's more to their groove-garage than the two minutes of ""Rock & Soul Music"" that made the movie soundtrack (although maybe not the half an hour more's worth they get here), and it's nice to hear Bert Sommer's elegant, pastoral meditations and the Incredible String Band's people-of-the-forest folk. There are also some less-than deserving exhumations, like Sweetwater, who get a pair of warbly numbers with flute solos that are not, specifically, too good, and Quill, Bostonian Zappaphiles who went on first on Saturday and promptly sank back into obscurity. Jimi Hendrix's closing set was preceded by Sha Na Na, whose squeaky-clean 50s nostalgia might have seemed like it provided some kind of connection to rock's roots; that's probably the kindest possible spin on it. The low point of Back to Yasgur's Farm is its third disc: Canned Heat jammin' (with an apostrophe) on a boogie that seems much longer than its actual half-hour, the Grateful Dead's dud of a ""Dark Star"", and Creedence Clearwater Revival brusquely replicating their studio recordings' ragged intonation. Still, some bands managed to pull off ace performances, even under Woodstock's ghastly conditions. The Who were apparently miserable, tripping on acid they hadn't realized they were ingesting in the backstage refreshments, and unable to hear themselves in the monitors when they finally got to go on at 4 a.m. Somehow, that translated into a blistering, furious rendition of ""Tommy"", of which 18 minutes appear here, including the legendary onstage confrontation between Abbie Hoffman (who grabs the mike and starts whining about John Sinclair) and Pete Townshend (who growls ""Fuck off my fucking stage!"" and whacks him with his guitar. Go Pete!). There are other moments of inspiration-- maybe about a CD's worth, all told. Some of them surfaced on the original triple-LP: Joe Cocker's wild-eyed swan dive into ""With a Little Help From My Friends"", Richie Havens' high-friction acoustic ramble ""Freedom"", and especially Sly and the Family Stone's peak-after-peak-after-peak ""I Want to Take You Higher"". Jefferson Airplane's ""Volunteers"" roars, and so does their previously unreleased cover of Fred Neil's ""The Other Side of This Life""; hearing Melanie transformed from an unknown to a minor star over the course of a few songs is pretty adorable. And yes, Jimi Hendrix's gloriously audacious ""Star-Spangled Banner"" deserves its place of pride. By that point, most of the hippie masses were straggling home, but whoever was left on that muddy field on that Monday morning was very lucky. As the old joke goes, though, if they can remember it, they weren't really there.","Cultural institution is honored with a 6xCD box from Rhino.

Psychic Maps,Dysrhythmia,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59213d1975652138fae/1:1/w_160/8a20d582.jpg,2009-08-06 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13359-psychic-maps/,Relapse,"If the world were just, Kevin Hufnagel would be a guitar hero. Guitar magazines would feature him on covers, and people would play his tunes with plastic toy guitars. But Hufnagel does not tease his hair enough for magazine coverage. Nor does he play trendy music. Instead, he has pursued idiosyncratic musical paths. Dysrhythmia, an instrumental trio, is his main band. With Dysrhythmia bassist Colin Marston, he does Byla, an avant-garde ambient project. He also records solo acoustic guitar records under his own name. Hufnagel can play circles around more famous guitar ""shredders."" The conventional model of a guitar hero is a lanky fellow emitting streams of notes during the middles of songs. Such playing is usually linear, one note after another, and often depends on rhythm guitar underneath to keep the song going.Â Hufnagel has no such luxury, nor does he need it. As Dysrhythmia's sole guitarist, he renders obsolete terms like ""rhythm"" and ""lead guitar."" He plays high, he plays low, he plays everything in between.Â Hufnagel does not play notes so much as describe worlds. In this way, he recalls Al Di Meola, who uses his immense speed not towards left hand heroics, but towards percussive picking patterns. Hufnagel sketches outlines of chords, then fills them in with various tones and adds outside notes for color. The result evokes audible alien paintings. Dysrhythmia's sound hasn't changed over time so much as come into focus. Their songs are instantly recognizable for their chewy tones, muscular dissonance, and roiling percussion. If 1990s noise rock had acquired shredder chops, it might sound like Dysrhythmia. The band has a few sonic cohorts, like Don Caballero and Keelhaul. But Dysrhythmia is more willing to soar above its odd-metered foundation. Hufnagel can unspool leads as elegantly as Joe Satriani or Steve Vai. However, he reins in this aspect on Psychic Maps. The record is Dysrhythmia's darkest and densest yet. ""Festival of Popular Delusions"" approaches thrash and death metal at times. The precise picking of ""Iron Cathedral"" suggests Megadeth in the 31st century. ""Reactionary"" is thrusting and elastic, like an angry Primus. ""Room of Vertigo"" lives up to its name, as Marston unleashes torrents of throbbing low end. ""Lifted by Skin"" is the exception to such relentlessness, with hummingbird picking forming webs of electric ambience. Never the most accessible band, Dysrhythmia have become even more inscrutable on Psychic Maps. Its beefy tones and immense virtuosity are almost like armor. This yields a more difficult listen than the band's last few releases, which wielded more space and quiet. Now the band feels big and menacing. It's almost a prelude to Gorguts, the legendary Canadian death metal band that recently recruited Hufnagel and Marston. Perhaps these tunes are best suited for the live setting, where the band is formidable. It's arty, it's math-y, and one can definitely headbang to it.","Inscrutable metal band, led by guitarist Kevin Hufnagel, releases its latest Relapse record.

"My Favorite Things, Vol. 2",Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4db13d1975652138deb/1:1/w_160/bc3b34ff.jpg,2009-08-06 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13174-my-favorite-things-vol-2/,Mule,"Label comps are the stepchildren of the dance world, providing none of the functionality of your typical format: they lack the exclusivity and collectability of a new 12"", the statement-making of a mix, or the cohesiveness of a proper LP. Labels like Mule Electronic complicate the situation further, as we can't ascribe to them any scene or sound specific enough to rally behind (think Kompakt's Total series or the Skull Disco comps). Despite this, Mule Electronic, which trades chiefly in varying strands of minimal and techno, has served as a worthy home for some of this decade's most productive, creative electronic acts.Â My Favorite Things, Vol. 2, featuring exclusive and/or upcoming tracks from artists like IsolÃ©e, Minilogue, Move D, and DJ Koze, offers a chance to delve (slightly) deeper into the catalogs of some favored artists. My Favorite Things, Vol. 2 celebrates Japan-based Mule's fifth anniversary, and it's as much a marketing opportunity as a party: In addition to the headlining acts mentioned above, MFT2 offers peeks into comparative unknowns like (recent Mule signee) Foog, Ribn (a new project from Manuel Tur), and Strategy. There's no need to search for a unifying sound or theme on a comp like this, but the mood of MFT2 is dreamy and expansive, though aggressive, tech-y pulses from Ribn (""Lum Lum"") and Strategy (""My Synthetic Guitar"") will snap any drooping eyelids. The sound of the comp is almost perfectly summed by ""Jill"", an album-track preview from Dial co-owner Lawrence. A clacky, metronomic beat taps industriously under an alternating bass figure and slurred, ambient keyboards. Newcomer Foog's ""Kanazawa"" is one of the track's dancier beats, featuring a tunneling bass channel and way-off, smeared blasts of Rhodes, like deep house with any trace of disco orientation beaten out of it. The big guns alternate between the rote (IsolÃ©e's funky but strangely wanting ""Albacares"") and the exciting: Move D's brilliantly named ""Happylock"" is twitchy and floor-oriented in ways that last year's (still excellent) Songs From the Beehive was not. The big winners are Minilogue, whose ""My Teenager Gang"" (now a 12"") offers 10 minutes of vinyl-heated, tropic jam. Beginning with a rollicking deep-house bleat, the track accumulates chattering rainforest sounds and youthful chants; ""My Teenager Gang"" surpasses nearly everything from the dance-oriented half of last year's Animals. Other highlights include Koss' ""Earth (Ãme Remix)"", which provides loose, urban-wilds shuffle, and the still-underrated DJ Koze's ""First Snow"", which closes MFT2 with a gorgeous, organ-tinted fadeout. My Favorite Things, Vol. 2 isn't essential listening-- tech fans will likely accumulate this material more organically, and Mule still lacks a true crossover success-- but for anyone looking to take a second step into a favorite artist, or perhaps anyone lacking the time (or locale) to scour new-arrival 12""'s, MFT2 is a mostly winning collection from a steady, commendable label.","Japan-based Mule Electronic celebrates its fifth anniversary with a set featuring exclusive tracks fromÂ IsolÃ©e, Minilogue, Move D, Lawrence, and DJ Koze.

Speech Therapy,Speech Debelle,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5955e6ef95969320b33/1:1/w_160/a848a9eb.jpg,2009-08-06 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13354-speech-therapy/,Big Dada,"A couple of months before the UK release of her first album, Speech Therapy, before she received a surprise Mercury Prize nomination, Speech Debelle mused on Twitter, ""There are some white people in the music business who think im not black enough... lol"". No shit: Even in a ""post-race"" world, street sells. Certain British journalists predictably pounced on lyrics about a period in Debelle's late teens idled among London's demimonde of crack mums and minor crooks, spinning a tiny bit of flash into blinding bling. Fact is, she was raised in a middle-class Jamaican neighborhood south of the Thames where she, uh, attended school and studied music and wrote poetry. Debelle doesn't so much map ""street"" as girl-next-door or Speech-from-the-block. Wherever she's from, anyway, some hip-hop fans will likely write her off because the usual American rap signifiers-- samples, seething synths, bombastic beats, and buckets of braggadocio-- play scant part in her artistic agenda. But if Debelle can't win the authenticity game, so be it; The baby-faced, mature-minded 26-year old has debuted with a fine, fresh, serious (yet never dour) album that speaks for itself, thanks. Wayne Lotek (Roots Manuva, who makes an appearance) produces the 13-track set on a spacious, spontaneous, even improvisational-sounding jazz tip with understated string, key, woodwind, and brass arrangements. It's hard to imagine a more effacing intro to someone being billed as UK hip-hop's next big thing as ""Searching""'s tremulous guitar and brushed cymbals, which only slowly crack the door to a secret of skittish beats and Debelle's anxious ""2 a.m. in my hostel bed, my eyes them red, my belly ain't fed."" Elsewhere, Lotek deploys everything from Afrobeat guitar lines to trumpet solos to new-agey bell tones, providing texture without upstaging Debelle's low-resting-pulse cadence. He's not trying to upstage her, anyway. Knockout single ""The Key"" is cool for Debelle's relaxed, conversational delivery, but gets its heat from a clarinet's serpentine swish and the way all the instruments pile on her voice in the last minute like a hill of ants on a dropped donut. Ultimately, though, Speech Therapy isn't a producer's record, but an MC's. And the title's no feint: Speech lies supine on the couch for the full 50 minutes. Fortunately, whether she's sifting through the anguish she's caused her mother and the trouble she's having finishing her album, or realizing that good sex can make for bad boyfriends and that even sucky jobs serve some cosmic purpose, she generally cuts through the crap without pretending to have easy answers. If you think you've heard everything about absent, irresponsible fathers and the children who tear their own insides out loving them, Debelle, in ""Daddy's Little Girl"", is casual but ruthlessly right-on: ""Daddy, I think I love you 'cause I hate you so much that I must love you"". Which isn't to say she doesn't sometimes copy captions from baby animal posters. Debelle credits tough American female MCs like Lil' Kim with artistic inspiration, but her outlook's far more pacifist and optimistic-- even erring on the side of naÃ¯vete. The same song (""Spinning"") that kills it with the couplet, ""This is for the tat on my wrist/ This is for the black of my fist,"" also whimpers ""One day all people will be all equal/ Until that day comes I'll just be singing my song"". To make sense of such inconsistencies, it helps to think of Debelle in relation to a less-violent Brithop tradition and to impossible-to-peg (and, yeah, inconsistent) contemporaries Lady Sovereign or Micachu. (The latter pops in on ""Better Days"" to don her Miss Ubiquity 2009 sash and execute an underwhelming smile-wave-turn move.) Hip-hop could use a less rigid paradigm, less insularity, more girls on the mic. I suspect plenty of people with a greater investment in this genre would disagree and dismiss Speech Therapy as coffeehouse rap. Debelle anticipates that reaction, though, with the record's final lyric: ""I understand this is my speech therapy, this ain't rap."" But it could be.","Rising UK hip-hop artist earned a Mercury Prize nomination for thisÂ fine, fresh, serious (yet never dour) album.

Alien in a Garbage Dump,Eric Copeland,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55c9d034d5c69bf32a5/1:1/w_160/714afaa5.jpg,2009-08-06 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13303-alien-in-a-garbage-dump/,Paw Tracks,"To paraphrase Nate Dogg, if you smoke like Eric Copeland smoke, then you're high like every day. And at some point on that MÃ¶bius strip, the routine transmissions of life-- TV chatter, street chatter, radio chatter-- morph into otherworldly assaults, mounting evidence of a conspiracy against human peace. Hippies called this ""turning on."" But pop art proved that there were ways to embrace the noise without surrendering to it. Scanning the backside of culture for fleas, discovering American gods in the grain of public access shows, etc.-- ways that you could baptize, by fire, whatever grotesqueries the TV Fast Food Complex fed you as a kid. It's why twenty- and thirty-somethings are out making paintings influenced by bootleg Bart Simpson T-shirts or ""video art"" like ""Wonder Showzen"" (a deformed twin of ""Sesame Street"" by people who presumably have never met a child), or why Ariel Pink has an audience. Eric Copeland-- one-third of New York's Black Dice-- is a lifeguard in this world. Alien in a Garbage Dump, a CD issue of two vinyl-only EPs, sounds like the soundtrack for Chuck E. Cheese's memorable 1993 ad ""Ultimate Pizza"", time stretched and desiccated by effects boxes. Or like what Panda Bear's Person Pitch might sound like if Panda Bear was replaced by the doll from Childâs Play. Like an alien in a garbage dump. It's fun. I boogie to it. Grooves collide in what sound like accidents; ringtone-sized melodies are played and played and replayed and replayed and wrung out like roadkill. The songs bounce and reel. He never opens the window for air.Â Copeland exists in the world of noise and art music, but Alien's blissful repetitions are closer akin to hip-hop or the tireless elation of steel drum bands. After all, ""breaks"" were basically just the DJ finding the brightest beam of sunlight in a song and looping it till drool trickled from the audience's mouths. Apparently the searching, high-minded folks at British magazine The Wire have started calling music like this ""hypnagogic pop,"" a reference to the state between wakefulness and sleep. I don't buy it. Copeland-- and James Ferraro, and Nite Jewel, and all these coastal folks vomiting up crusty, 80s-inspired psychedelia-- are fully awake, just on some other side of reality. It's not hypnagogic-- it's stoned, daffy, and righteous. It's chewing up something familiar and making it weird again. Life gives you lemons, so you make Alien in a Garbage Dump.","Black Dice leader compiles a pair of vinyl-only EPs onto CD, and the whole thing sounds like a psychedelic version of childhood.

Elephant Jokes,Robert Pollard,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55113d1975652138f07/1:1/w_160/f0b2c7bc.jpg,2009-08-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13293-elephant-jokes/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","It's just a couple of seconds long, but the few lurching guitar strums that kick off Robert Pollard's latest, Elephant Jokes, echo throughout the whole disc. For a man whose recorded output outpaces most major manufacturers, a slapdash Robert Pollard LP of particularly dour output seems at times the rule rather than the exception, and even tacking on a little flourish to get things going means Pollard's at least thought this one through to the beginning. The same could hardly be said for this winter's turgid, tossed-off The Crawling Distance, a record as easy to shrug off as it probably was to lay down. From the get-go, Elephant Jokes sounds deliberate; a deliberate go at a punchy front-to-back rock record, one, but also an intentional return to a few of the moves that made those mid-to-late-90s Guided by Voices records (and, to a lesser extent, his fine recent work with the Boston Spaceships) such a ramshackle good time. The Crawling Distance spread 10 tracks over 36 minutes; Elephant Jokes crams 22 of 'em into just over three-quarters of an hour. Just by the numbers, that reduction is huge; since forever, all the best Pollard records have been the ones that get the most songs in, and Elephant Jokes never met an idea it couldn't swiftly abandon in 90 seconds. After a few years largely leaving the fretwork for just about anybody else, several of these songs started with Bob on guitar, with a few taking root with Pollard in an actual studio rather than mucking about at home. The pre-studio GBV records had a feeling of haphazard inception to them, like they were laid down just about anywhere the bottles could be cleared enough to set the recorder down, and in many cases they were. Bob's ""I'll sing, you play"" mode from the last few years has certainly stripped the music of this quality, and it's something Elephant Jokes tries to recreate. Pollard also hasn't sounded as loosely with-it behind the mic on a record since maybe Universal Truths and Cycles. Helps that he's got some weird stuff to say, too; it can be damn near impossible to follow a Pollard freeÂ association through to its conclusion, so Elephant Jokes sports some of his better semi-sequiturs and asides in some time. You owe it to yourself to hear Uncle Bob in his best cornball voice asking, ""Don't you just like college?"" then prodding you about ""seven or eight years"" like he expects a loan repayment, and there's a good deal of playfulness here missing from the straightfaced Crawling Distance. Not sure who's wagging which dog, but with this setup-- actually being around the folks he's recording with, playing a little, chopping it up song-wise, having lots to say, however strange-- Pollard shines. Elephant Jokes isn't just all the makings of a fine Bob Pollard record, it actually is one, carrying on its back a mostly clunker-free batch of tunes that, even when they stall out, always seem to stay on the move. ""Johnny Optimist"" and ""When a Man Walks Away"" are perfectly seasoned power-pop, with Pollard singing the hell out of either, ""Symbols and Heads"" shuffles its way up into similarly hooky but even rockier territory, ""Epic Heads"" has a strong sidelong strut to it, and ""Jimmy"" feels like a continuation of ""A Salty Salute"", and its neon guitar is nearly worthy of the honor. Album highlight ""Stiff Me"" bounces along on warm, wide-open chords, and Pollard's staccato vocal suits the up-and-down verse and stuttery chorus almost perfectly; it's about as fine a song as he's done since GBV ended, and it's got all the markings of a staple. As ever, there's a few numbers that aren't worth skipping back to, and ""Perverted Eyelash"" and ""Blown Out Man"" trudge along at the awkward gate of the sludge rock I wish he'd save for the Circus Devils, and there's not all that much in the same league as ""Stiff Me"" and ""Johnny Optimist"". But the songs slip by so quickly, with a pretty damn high hit-to-miss ratio, it doesn't matter too much that so many of the hits happen to be doubles. Elephant Jokes just has a good feeling about it, as if Pollard really liked this batch, so that's why he deigned to play an instrument on it, maybe, and why he slips a little intro in and closes it out with the very final-sounding ""Architectural Nightmare Man"". It's still a little soft in spots, and not exactly jam-packed with Pollard classics, and for that I'm still partial to the pair of rangy, jangly Boston Spaceships LPs, both of which seem to favor new forms and exciting arrangements rather than the revisitation of a bunch of good old ideas. But, hey, a good idea's still not bad this far on, especially when the guy delivering it is really delivering. As it stands, he is; The Crawling Distance and the spotty Cosmos record with Richard Davies of the Moles notwithstanding, with this and The Planets Are Blasted, Pollard's having his best year on record since pulling the plug on GBV.","Prolific Guided by Voices leader follows his turgid The Crawling Distance with a deliberate, punchy front-to-back rock record.

So what now that Fred Thomas, he of the erstwhile retro-pop outfit Saturday Looks Good to Me, is now recording as part of City Center on the same imprint? City Center doesn't necessarily come off like a true pop record, but where Grouper made a point of sounding fully submerged, City Center never go so far that they can't come up for air. Somewhere between early Paw Tracks' folk abstractions and the recent outpouring of lo-fi dream beat, most of City Center is content to drift in and out of its aqueous surroundings like a buoy. The major chords and ringing ambience of ""Killer Whale"" make for a welcoming entrance point, though Thomas' vocals sound like they've been suspended in some kind of gelatin. If you're looking for a commonality between Coldplay's ""Yellow"", Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's ""So Everyone"", and Animal Collective's ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"", it's the same ringing B-major chord that begins ""Open/House""-- likewise here, amidst punchy synth kicks, it heralds an unusual display of scrutability even while erratic panning, processed steel drums and plate reverb give it distance. You hear echoes of Thomas' past work on ""Gladest"" and ""Summer School"", which hide otherwise sure-footed progressions under bobbing, waterlogged percussion and bell-timbres. Lyrics are, at best, implications and vocal melodies are content to eddy away with no plans of return.Â Ultimately, it's the dynamic between melodic resonance (""Young Diamond"") and found-sound obfuscation (the four minutes of ""You Are a Force"" are pregnant with stay amp hum) that defines a debut that I'd call ""promising,"" if only it gave any sort of indication that it was looking to become a part of some sort of artistic arc, as opposed to a stasis with plenty of breathing room-- even when City Center may appear impenetrable, it's still welcoming. C'mon in, the water's great.","Saturday Looks Good to Me's Fred Thomas creates a record that ranges between early Paw Tracks' folk abstractions and the recent outpouring of lo-fi dream beat.

Braveface,Esser,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54dc0084474cd0c06b8/1:1/w_160/9b29719f.jpg,2009-08-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13290-braveface/,Transgressive,"Modern life can be rubbish. Or so says Esser, an English electro-pop troubadour who sports a flattop that's vintage mod (or exaggerated Jordan Knight). Despite a nonchalant delivery and mostly sunny melodies, he seems down. On opener ""Leaving Town"", he says, ""It feels like I'm drowning, so I threw my mobile in the sea."" On the cartoonish chorus of the title track, he suggests putting on a brave face when the morning comes, and if that little affirmation doesn't see you through the day, attach a brick to your legs and jump into a lake. By track three, he doesn't mince words: ""I've got a problem, it's called living."" With a musical bent towards bouncy melodies and eclectic instrumentation, Ben Esser's debut album of fractured pop is still more muddled than sharp. The dark undercurrents in some of his songs make sense. He's often namechecking 1960s British producer Joe Meek, a skilled yet paranoid artist known for both his tragic demise, a shotgun murder/suicide in 1967, and his ramshackle audio experimentation on hit singles such as ""Telstar"". Esser seems to aspire to create conceptual pop-- not sure if his matching good and bad neck tattoos are commentary on the duality of man or just fashionable ink. But where Meek literally experimented with found sounds and production gear, Esser plays with established techniques and toys to no singular effect. Pop singers certainly don't need to reinvent music production to be gripping, but Esser's debut doesn't strain or stretch creative boundaries or hit that perfect balance between playful and experimental in the same way that contemporaries like Micachu and the Shapes do. ""Leaving Town"" and the title track coast by pleasantly enough, with horns or synth flourishes dressing up run of the mill beats. ""Stop Dancing"" is a Streets-like meditation on getting fucked up in the club, and single ""Headlock"" rolls by with bulbous beats and warped synths before ending in a pool of squeaks and sound effects. While he shows some skill at the kitchen-sink approach to pop experimentation, perfecting it is far from simple. Esser's lyrics, often delivered in a sub-Damon Albarn style, swing towards self-deprication, though they can sound ham-fisted and ring hollow. Take a track like ""I Love You"", where love can be dangerous like a fire in your kitchen-- a grease fire of passion? He even adds that ""love is no excuse for bad art,"" a line no singer should ever serve up with a straight face. ""Satisfied"" sways with staccato piano and stock phrases like, ""You know it's hard to please a woman/ She'll put you on your knees and make you cry,"" and originals like, ""You know a man can never win/ Even if you buy her all the shoes."" Esser needs to tweak the formula a bit, though Cee-Lo has reportedly enlisted him to do production on his solo album, so he'll get plenty of opportunities. Esser has also said artists don't do their best work until three albums in. Time to buckle down, book some studio time, and put on that brave face.","Fractured pop from a flattop-sporting Brit doesn't reach its experimental aspirations.

New Universe,Desolation Wilderness,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58eb1335d7bf1698c13/1:1/w_160/aa2b485f.jpeg,2009-08-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13340-new-universe/,K,"So, then, gauzy: slightly wispy, usually reverb-soaked, never too well defined around the edges, floaty and imprecise like a memory. New Universe, the second LP from Olympia, Wash., quartet Desolation Wilderness and quick turnaround from late 2008's White Light Strobing, is awfully damn gauzy. After two full-lengths, it's clear this is Desolation Wilderness' style, a sound not so much lo-fi as lo-res. Thus far, the band's best work is as a kind of hazy memory trigger; their slowly cascading guitar-led melodies can be imbued with the kind of easygoing beauty that brings to mind slow Super 8 footage of cars rolling by, parks full of trees, sky full of sun, that sort of thing. Yeah, they still evoke flickering memories of stuff like Galaxie 500 and the softer side of shoegaze, too, but there's less of a lead guitar bent this time out, which does help tamp down some of its predecessor's heavy debt. Leader Nicolaas Zwart seems to have put a little more time into crafting songs rather than soundscapes this time out, and whereas White Light felt scrapbooky and occasionally tentative, New Universe sports a newfound confidence and cohesion. Still, though. Is it ever gauzy. And still a tad short in the song department. My biggest complaint about White Light Strobing was that it was too easy to ignore, too breezy, and that it unraveled with concentration. New Universe finds a new way to fall right into the same trap, masking a bunch of jangle-pop songs in far too much jangle. From moment one, as cymbals meet guitars and slowly swell into a loose strum, the music is constantly clouded by the haze. Zwart's lyrics are almost completely obscured by the production-- his own-- and though the band's casual handling of familiar forms can at its best read like the Byrds and the Kinks in a dense fog, songs too often slip by without leaving much in their wake. As with White Light, one certainly senses a wistful, romantic feeling even when the exact message of the song gets lost in the fray; it helps that track titles include ""Strange Cool Girl"" and ""Restless Heart"", I guess. But unlike, say, fellow muzzlepoppers the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, the obscured sonics don't mask any songwriting shortcomings but in fact often amplify them. A few of these tunes feel as though, if you peeled away the film, you'd only find part of a song. Not so with ""San Francisco 2AM"", which starts out chiming and ends up pounding, its melody dizzying like the peak of a long evening out. It's one of just a few moments on New Universe where the song seems perfectly in step with the sound, and it rivals ""Come Over in Your Silver Car"" as the band's best tune. The near-gallop of ""Restless Heart"" and the easygoing, almost Philly soul-tinged ""Satellite Song"" stand out as well, sharp spikes in otherwise fairly staid waters. After White Light, I would've thought Zwart would go the other way with it, throwing a lot more mood into his tunes rather than simply draping atmosphere on top of fairly traditional guitar-pop arrangements. This one-two-three punch near the center of the record-- with the sunsoaked ""Boardwalk Theme"" and the Bradford Coxian ""No Tomorrow (Version)"" trailing shortly behind ""San Francisco""-- does suggest that Zwart can get the balance right when he wants, but there's just not quite enough tune in these tunes, and after one too many unremarkable songs, the production haze casts a pall like an overcast afternoon. All that in mind, I actually like New Universe a little better than its predecessor. It's far less frustrating, for one; White Light Strobing went from one superb little twinkler to one boring-ass overstretched guitar noodle and back too many times to be a satisfying listen, but you can do far worse than to put on New Universe and forget about it until the good parts kick in. Though it's not quite as warm as White Light-- those long instrumental passages did help there-- New Universe's shading is more captivating; Light was a sun-bleached postcard to New Universe's scratchy but comparatively spry filmstrip footage. And Zwart's got a way with melody, though he's got a way to go in developing it, so it's not too terribly hard to see the comfortable but too-easy New Universe as the first step in a potential holding pattern. As it stands right now, though, it's a nice bit of gauzy, gray-hued racket to throw on when you've only got so much attention to give.","Olympia, Wash., project's second full-length is an improvement, as gauzy sonics that are not so much lo-fi as lo-res are used in service of stronger songs.

Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street,Jon Hassell,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51fb1335d7bf1698b12/1:1/w_160/782f2b73.jpg,2009-08-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13247-last-night-the-moon-came-dropping-its-clothes-in-the-street/,ECM,"The jazz trumpeter Jon Hassell's embrace of electronic effects and extensive post-production has positioned him curiously. He is an acknowledged inheritor of Miles Davis and Teo Macero's experiments in electric jazz and studio-aided collage composition, and yet the ambient nature of his work often lands his discs in the new age racks. Hassell studied with Stockhausen and Pandit Pran Nath, played on the first recording of Terry Riley's In C, and collaborated with the likes of La Monte Young, Talking Heads, David Sylvian, and Ry Cooder. He's also the inventor of something he calls Fourth World, ""a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques""-- a phrase that's hard to shake free, in 2009, of associations with Putumayo compilations, or Burning Man. It's difficult to think of another contemporary jazz musician whose reputation encompasses such opposing poles: conceptual rigor on the one hand; easy listening on the other. Hassell's new album, Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street, does in fact make for easy listening-- profoundly warm, immersive, relaxing listening. It's electric-blanket music, isolation-tank music, lucid-dreaming music that moves as assuredly as if by the power of your own suggestion. I've been tempted to call it ""yoga for the mind,"" except that the phrase sounds way too glib, too slack, for music this rigorous. But it's also a puzzle, a non-Euclidean rendering sourced from small-ensemble sessions and recomposed via digital editing. It's as hard to separate out the music's discrete pieces as it is to discern between its structure and sense of drift. Much of the album's pleasures are immediate and visceral. This is as sumptuous as ""ambient"" music gets. The album opens with a glowing song, ""Aurora"", that sounds exactly like its title suggests, with scratchy, glowing drones of uncertain provenance taking on a daybreak shine as Hassell's trumpet rises like a heat mirage in echoing, overlapping lines; there's a faint echo of dub in the bass. ""Time and Place"" is slow, spelunking funk, descending ropey bass lines through chambers where ambient shimmer illuminates melodic figures as lifelike as cave drawings: bluegrass violin, panting organs, and of course Hassell's reverberant horn melodies, which slide around the edges of the song's key signature, highlighting its contours in slippery relief. A dubby pulse echoes the percussive rattle of Hassell's Earthquake Island and, on a more contemporary note, the Moritz von Oswald Trio's Vertical Ascent, which might not be surprising, given that von Oswald has professed his admiration for Hassell's work. The track leads almost seamlessly into ""Abu Gil"", where violin and electric keys blow its modal structure wide open. One of the album's centerpieces, the 13-minute song is grounded in more loping percussion and a pinging bass line that wobbles like a taut clothesline; Hassell's trumpet is refracted through delays and a harmonizer effect, throwing shadows in fourths and fifths as it slinks, catlike, around the changes. You might not notice any of these things on your first or even tenth listen. The measured pacing, especially on the slowly unfolding title track, lulls you into a state that can be described only as hypnotic, as reassuringly resolving string phrases lay out the soft, spongy ground over which Hassell drifts and soars. Like any bird on the wind, Hassell knows how and when to conserve his energies; he lies quiet for long stretches, letting reverb carry his melodies. Often, the line between cause and effect is blurred beyond recognition, leaving only a suggestion of breath lingering in the air. The music's gaseous feel serves to highlight more solid forms, like blocky keyboard chords, that sit like squat, rounded ruins poking through the forest canopy. The title comes from a poem by the 13th century Persian Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi: ""Last night the moon came dropping its clothes in the street/ I took it as a sign to start singing,/ Falling up into the bowl of sky."" Some 700 years later, it proves to have been an exceptionally prescient description of Hassell's own malleable approach, melting geometrical structures with blur and bent pitches, turning breath to wind and cheating gravity with every updraft. But if part of the music's pleasure is its liquid physicality, an equal measure derives from its conceptual base. Formally, it's hard to say exactly what to call this stuff: jazz? Electro-acoustic improv? Ambient dub? All those terms apply in some measure. Rather than a record of single performances, the album is stitched together from fragments of both studio sessions and live recordings-- although ""stitched"" is an inexact metaphor for joints this smeared and seamless. As Hassell describes it in his liner notes, ""The music presented here is a montage of the last years of concerts and the changing cast of the group I call Maarifa Street-- all musicians who have contributed their personalities-- the way an actor does to a film-- to this living, morphing process that occasionally gets set down as a 'record.'"" The slippage in his hyphenated phrases approaches the horizontal rush of the record itself, ideas overlapping, subjects blurring, dependent clauses assuming a commanding role. His touring group Maarifa Street is here a core ensemble including Peter Freeman (bass, guitar, percussion), Jan Bang (live sampling), Rick Cox (guitar), Jamie Muhoberac (keyboard), Kheir-Eddine M'Kachiche (violin), Dino J.A. Deane (live sampling), Eivind Aarset (guitar), Helge Norbakken (drums), and Steve Shehan (percussion), with a few other players occasionally rotating in for a single track. The album's sleevenotes also credit Thomas Newman and Rick Cox for the title track's repeated string phrases, Eivind Aarset for ""a beautiful loop"" in ""Blue Period"" and ambient dub producer Pole for a sample used in an unspecified track. (Bringing things full circle, the composer Miles Evans-- son of Miles Davis' collaborator Gil Evans-- is credited ""for the atmospherics"" in ""Abu Gil"".) That might look like a lot of names in a row, but I think they bear repeating, for Hassell clearly means to impress upon us that this is a collective effort. Even Arnaud Mercier and his live-sampling software, Cognition, get a mention-- suggesting the degree to which the album's creation was not only a collaborative process, but one where the easy assumptions about chops and genius don't apply. Wrapping your mind around this music is about as easy as grabbing a fistful of river, but that's precisely what makes it so rewarding.","This acknowledged inheritor of Miles Davis and Teo Macero's experiments in electric jazz and studio-aided collage composition creates a stunning new LP.

See Mystery Lights,YACHT,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5849d034d5c69bf32f7/1:1/w_160/fbeddfc0.jpg,2009-08-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13334-see-mystery-lights/,DFA,"Jona Bechtolt-- founding member of YACHT, former member of the Blow-- is a huge talent, something that may not have been readily apparent on any of his three previous LPs. Those albums, created largely as solo endeavors, will not have prepared listeners for See Mystery Lights. Now an official partnership between Bechtolt and Claire L. Evans, who performed on several songs on 2007's I Believe In You, Your Magic Is Real, YACHT finally feel like a full-fledged band with direction and vision, particularly given the added weight (or rather, levity) of Evans' influence. The songs on See Mystery Lights-- from the bouncy, burbling you-can't-take-it-with-you screed ""The Afterlife"" (which plays like a less spastic companion piece to the Mae Shi's ""Run to Your Grave"") to the roller rink-ready vocoder vocals of ""I'm In Love With a Ripper""-- represent YACHT at their most poppy. It's a collection of stone jams that finds the band finally as hellbent on experimenting and expanding the boundaries of its sonic scope as it is on having fun. Built on electronic foundations-- laser effects, skittering computerized beats, and spacey synth lines (or guitar riffs that have been tuned or distorted to sound like synths)-- these new songs are giddy with creative freedom while remaining tethered in service of their melodies. The vocal melodies are bright and buoyant, but delivered (by either band member, or in unison) in a chanted, oftentimes detached monotone that plays up the repetitive lyrics' mantra-like feel and adds a welcome undercurrent of slacker cool to their otherwise sugary optimism. See Mystery Lights also marks the first time that YACHT are recording for DFA. Normally a label-change wouldn't be notable, as it is usually less an indicator of artistic choices than it is of financial or business ones, but moving to a label with such a distinctive aesthetic may be enough for many to reconsider their work. YACHT themselves created the track ""Summer Song"" as an homage to LCD Soundsystem, and LCD/DFA leader James Murphy liked it enough to release it on his label. It's no wonder that Murphy was smitten; the track, which also appears on the full-length, echoes the deadpan vocal delivery and burbling 80s krautrock synths of his own band, as well as cowbell-and-handclap percussion ripped from the Rapture's ""House of Jealous Lovers"", one of DFA's biggest singles. Even other tracks on the collection-- ones that weren't written specifically in homage to Murphy-- can't help but sound influenced by him. Case in point: ""We Have All We've Ever Wanted"", with its minimalist dance beat, heavy bass, and Bechtolt's dry, talky delivery, recalls ""Losing My Edge"", albeit with a lighthearted, anthemic chorus. Still, while YACHT clearly share influences with Murphy's gang (Eno, Ferry, Neu!, ESG, etc.), their positive, futuristic jams actually sound most closely related to Tom Tom Club. Perhaps that's because, like Tom Tom Club's first self-titled album, which was recorded in Barbados, See Mystery Lights was recorded in a sunny, faraway locale-- in this case, far from the band's native rainy Portland, Oregon, in Marfa, Texas. The vibe of the album is relaxed and sun-soaked-- especially ""Psychic City (Voodoo City)"", which features an elastic groove built on a dubby, reggae-ish keyboard melody inspired by the bassline of Althea and Donna's ""Uptown Top Ranking"". Regardless of influence or intent, however, See Mystery Lights is a triumph. It's a feel-good album for an era that could use a little happiness, a sweaty collection of heady, hedonistic tunes just in time for the hottest days of the year. And the best part is that one spin of this wily, sunny disc will be able to transport you back to summer vacation any day of the year.","__NOTE: Record and track reviews return next week.

Apple's Acre,Nurses,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52f5e6ef95969320a44/1:1/w_160/f97dd999.jpg,2009-08-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13263-apples-acre/,Dead Oceans,"Aaron Chapman and John Bowers, friends since middle school, have moved from Idaho to California to Chicago to (finally) Portland, Oregon, and they've dragged their psych-rock project, Nurses, with them. But they've never seemed to fully unpack until now. Sure, they self-released a debut in 2007 that was born of the San Diego sunshine, but it took verdant Portland to give Nurses the rain they really needed to grow. Since arriving they've taken on a third member, percussionist James Mitchell, and hunkered down in an old Victorian house to self-record a much higher profile sophomore release. And as such, Apple's Acre sounds homemade in the best possible way. It is a quality that speaks to not only the intimacy of the recording, but also the confidence and comfort that Nurses now have in their delicately shambolic sound. (Not to mention the plain fact that something can't be homemade unless you actually have a home to make it in-- and Nurses now do.) Like the shaggy younger sibling of Animal Collective or Grizzly Bear on a tight budget, Nurses marry dreamy harmonies to spare arrangements of slightly out-of-tune pianos, carnival organs, and basic percussion from a lone snare or tambourine. The songs have a real sonic sprawl due to the space within the airy voices-- they manage to sound cohesive without sounding dense-- and the ticking, whirring electronic effects that resonate in the background mysteriously. With a reedy, acrobatic vocal timbre that can recall Jeff Mangum, Muse's Matt Bellamy, or Win Butler all in the span of one song, Chapman adds a messy, primal pulse to the ethereal, otherworldly arrangements. His not-quite-vulgar but definitely earthy delivery keeps these haunting tracks from living entirely in a heady realm of glimmering pianos and off-kilter rhythms, anchoring the vaporous harmonies with his slightly incongruous red-blooded delivery. The band rightly kicks off Apple's Acre with ""Technicolor"", a track that not only acts as an introduction to Nurses' ramshackle combination of the sweet and the hard, but also, with its title, announces their big, bright musical ambition. With pianos that sound like the gentle tinkling of a crystal chandelier layered atop reverberating vocals and heavily galloping percussion, the track constantly threatens to blossom into a psychedelic anthem, but muffled by an echoey effect, it remains subtly muted. Though there are bold color strokes in many of their songs-- the chirpy whistling on ""Caterpillar Playground"", the vintage-inspired ""I Only Want to Be With You""-like vocal melody of the title track, the swirling stadium- or carousel-worthy organs of ""Bright Ideas""-- most of the collection is painted with a more subdued palette of watercolors. ""Lita"", for instance, tames its firm, percussive stomp with lush vocals, a repetitive melody, and ghostly electronic effects. The toll that the band's itinerant wanderings had on the duo is audible in Apple's Acre's lyrics. With lines about trying to get back home (on ""Technicolor"") or the differences between a house and a home (on ""Lita""), you can hear the two drifters yearning to put down roots. But that can be attributed to the fact that many of these songs were written years ago, during the band's travels, and only recently recorded in their Portland attic-cum-studio. And so, in juxtaposing those lyrics against their lysergic harmonies and lovely, strange piano twinkles, both of which feel lived in, you can hear that those desires for permanence have been answered. For the time being at least, Nurses have found a home, and they sound good there because, as we know, there's no place like it.","After several years of wandering, harmony-happy psych-rockers Nurses put down roots in Portland and made an album that sounds homemade in the best way.

Kabukimono,Rainbow Arabia,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5919d034d5c69bf331b/1:1/w_160/12f5c3c8.jpg,2009-08-04 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13346-kabukimono/,Manimal Vinyl,"Remember the clip for Rainbow Arabia's ""Omar K"", the one where frontwoman Tiffany Preston transforms into a be-fanged vision of Lemmy Kilmister and trashes a Whole Foods with a murderous, mustachioed grade-schooler? Daniel Preston (Tiffany's husband, and the other half of the L.A.-based global fusion outfit) plays the shopkeep who becomes increasingly frustrated with the bizarre antics of these grocery-terrorists (from the hatcheting of a female customer to just a general disregard for produce), only to finally give in when the pair throw a rager in the booze aisle. All is forgiven (I think), but I couldn't help but feel for the poor guy: I happen to feel the exact same way about Rainbow Arabia itself. The aimless rambunction is fine for a while, but nothing really gets off the ground unless the groove is firmly in place. The fact that Kabukimono has such a high batting average doesn't really have much to do with freshness: out of the seven tracks presented here, two of them are remixes of year-old songs found on the band's debut EP Basta, leaving a scant 17 minutes of new music to explore. It's kind of a shame that the remixes are such duds, because some of the band's songs could benefit from a little cleverly balanced outsider influence. You spend a lot of the time admiring the freeform liveliness and nifty instrumentation rather than the tunes themselves, so when a little restraint is exercised, you find yourself, well, frustrated that it isn't exercised more often. Still, there's a lot of charm in Kabukimono's amateur feel. Where ""Haunted Hall"" feels a little half-baked, ""I Know I See I Love I Go"" imports the same eerie trepidation and offers it some shape, giving way to the perfect soundtrack to a chase through the tangled alleyways of Algiers. Much of Kabukimono is a little seedy and a little dangerous in that way, which is pretty refreshing coming from a band that tries on so many inherently cheerful global stylings. Maybe the blithe Congotronic opener ""Holiday in Congo"" (a horrifying situation in a certain context) isn't as warmly innocent as it sounds, now grafted into a potentially tongue-in-cheek affair that suggests the Prestons are slyer than we initially assumed. It's a good look. And yes, the album is fun to bop around to, so maybe it's nitpicky to complain that none of the songs really stick. But when you're throwing us ideas this playful and engaging, it's hard not to expect a little more. ""Harlem Sunrise"" is most certainly the album highlight, but also provides an essential insight into why some of these tracks work and why some don't: The island vibe and cool tin drums are bouncy and affable, but it's that great, plainly-stated guitar line that provides a wonderful juxtaposition between inner-city melancholy and malaise and windsurfing with a daiquiri in your hand. ""Harlem"" offers some much need intricacy for a band whose sound too often flirts with greenhornism, and proves that there's room for real expanse in the near future (oh, and maybe more than five new songs next time around).","On the heels of their 2008 Basta EP comes another short record from the L.A.-based global fusion duo, which includes remixes and new songs.

It Feels So Good When I Stop,Joe Pernice,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58f9d034d5c69bf3316/1:1/w_160/76bd4094.jpg,2009-08-04 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13345-it-feels-so-good-when-i-stop/,Ashmont,"Joe Pernice is an immensely talented songwriter, but he's not necessarily one of our most literary, at least not as the word is most commonly invoked. Unlike writers such as Ray Davies or Elvis Costello, Pernice isn't known for his tricky wordplay, tight character studies, or flights of fancy. Rather, as an erstwhile solo artist and the leader of the Scud Mountain Boys, Chappaquiddick Skyline, and, most prominently, the Pernice Brothers, he's focused on the big picture: the swoon of strings, the subtle interplay of chiming guitars, hook-enhancing harmonies, the whole slightly out-of-time chamber-pop package. Lyrics included, of course, but rarely are they specifically so clever or incisive to call undue attention to themselves. That's a tad ironic, since Pernice, unlike 99% of his peers, actually holds an MFA in creative writing from U Mass, but up until now one of the few documents of his fiction was his 2003 33 1/3 novellaÂ inspired by the Smiths' Meat Is Murder. Now comes It Feels So Good When I Stop, Pernice's debut novel, and it, too, features its fair share of autobiographical elements, an aspect which Pernice has cannily amplified by recording a companion ""novel soundtrack"" to the book containing several covers of songs referenced therein. It's a smart way for a songwriter-turned-novelist to break the fourth wall without distracting from his prose, complementing the story (some snippets of which, as read by Pernice, appear interspersed through the disc) while emphasizing his parallel musical background and prowess. To that end, the covers here are particularly diverse, ranging from Sebadoh and Plush to Tom T. Hall and Todd Rundgren. Pernice's instinct for assembling the whole package comes in handy, too-- not just in the music's connection to the novel but how Pernice takes this eclectic slate of source material and fits it to his established melodic mÃ©tier. Del Shannon's ""I Go to Pieces"", for example, undeniably reflects its 1960s rock'n'roll origins, but Pernice polishes it up and contemporizes it enough that it wouldn't sound particularly out of place on one of his more conventional records. The same goes for Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham's ""I'm Your Puppet"", a hit for James & Bobby Purify and here a laid-back jangle-pop breeze. On the indie rock tip, the jagged guitar lead of Pernice's wistful rendition of Sebadoh's ""Soul and Fire"" is the only nod to the skuzzier origins of the original. Elsewhere Sammy Johns' smooth 1975 hit ""Chevy Van"" and Tom T. Hall's malleable new standard ""That's How I Got to Memphis"" are reminders that Pernice's career began in alt-country, while the Dream Syndicate's ""Tell Me When It's Over"" reminds us of the college rock and punk roots that made so many alt-country acts ""alt"" to begin with.Â ""Black Smoke (No Pope)"" hones closest to the novel, credited as it is to the Young Accuser, the name of the band featuring Pernice's page-bound protagonist. It's an easy-going instrumental that, in an instance of life-imitating-art-imitating-life, is getting its own separate 7"" release (as a B-side) via Sub Pop, the label that gave Pernice his first break back in the Scud Mountain Boys' days. (Sub Pop calls it ""the non-fiction version"" of a fictional single). It bears mentioning that It Feels So Good When I Stop, the book-- which begins with a quote from Elvis Costello's King of America-era ""Our Little Angel""-- also references such acts as the Pogues, the Clash, Naked Raygun, and the Chills (among many, many others), bands that might have pushed Pernice further outside his comfort zone. Even if as usual said comfort zone is nothing to complain about, Pernice's way with a pretty tune is pretty well documented. If It Feels So Good When I Stop expands his abilities as a writer, it'd be at least interesting to hear a record of his that does the same for his skills as a musician.","Following a novella inspired by the Smiths, the singer-songwriter pens his first novel-- and releases an accompanying soundtrack.

Infinite Light,Lightning Dust,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5545e6ef95969320a9b/1:1/w_160/fce84a2d.jpg,2009-08-04 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13295-infinite-light/,Jagjaguwar,"Amber Webber's broken-warbled vibrato is thick and sour-sweet like buttermilk, wobbly as a warped record, bumpy as the soft-hard ridges of a curved spine. The Vancouver singer/multi-instrumentalist who sidelines as Lightning Dust with fellow Black Mountaineer Joshua Wells, lends single-slug words ""hand"" and ""sea"" a dozen extra syllables and a line like ""this city is in a panic"" a waving-or-drowning inscrutability. Throughout Lightning Dust's second LP, Infinite Light, Webber's on the verge of tears-- or laughter, depending on how her voice finds you-- and her raw emotion makes for one of the fiercest, most stirring vocal performances of any release this year. But I don't want to sell Infinite Light as an alt-""American Idol"" vocal exhibition-- all weird drama, no script. Webber's fever and shy fervor is precisely suited to the album's thematic conceit: the anxiety and streaky joy of new love, which unfolds in a loose narrative you can trace from ""I Knew""'s itchy iterations of lust, to the morning-after calm of ""Waiting on the Sun to Rise"", to ""Take It Home""'s melancholy crossroads straddle. And unlike the duo's 2007 self-titled debut, which too often banked on the atmosphere wafting off Well's pulsed organ tones, these songs start with basic pop templates and expand on them with inventive, genre-exploding arrangements. Sure, Webber and Wells make the predictable Cali-canyon and psychedelic space moves you'd expect from people who've worked closely with Stephen McBean, but they call up a range of references-- Krautrock, girl group, piano man, and source du jour, Fleetwood Mac. According to the players, the five-day loan of a Steinway grand piano inspired this mostly keyboard-driven clutch of spontaneous-sounding tunes. Blues boogie ""The Times"" finds its capital letter emphasis in the piano's capacity for booming, bounding chords, and ""Antonia Jane"" deploys the instrument in rolling, arpeggiated waves for the opposite reason-- its knack for sensitive conversational counterpoint. First single and should-be summer mixtape staple ""I Knew"", however, owes its unexpected electricity to the collision of drum machine, quicksilver organ, dusty guitar, and molasses-mouth vocals, its jittery propulsion reminiscent of Black Mountain's dark odyssey ""No Hits"". And ""Wondering What Everyone Knows"", a kind of homage to paranoid doomed-love ballads once emoted by Lesley Gore and Nancy Sinatra, finds delicious melodrama in a wall of histrionic string swells and lumbering drum fills. ""Never Seen""'s foggy synthesizers, on the other hand, produce the most characteristic Lightning Dust sound (if such a thing exists among folks this enamored of so many different ones) of trippy hippie mysticism. I could easily rustle up praise for every track on the album; notwithstanding a title that says too much weed at best and religious cult at worst, Infinite Light is solid. And its overall quality owes more than a small debt to the fact that Webber and Wells have the good taste and modesty to keep it at 10 songs (supporting my long-held conviction, anyway, that if rock bands want to pack more than 10 tracks or 40 minutes of material on an LP, they should have to petition a court first). That said, if these guys happen to have any more casually gorgeous songs like these just lying around, I'd love to hear them.","The Black Mountain members' latest LP starts with basic pop templates and expands on them with inventive, genre-exploding arrangements.

Hospice,The Antlers,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e45e6ef95969320993/1:1/w_160/c476ec8f.jpeg,2009-08-04 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/,Frenchkiss,"Who could've guessed that SNMNMNM were ahead of the curve? In 2009, you kind of need to know some C++ just to talk about bands. The trend began in dreamy California, which gave us the skuzzy-sweet Nodzzz and Wavves, and then migrated as far as Nebraska (UUVVWWZ) and Glasgow (Dananananaykroyd). Meanwhile, in serious Brooklyn, the Antlers were quietly working on a coincidental antithesis to this fad. Hospice answers silliness with solemnity, jitters with nerve. Their band name simply describes their music: a delicately branching instrument of force. Not that the Antlers are startlingly original-- they're just swinging for the bleachers at a time when it seems fashionable to bunt, or put your forehead on the bat and spin until you get dizzy. Their widescreen sentimentality comes with an equally familiar back-story. You remember the Bon Iver beat:Â Sad, bearded dude emerges from self-imposed exile with batch of urgently intimate songs; recruits band; self-releases album that earns surprise web-buzz and gets picked up by venerable indie label.Â Well, the Antlers used to be the solo project of Peter Silberman, who wrote Hospice while emerging from a period of ""social isolation."" During the bedroom recording process, two guest musicians (drummer Michael Lerner and multi-instrumentalist Darby Cicci) became permanent members. They self-released Hospice in March, and Frenchkiss picked it up after web- and NPR-praise helped sell out its first pressing. The Antlers' skyscraping blend of the ambient and the anthemic is a far cry from Bon Iver's subtle folksiness, but Silberman and Justin Vernon emerged from their traumas seeming equally scoured and eager to reconnect. Hospice is bereft of irony and cynicism, as befits a rather ghastly narrative that feels, perhaps deceptively, autobiographical. Centered around a relationship with a terminally ill child, and evocatively spun from eerie hospital scenery, snippets of conversations with doctors, terrifying dreams, and the periodic intrusions of Sylvia Plath, it becomes a broad meditation on guilt, duty, mortality, and hope in the face of hopelessness. The emotional payload, while artfully couched, is fervent and bleeding. Silberman's affecting earnestness, not to mention his sweet voice, allows him to pull off lines like, ""All the while I know we're fucked/ And not getting un-fucked soon,"" while sounding more prayerful than cynical. Given the bluster of the music and its fixation on death and illness (not to mention Silberman's creaky diction and fluttery falsetto), it's impossible not to be reminded of Arcade Fire's Funeral. You could even fix Hospice's precedent a bit earlier-- its starry atmosphere and bludgeoning tenderness evoke Cursive's Domestica with a pop-noise sheen. Like these groups, the Antlers plumb that elusive place where the personally specific becomes universal. They achieve this by keeping the human frailty of the singer intact while inflating his feelings to mythological proportions. You can imagine Silberman, in his isolation, growing world-sized and full; how the emotional forces he grappled with came to seem meteorological. This sense of the boundary between self and world-at-large collapsing permeates Hospice. The lyrics cover shades of emotion from despairing persistence (""Kettering"") to desperate joy (the 21st-birthday fantasia ""Bear"");Â the music tells the same story, throughÂ quicksilver currents of tension and tranquility. ""Sylvia"" alternates between acute frailty and Queen-caliber bravado, guided by the sort of gnarled electronic line the Antlers love (see also the monotonous buzz whipping around the corners of chipper guitar chords on ""Two""). But whatâs really great is how these modulations of weight are integrated into an album-long sweep, with crescendos nested inside decrescendos, coiling surges inside lengthy unwinding passages.

KesÃ¤maan Lapset,Es,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58dea9e61561daa517b/1:1/w_160/a5f3d93d.jpg,2009-08-03 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13349-kesamaan-lapset/,Fonal,"Sami SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ has helped orchestrate one of the most fruitful, stylistically consistent labels of the decade. Finnish experimental/folk label Fonal harks back to days when an album's label stamp was indicative of sound (and Fonal's exquisite digipaks also provide reason to trudge to the record store). Amidst this, SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ has quietly claimed one of the best records in the Fonal catalogue as his own: Es' 2005 2xCDÂ Sateenkaarisuudelma stands as a monument of kaleidoscopic drone and rabbit-eared chant. SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤'s KesÃ¤maan Lapset dials down Sateenkaarisuudelma's sprawl while exploring increasingly electronic soundworlds. It sometimes seems SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ hasn't yet carved out his own niche among the Fonal roster: Es records don't contain Kemialliset Ystavat's aggressive art foibles, Islaja's doom-y vocals, or Kiila's ever-buried songcraft. SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ does have a fine sense of construct, however: KesÃ¤maan Lapset revolves around its title track, a 21-minute carousel of distorted voice, bold, horn-stained orchestration, and soft-palate fadeout. The final enveloping minutes-- heavenly choirs, champagne electronics, decaying keyboards-- are as blissfully opulent as anything a Fonal artist has laid to tape. ""KesÃ¤maan Lapset"" has such a pull to it that the remainder of KesÃ¤maan Lapset often seems slight in comparison. This despite SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤'s sound-heavy compositions, the product of (likely) constant tinkering (visit Es' website and click ""gear"" for a step-by-step design process of a string-plucking mechanism built using a turntable). SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ saturates his tapes until they drip honey, and the result is not just beauty but a lot of beauty. The overloaded organ sendoff of ""Haamut Sun SydÃ¤mestÃ¤"" sounds like the chapel blew an amplifier tube; ""Ennen Oli Huonommin"" fills the opening five minutes of the album with randomized digital patter and way-off sighs. ""KesÃ¤ Ja HymyilevÃ¤t Huulet"" sees SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ adopting a weird sing-speak over a nervous keyboard that, 30 years and a continent away, might've belonged to Red Krayola. Like all pretty experimental music that either contains few vocals or contains vocals we can't understand, it's easy to read religion into Es' compositions (an observation that has been made more generally about the Fonal label). They seem peaceful, reverent, and mysterious. And while it's certainly not fair to ascribe any specific religious intent to SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤, this is part of the appeal: no one should listen to KesÃ¤maan Lapset to contemplate tires or coffee or closet storage. The album's artwork strongly suggests childhood nostalgia, but KesÃ¤maan Lapset offers plenty of fuel for the navel-gazing subject matter of your choice. Five albums in, this is hardly a surprise. KesÃ¤maan Lapset is neither as wildly ambitious nor as carefully orchestrated as Sateenkaarisuudelma (the 11 minutes of bright-organ drone that comprise ""SÃ¤teet Sun Sielusta"" are as prettily, gorgeously stale as Es gets), but it does delve more heartily into chance-y electronics. More importantly, SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ has managed a warm, open composition cycle that is forgiving of his dozing and kind to his epics; so much so that it allows us to function the same way.","Fonal bossÂ Sami SÃ¤npÃ¤kkilÃ¤ follows his quietly wonderful 2xCDÂ Sateenkaarisuudelma with another sprawling electronic soundworld.

Music For Falling From Trees,Peter Broderick,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54c9d034d5c69bf328c/1:1/w_160/5ff9a1ba.jpeg,2009-08-03 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13289-music-for-falling-from-trees/,Western VinylErased Tapes,"Still in his early twenties, Peter Broderick has the CV of a middle-aged journeyman. He's played a variety of stringed instruments for, like, every indie band in the Pacific Northwest. He moved to Copenhagen for a live stint with some mad Danes, Efterklang, and played on Library Tapes' A Summer Beneath the Trees. Amid all of this collaboration, he's eked out several of his own albums, ranging in style from post-classical (Float) to folk (Home). His catalog is consistently enjoyable and well-played, but we're still waiting for him to produce a major work. This isn't it, but it has a good excuse: Music For Falling From Trees is a score for a modern dance by Adrienne Hart, and standalone scores tend to be faintly anemic. It's like someone offering you half of a sandwich, then giving you just the bread. (There are some self-sufficient exceptions, like JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson's EnglabÃ¶rn, which Music For Falling From Trees resembles.) Broderick's score is surpassingly lovely, but it doesn't synthesize his influences into a unique voice-- ""Patient Observation"" is a dead-ringer for Kronos Quartet Performs Philip Glass, with a roundelay of longing strings conveying a lonely, enigmatic grandeur. ""Electroconvulsive Shock"", with its taut two-tone foundation, suggests the same affinity, and elsewhere, you'll hear unreconstructed echoes of Max Richter, Elodie Lauten, and many other composers of a post-minimal bent. Of course, trying on different voices is exactly what a musician Broderick's age should be doing. He wears them well, and will surely come into his own once he stops ticking items off of a to-do list and develops more focus. His development seems stunted only because of his prodigious output, which makes a brief career feel much longer than it is. That said, fans of plain-old pretty (myself included) will get plenty of spins out of Music For Falling From Trees. It's musical air-freshener at worst, and inspired homage at best. The dance's themes of infirmity and redemption are writ large in the song titles, but it's Broderick's technique, not the narrative, that captivates. What you notice is the control of his pacing on ""An Introduction to the Patient"", the implacability with which lines of force gather on ""Pill Induced Slumber"", the liquid cadence of ""The Path to Recovery"". And standout track ""The Dream"" offers a hint as to what might well become Broderick's mature style-- heavenly drones spill into a light-footed dance for piano and pizzicato strings. It's a crystal-clear expression of an impulse that flits through most of Broderick's music, where he condenses folksy, jubilant themes out of masses of understated tone. It's exciting to hear his talent develop in something like real-time (given the fast pace of his output), as he finds his way toward a breakthrough that seems tantalizingly close at hand.","Having worked with Efterklang, Library Tapes, and others, in addition to recording his own music, the young composer turns his attention to a dance score.

Love and Curses,Reigning Sound,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55613d1975652138f12/1:1/w_160/06ebc356.jpeg,2009-08-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13297-love-and-curses/,In the Red,"One of Memphis' most popular local celebrities during the 1960s was television personalityÂ Watson Davis, who donned death-pallor make-up, exaggerated fangs, and a dapper Dracula tux to become Sivad. He cracked corny jokes and introduced cornier monster movies on WHBQ-TV's ""Fantastic Features"" and even recorded a few novelty hits, including the stiffly swinging ""Sivad Buries Rock and Roll"". Just a few years later, however, Davis was off television and mostly forgotten, working as a mechanic in rural Arkansas. Yet Sivad remains a pop-cultural touchstone for Mid-Southerners of a certain age, including Greg Cartwright of the Oblivians and Reigning Sound, who chose Sivad's motto as the title as the Sound's long-awaited fourth studio album, Love and Curses. That reference works as a grim reminder of the status of so many of Cartwright's influences, who prospered decades ago but are less than footnotes today, inspiring crate-digging musicians but rarely reaching the large audiences they once commanded. If Sivad buried rock'n'roll, Cartwright digs it up under torchlight in the dead of a moonless night, unearthing outer-boroughs girl-group sounds, deep-South R&B rhythms, and universal garage-rock skuzz. It's no coincidence that the only cover on Love and Curses is an obscure single called ""Stick Up for Me"" by the Glass Sun. Does anyone remember them? Reigning Sound do, and the song's organ-drenched boogie momentum and shouted call-and-response are simultaneously nostalgic and immediate. Coming across as the period's most diligent archivists, Reigning Sound have over the past few years backed former Shangri-La Mary Weiss in the studio and on tour and worked with Muscle Shoals legends Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, and Cartwright was briefly a member of Michigan garage rock lifers the Detroit Cobras. Love and Curses sounds as much a product of the present as of the past, and the new songs attack with goblin force but vampire sophistication, thanks to another new line-up. The rhythm section of drummer Lance Wille and bass player David Wayne Gay (formerly of Freakwater) add muscle and agility to the stomping ""If I Can't Come Back"" and ""Dangerous Game"", while Dave Amels lays down sweeping organ riffs on ""Something to Hold Onto"" and ""Broken Things"". The album never quite sounds as life-or-death urgent as 2004's Too Much Guitar, but that album lived up to its name by burying Cartwright alive. Love and Curses brings his vocals back to the forefront, although he still sings like he's being chased by some unknown specter. In addition to his open-wound rasp-- few singers today can convey grievous pain so easily-- he also has an eye for the cruelties and ironies of romance, which slice through every track. On the stand-out ""Debris"", he sings about a lover's heart turning to stone and his own turning to rubble, straining his voice like he has to cover his eyes but can't look away. Love can be horrifying, hilarious, gory, and deeply disturbing, so why not have a horror host like Sivad presiding over the chills, creeps, and scares?","Memphis garage-rock fixture Greg Cartwright continues to unearth intriguing corners of 1950s and 60s rock and pop.

The Ruminant Band,Fruit Bats,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58c9d034d5c69bf330c/1:1/w_160/29f3c8ce.jpg,2009-08-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13350-the-ruminant-band/,Sub Pop,"Sitting on Sub Pop since the label's early-oughts soft-rock land grab (think Postal Service, the Shins, Iron & Wine), Eric Johnson's Fruit Bats have chilled in those long shadows since 2002's Mouthfuls. Part of the reason of late is Johnson's own doing; the outfit has been dormant since 2005's breezy Laurel Canyon paean Spelled in Bones. Johnson himself has been plenty busy, though, between becoming the first non-Albuquerquean to play with Mercer & co., and sitting in with American Beauty acolytes and fellow Sup Popians Vetiver. As for the latest release: The word ""ruminant"" applies to cows making cud as well as brains making decisions, and this effort, the one he's had the most time to chew on, emerges unsurprisingly as the fullest-sounding, and (by a hair over Bones) the best thing he's done yet. Listen to any of Johnson's albums for more than a track or two, and you get the sense that he's not really one for drastic change; instead, he's capable of flexing within the rustic confines of his chosen vibe. His ear for detail here is sharper than ever: The bittersweet and nostalgic ""Singing Joy to the World"" bookends an imaginary relationship between Three Dog Night's titular tune sung at a fairground performance and a girl dancing to Prince's ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" at a bar. But he's able to bliss out, too-- ""Flamingo"" is post-tweaked with crackle and echo to sound like a Sun Records doo-wop pastiche, Johnson closing the record in giddy falsetto: ""Everything is gonna be just fine."" That's a nice way to describe Ruminant, and Johnson's work more generally: ""just fine."" That's not damnation via faint praise-- the record is ""fine,"" as in an indication of precision and elegance. As always, Johnson's gift for grab is subtle but effective. In a 2005 interview with Popmatters, he expressed a fondness for Led Zeppelin III, and though it took a while, sure enough, subtle variations on the forceful front-porch strum, stout drums of the borderline jammy ""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"" underscores opener ""Primitive Man"", followed by the title track, which while namedropping a ""blue-eyed Merle"", packs enough pristine overdubs to even suggest II's ""Ramble On"" or box set bonus ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"". The tossed-off saloon stomper ""The Hobo Girl"": yup, Physical Graffiti's ""Boogie With Stu"". Johnson also finds a way to make AM Gold fresh again by filtering his own spirit through a cast of characters. One offers roadside proverbs (""You'll always eat bread if you always have seeds to sow""), another relates a bluesy origin myth built on bringing cold weather wherever he travels, and another loves hearing about your dreams when he wakes up. For what it's worth, the album fits exceedingly well between Wilco (The Album) and Richard Swift's The Atlantic Ocean: ""My Unusual Friend"" fits breezy guitars over a staccato piano rhythm, and ""Being on Our Own"" is sympathetic country-pop. All this means that Fruit Bats, like their contemporaries, could unfortunately be passed over due to sheer familiarity. That'd be a shame, because The Ruminant Band only gets more rewarding as it settles in.","Sub Pop veteran Eric Johnson makesÂ AM Gold fresh again by filtering his own spirit through a cast of characters.

No One's First and You're Next,Modest Mouse,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58ab1335d7bf1698c0b/1:1/w_160/ca89ade8.jpg,2009-08-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13348-no-ones-first-and-youre-next/,Epic,"A decade ago, the idea that Modest Mouse would have the #1 album in the U.S. seemed about as unlikely as a liberal African-American president. But sure enough, We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank debuted strong back in 2007, and the initial shock turned first into living-in-the-future optimism and then into holy-shit-what-do-we-do-now jitters. Would Isaac Brock, you know, blink? Would Modest Mouse's follow-up be a Best Buy exclusive? Would their next single end up on a summer blockbuster soundtrack? (Do they even make soundtracks for summer blockbusters anymore?) But the band's gradual acceptance via radio, commercials, and ""American Idol"" reveals the porousness of the 2000s mainstream rather than Brock's own career ambitions. Over six albums in 12 years, he has thought up countless metaphors to express the same cosmic anomie, and if his recent songs have displayed a sense of hopefulness and maybe even contentment, it sounds both more precarious and more intense following so many years of growling angst. It seems he can't be anything other than his usual weird self, as this new EP suggests. No One's First and You're Next is not a real follow-up to We Were Dead. It collects eight songs dating as far back as 2005's Good News for People Who Love Bad News, all of which have been previously released in one form or another: some A- and B-sides from earlier this year, along with album outtakes like ""King Rat"", which is famous for having a video directed by Heath Ledger. A remora to the previous album's shark, No One's First recalls 1999's Building Nothing Out of Something and 2001's Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks, both of which assembled leftovers into stand-alone statements that sound as cohesive as the material that fed them. Building in particular stands as one of the band's best releases of any length. It's neither surprising nor especially troubling that No One's First sounds scattershot compared to those two releases. As the band has grown more popular, it has mutated considerably over the last two albums, making forays into more accessible pop as well as into stranger Dixieland territory and collaborating with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and former Smith Johnny Marr (both of whom appear here). So this EP has a lot of ground to cover, and does a decent job of portraying a band that can stretch itself from epic guitar workouts like ""Whale Song"" to straightforward singles like ""Satellite Skin"" to warped brass-band reimaginings like ""Perpetual Motion Machine"". That makes No One's First-- all shortcomings aside-- an intriguing listen, one that presents Modest Mouse's defining characteristics intact even as it plays up new ones. ""Perpetual Motion Machine"" invites the Dirty Dozen Brass Band back for another round, their horns melting and flaring as Brock leads them in a sing-along about our own mortal fears. It's nothing new, but the central idea-- that we all want to keep moving forever-- puts an interesting spin on Brock's favorite subject. ""Guilty Cocker Spaniels"" and ""King Rat"" sound better for sounding more anthropomorphic, and yet for all their weirdness, the tracks barrel as forcefully as their singles, with Jeremiah Green's fluid drumming and the dense guitars matching Brock's fevered carnival barker delivery. Especially considering the EP's  title*, No One's First* opens and closely weakly. ""Satellite Skin"" is an adequate guitar jam and an obvious single in the vein of ""Float On"" and ""Dashboard"", albeit not nearly as catchy or as insistent, and ""I've Got It All (Most)"" never quite works up any real momentum to accompany its lyrical contradictions. It keeps trying to fade out long before it ends. On the other hand, the strongest part of the EP is its middle. Drawing from the same well as the opener and closer, ""History Sticks to Your Feet"" indulges the clash of frontwards and backwards guitar and the blistered staccato of Brock's bark to create the sense of rumbling rising action and thwarted release. On the other hand, he repeatedly rhymes ""history"" and ""mystery,"" which seems a bit unimaginative for such a careful songwriter. ""Autumn Beds"" seems to split the difference between the pop instincts of ""Float On"" and the rock anthems of ""Little Motel"" and ""Trailer Trash"", but comes out somewhere completely different. Brock can spit venom, but he can also write a supremely elegant melody, as he does here, and the banjogazer accompaniment bolsters the song-ending sing-along. In the EP's best sequencing flourish, ""Autumn Beds"" is followed by ""Whale Song"", a lengthy near-instrumental where the guitars sound like saxophones rather than maritime mammals. Set at a buzzy midtempo, it layers the guitars and later the vocals densely, recalling the scabrous attack of ""Doin' the Cockroach"" filtered through the stargazing sensibilities of ""The Stars Are Projectors"". Given its years-spanning tracklist, No One's First obviously has a retrospective flavor, but it also seems to point the way ahead for Modest Mouse, if only to suggest that the band will continue moving in opposite directions-- backwards and forwards-- all at once.","Collecting previously released songs from the late 00s, this comp is in the spirit ofÂ Building Nothing... and ...Parlour Tricks.

History of the Units,The Units,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54fea9e61561daa50e3/1:1/w_160/0c536183.jpg,2009-07-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13291-history-of-the-units/,Community Library,"""Fuck the guitars,"" blurts the anonymous author of the liner notes for History of the Units. ""I was sick of the sameness, the lack of choice. I wanted to start my own game."" Lofty goals to be sure, and perhaps an exaggeration of this San Francisco band's accomplishments. It's debatable whether their rejection of guitars in favor of synths in the late 1970s actually broke molds (though their habit of cutting guitar shapes out of plywood and smashing them at shows was certainly novel). But it's also not very important. What matters is the energy and commitment the Units brought to their electro-futurist post-punk. Whether doling out tight melodies, atmospheric instrumentals, or freer experiments, the Units attacked everything with an intensity that matched their sloganeering. On History of the Units-- a collection of singles, demos, and tracks from their debut LP Digital Stimulation-- their synths don't sound like guitars, but they pack as much sonic punch as any six-string. And their lyrical warnings about conformity and materialism-- ""This is a generation of cannibals!"" they sing in the pounding ""Cannibals""-- come in a monotone bark, mimicking what they saw as a society of unthinking robots. Listening 30 years after the fact, you might think the Units were mimicking something more specific-- Devo. The vocal similarities are undeniable, and certain songs could've been written by either group. Take ""Bugboy"", a stuttering tune about a kid who ""liked to torture bugs"" that's like a parallel version of ""Mongoloid"". But the Units happened at the same time thousands of miles away, so it's doubtful that there was much cross-influence. Besides, their sci-fi synths were more forward-looking. Often it sounds like they knew video games were right around the corner, and were crafting potential soundtracks. But the best Units songs push the hypnosis of synth-loops into the realm of irresistible melody. ""High Pressure Days"" marries a scratchy beat to cautions about the isolating influence of technology. ""We're all moving pretty fast these days,"" they chant. ""It's awful hard to hang onto each other... exchange phone numbers, wither away."" The chugging ""i Night"" sounds like the Advantage playing protest punk, while ""Digital Stimulation"" evokes Theremin-happy horror films. The group could stretch out too-- check ""East West 2"", whose lo-fi bleeps sound like a Raymond Scott experiment, or ""I-5"", whose polyrhythms conjure visions of Brian Eno honing the group's worldly leanings the way he did with Talking Heads. That kind of diversity makes History of the Units more than a sliver of post-punk history. It's the kind of reissue that makes you wonder why the music was ever out of print.","Thirty years after the fact, this ""lost"" San Francisco band sounds like it's imitating Devo; in its day, the group was wholly original and often compelling.

"Troubled, Shaken Etc.",Sian Alice Group,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5469d034d5c69bf327c/1:1/w_160/6a2a4a97.jpg,2009-07-31 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13283-troubled-shaken-etc/,Social Registry,"People tend to think of Sian Alice Group as shoegaze, but really, they're a post-rock band. One can hear traces of Tortoise and Godspeed You! Black Emperor in their sound, and there's an aesthetic and structural seriousness to how they present themselves on record. Take last year's mostly very good 59.59, which featured time-stamped instrumental intermissions separating each batch of its rock-leaning tracks. As pretentious as that may have seemed, it was also a convenient way for the group to divide its avant-garde material from its more straightforward pop songs. On their latest album, the less accessible and stylistically varied Troubled, Shaken Etc., Sian Alice Group look to combine those approaches in a more seamless manner. The desire here to more fully incorporate the experimental-- heard in the record's deeper explorations of free jazz, krautrock, and swirling instrumental passages-- makes for a far more ambitious outing than its predecessor. Troubled, Shaken Etc. eschews verse-chorus-verse structures, hooks, and easy melodies, and generally seems to ignore the fact that the attention span of today's listener is growing ever shorter. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with that-- and, heck, mp3-length focus is nothing to be proud of-- but there's an aloofness at play here that makes the album difficult to penetrate. Part of the reason is that Sian Alice Group tend to sound best at their most straightforward, and Troubled, Shaken Etc. excels during its simpler moments. It takes some time to get there, but the record finds its footing on ominous rock tracks such as ""Close to the Ground"", where frontwoman Sian Ahern's commanding vocals sit upfront in the mix and play off the foreboding arrangements behind them. A similar approach works on ""The Low Lights"", a fairly uncomplicated pop-rock number with rolling percussion and Ahern at her most vocally charming. And while I wouldn't mind if a few of the record's vocal-less cuts and slow dirges didn't make the final pressing, ""Longstrakt"" (note the ""k"" for krautrock!), repetitive and drum-heavy with blippy keyboard embellishments, is a welcome addition. Moments like these show a band versatile enough to work comfortably within several genres, but the record's low-energy moments elsewhere draw away from some of this success. Troubled, Shaken Etc. has a tendency to fall back on the morose, and tracks such as ""Grow Again, Repeat"" and ""To Thine Own Self Be True"", which are nearly funereal in tone, lack a certain spark that keeps me away from the ""back"" button. Ultimately this is a question of taste-- and plenty of folks like their music slow-moving and somber-- but the general avoidance of rhythm on some of these cuts poses a problem for me. It's a bit like the middle section of Grizzly Bear's recent Veckatimest, where the album just seems to be aching for a bit more soul. Of course, Sian Alice Group are a British avant-rock act and this brand of grave studiousness is sort of their calling card, so it would be silly to expect, say, a funk record the next time around. But I do think that a general loosening of the reins would go a long way.","Incorporating free jazz, krautrock, and swirling instrumental passages, the UK group's latest full-length is more ambitious than its predecessor.

Whether the war's happening in Vietnam or Iraq, garage-rock is essentially the musical equivalent of a superhero comic book-- it transforms shy, socially awkward young men into fuzzbox-stomping, skirt-chasing, government-overthrowing revolutionaries. The mostly failed attempts in the early part of this decade to reposition the music as a marketable hipster commodity overlooked this fundamental quality-- garage-rock is not a music for the masses; it's the private, fantastical domain of misfits. And in that sense, Austin, Texas, quartet the Strange Boys come just as advertised, coming on like the kids who sit in the back of the class and would gladly sign up for another hour of detention because it at least gives them something to look forward to. The Nuggets-vintage rudiments are all in place on Girls Club: maximized R&B rhythms and bright Rickenbacker strums; trebly, AM-radio-quality production (making them a natural In the Red addition); and, in frontman Ryan Sambol, a suitably nasal mouthpiece who suggests a young Bob Dylan had he spent more of his formative years in juvie halls than coffeehouses. But the Strange Boys' debut is notable for what it doesn't do-- though their songs are rife with references to guns, death, and terrorism, the Strange Boys do not behave like angry young men railing against the indignities of our time. They're just a little worried and confused, maintaining a steady, roadhouse-blues beat indicative of a band just trying to keep their shit together as the world around them seems to come apart. This sense of uncertainty is perfectly embodied by Sambol, who doesn't know whether he should get fucked up or join a militia-- as he wails on ""They're Building the Death Camps"": ""I'm scared because no one else around me seems scared/ I'd buy a gun and be prepared."" That the Strange Boys never actually blow their tops may prove a liability for garage-rock heads looking for more fierce, swift kicks, especially over the course of a 16-track album that would benefit from a few edits; straightforward bluesy shuffles like ""Who Needs Who More"" and ""Probation Blues"" sound like they would hit a lot harder in a live setting than the tempered, lo-fi presentation they're given here. But the Strange Boys are the kind of band that seem weirder and more threatening the nicer they play it, drawing us closer into Sambol's peculiar psyche: ""Should Have Shot Paul"" is a memo to Mark David Chapman delivered in a jaunty jangle and high-pitched harmonies, and within the graceful, Greenwich Village folk-rock of ""Then"", Sambol casually recounts the U.S. government's involvement in 9/11 as if it were received wisdom. Even his most graceful, open-hearted songs-- the swooning ""No Way for a Slave to Behave"" and the standout soul strut ""A Man You've Never Known""-- carry a whiff of misanthropy. ""Please understand,"" Sambol sings on the latter track, ""it's my job to write songs/ Allow me to do whatever I want."" And that is why generations of young men keep going back to the garage-- it's the only place in this world you can do just that.","In the Red garage-rock band sounds more like juvenile-delinquent Nuggets types than today's marketable hipster revivalists.

Hymn to the Immortal Wind,Mono,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5889d034d5c69bf3305/1:1/w_160/885c5fc2.jpg,2009-07-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13341-hymn-to-the-immortal-wind/,Temporary Residence,"To an extent, Mono resist critical analysis. The Japanese instrumental quartet has no lyrics to parse. It has little pop culture impact. The group has many imitators, but it remains superior. It is no longer formally interesting. For 10 years, it has unfurled long songs with quiet beginnings and stormy climaxes. Mono albums are different in the way AC/DC and MotÃ¶rhead ones are: they contain new combinations of old ingredients. Once a band establishes itself in music's canon-- and Mono has, next to post-rock colleagues Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky-- one either accepts or rejects its formula. The formula then replaces the canon as the critical yardstick. Now we compare Mono against itself. What makes Mono most critic-proof is their goal: to make the listener feel. Much music has this goal, but with Mono it is writ large. Melodies are achingly pretty; climaxes are blitzkriegs of flying hair and frantic strumming. Mono's songs are essentially power ballads. What separates them from CÃ©line Dion is a post-modern sense of cool: no lyrics to make sentiments cheesy, no over-production to earn critical scorn. Because they move slowly, Mono seem more cloaked than Dion. But they drop the hammer just as hard. Most Mono songs have a step-on-the-distortion-pedal moment that raises the emotional stakes. There's nothing wrong with that. Pixies, Nirvana, and Metallica all did it. Mono are better at it than most. ""Better"" is a subjective measure, though. Critics can analyze lyrics and sociocultural impact. But critics are no good with feelings. Explaining why a melody works is expressing the ineffable. (Sure, there's music theory. But V chords resolve to I chords all the time as they should, yet some bands do it better than others.) Most of the time, Mono's melodies work. That's why thousands flock to Mono shows and often cry there. Crying, of course, is the end of rational thought. Hymn to the Immortal Wind has probably caused floods of tears. That's a description, not a dis. The melodies are more sure-handed than ever. They are like missiles locked onto emotional buttons. More independence in the guitars helps sharpen this aim. The rhythm guitar often complements the lead guitar with counter-melodies, instead of merely shadowing it. Also, the band hired a chamber orchestra this time. Mono have augmented their sound in the past with small string ensembles. But now strings are all over the place, making everything bigger, lusher, and weepier. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand, the band has lost whatever skeletal veneer it had. In the past, with just two guitars, bass, and drums, it maintained some mystery before distortion pedal moments. Now it's filled in all its cracks. But, boy, do the strings amp things up. ""Everlasting Light"" is a good old-fashioned piano ballad that mushrooms to a Titanic-sized finale. Ms. Dion would be jealous. It's emotional manipulation of the highest order -- and that's OK. Surrendering to it is called ""enjoying music.""","Veteran Japanese instrumental quartet makes big, emotional hard/post-rock that aims to make a listener feel.

Julian Plenti Is... Skyscraper,Julian Plenti,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50313d1975652138e4c/1:1/w_160/e8d41e3d.jpg,2009-07-31 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13224-julian-plenti-is-skyscraper/,Matador,"On paper, this could have been an absolute trainwreck: Interpol guy resurrects his Eurotrash-y recording alias and puts out a solo album not-so-hot on the heels of his band's first truly not-good record. Though bassist Carlos D is probably the most widely lampooned member of Interpol, singer/guitarist Paul Banks-- he of ""HER STORIES ARE BORING AND STUFF"" and other louted lyrics-- often bears the brunt of unfair Joy Division comparisons and similarly unfair assertions that Interpol is ""just"" a rhythm section band. Banks' assumed moniker, and Skyscraper's ""Law & Order: Special Birthdays Unit"" artwork, didn't really do much to assuage the fear that this record would only provide more fodder for naysayers. Thankfully, the opposite is true: While Julian Plenti Is... Skyscraper is not as strong or as exciting as Interpol's first two records, it is certainly a step up from their third, and makes a good case for Banks' individual strengths within and without the band. None of which is to say that Skyscraper is a huge departure. ""Only If You Run"" is host to monolithic drums and layered guitars that would be right at home on an Interpol record. Even Banks' trademark delivery is largely unchanged here; I don't think anybody else could deliver the line, ""I've tasted degradation,"" with the same weirdly agitated flatness. Skyscraper leads off with two of its most Interpol-y tracks, which is in a way reassuring, but also evokes an unwelcome sense of deficiency. Banks' minimal, repetitive vocal lines leave a lot of room for the kind of propulsive instrumental flourishes at which Interpol excel, and without strong background players Banks occasionally comes across as minimal and repetitive in a less flattering sense. Only on ""Skyscraper"" does Banks begin to use this space to his advantage. On first listen, the song comes off as a bit overlong and heavy on atmosphere, but something about the way Banks measures out the syllables of ""shake me, shake me, skyscraper"" is strangely haunting. Here, the absence of Banks' bandmates works to his advantage; when he matches the intensity of Interpol's nimble and forceful rhythm section, Banks often SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SINGING IN ALL CAPS ALL THE TIME. Here, Banks has more room to explore a quieter register without it serving as a straight-up counterpoint to the ""loud"" songs (Ã  la ""Hands Away"" on Turn on the Bright Lights). Elsewhere, a similarly minimal approach has the opposite effect: On ""Unwind"", Banks explores exuberant pop in a way that Interpol never could, building an entire song around a simple vocal line, a drum loop, and trumpet fanfare. ""Games for Days"" shoots for a similarly triumphant big rock chorus via more conventional structure and arrangement, but lands on slick and generic. Predictably, there are some skeezy lyrics here, but-- as with Interpol's best songs-- they rarely seem at odds with the music itself, and often add to the air of unease that permeates much of the record. I don't know what exactly it says about Paul Banks, but the most borderline-embarrassing tracks on Skyscraper are, in fact, the strongest-- it's the safe, formulaic moments that fall flat and, unfortunately, make up a substantial portion of the record. Still, Skyscraper is difficult to complain too much about: It establishes Banks' viability as a musician outside of the context of Interpol, and it reaffirms the unique potency of Interpol as a band. RIGHT ON.","Interpol's Paul Banks resurrects his Eurotrash-y recording alias and puts out a solo album not-so-hot on the heels of his band's first truly not-good record.

Paint the Fence Invisible,Drug Rug,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a542ea9e61561daa50c5/1:1/w_160/b53c495d.jpeg,2009-07-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13279-paint-the-fence-invisible/,Black and Greene,"The world didn't need another romantic blues-rock combo; surely not one from Massachusetts, anyway. That said, Drug Rug managed to juice a bit of feeling and a couple of pretty great string-benders out of the too-familiar sound on their self-titled debut. It's a fine listen, but it's the kind of record where you could feel as though you were digging on the constituent elements-- Sarah Cronin's voice, the neo-primitive production, the occasional guitar stab-- rather than taking in a fully functioning song at play. Cronin still gets in a few howls and the occasional mewl, and Drug Rug's songs still have a loose, easygoing charm to them, but you'd be forgiven (and wrong) if you presumed a lineup change prior to the band's sophomore set, Paint the Fence Invisible. Nothing on Drug Rug predicted the bratty, almost Be Your Own Pet-like ""Hannah, Please"" or the New Pornographers-indebted rush of ""Haunting You"", but it's an easy shock to bear; Paint the Fence Invisible is maybe half as weird as its predecessor, but roughly twice as tuneful, and a hell of a lot more fun. After the shimmering but slight opener, ""Follow"", ""Haunting You"" rushes right out of the gate, buoyed by an insistent guitar chug and Cronin and Tommy Allen's tight harmonies; good as Cronin sounded on her own on Drug Rug, her voice sounds incredible when meshed with Allen's, and it's too bad she doesn't get more mic time here. ""Never Tell"" carries some of the twang over from the first LP but matches it with a steady stomp missing from the comparatively languid debut. There's a buzzy organ at the heart of ""Blue Moon"" that'd fall right into place on a ? and the Mysterians record, while ""Passes On"" has all the thud of Steppenwolf until the recorders drift in. This sonic expansion works in a couple of directions; another record like the debut would've meant a creative flatline, but Drug Rug always feel like a duo, and it's precisely enough ambition and sonic tinkering for two people making their second LP. One can't help but think of occasional Drug Rug tourmates Dr. Dog when hearing Invisible, a solid power-pop record largely devoid of any influence from the past three decades. Both bands certainly borrow liberally from late-60s production style and song structure, and both are so competent, so adept at placing hooks and solos and such in their ""proper"" place, it can leave you a little cold. But Drug Rug have allowed a bit of the drawl of their early work to carry over here, and even when they're playing it fairly straight, there's something slightly twisted about their melodies; if Dr. Dog are gunning for the Beatles, Drug Rug are going for Country Joe & the Fish-- this time. God knows who they'll sound like next.","Like their occasional tourmates Dr. Dog, this duo crafts solid power pop largely devoid of any influence from the past three decades.

Jamz n Jemz,Javelin,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5715e6ef95969320ad5/1:1/w_160/ae83d53a.jpg,2009-07-30 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13317-jamz-n-jemz/,self-released,"It takes some guts to structure your album around the J Dilla template, where you ask people to chase after a couple dozen downloads for a single LP. Though each cut hovers around the two-minute mark on records like this, they all make a lot more sense in the context of the whole. As we trek deeper into the jungles of ""Long Tail"" music consumption, this kind of structure feels almost brash. We're almost a decade into the ""return of the single"" era, but those who craft and consume albums as front-to-back endeavors-- even those built from fragments-- wear it as a badge of honor, resuscitating that nerdy elitism of eras that championed the impossibility of track-skipping. Javelin, comprised of New York City crate-rats George Langford and Tom Van Buskirk, certainly do their share of jumping around, never letting their listener get too close to an idea or a groove for very long. Jamz n Jemz, a CD-R they've been distributing at gigs, is flecked with brilliant little vignettes-- almost every one a gem, many of them certifiable jams-- that argue for the notion of a million little pieces coming together to make something much larger. Whether or not Jamz n Jemz achieves this in the way Javelin intended is somewhat moot; from a distance, the 17 ideas presented here aren't terribly cohesive and they certainly don't flow. But a larger statement looms: At a time when most people are DJs, it can be rewarding to simply hit ""Play"" and let the professionals handle it. David Byrne certainly gets it. His Luaka Bop imprint recently signed Javelin, immediately giving the guys control of the label's podcast to debut their Andean Ocean Tape, a curiously sly concoction of found sounds and nautically dizzying loops and breaks that reference everything from beach-psych to diet-dub, all outfitted with delightfully strange ticks, grumbles, and seagull squawks.Â Jamz n Jemz has the good sense to dig deeper, exploring sounds even more elemental and dance-ready. Javelin come over as hardcore cratediggers in the vein of artists like Quiet Village. The knob-twiddling is scarce and utterly unrecognizable amongst the patchwork of dime-store samples (their official band URL is dollarbinsofthefuture.com). It might be dubious to try and pinpoint exactly where and how much work is being put into these cut and paste jobs, but Javelin seem more like puzzle-solvers than puzzle-makers. The mystery only benefits the artistry of stutter-step weirdo hip-hop cuts like ""Susie Cues"" and ""Digits"" (an indictment of poor cellphone etiquette in movie theaters-- Javelin just earned a special place in my heart), whereas more complete and meticulously ""worked"" cuts like ""Oh Centra"" (a terrifically playful bit of 8-bit disco-hop) and the terribly titled ""Lindsay Brohan"" show signs of real musical prowess beyond having way too much fun with an MPC. Even at its most irreverent (check out the melting Elvis impersonator on ""Like Wood Would"" or the 1970s car chase flick nodding ""The Merkin Jerk (Take Three)""), Jamz n Jemz becomes less and less of an ""idea"" record than a simple celebration of reference, as magnetic opposites marry in the most familiar of ways. At a time when it seems like everyone's roommate is cooking up bargain-bin symphonies, Javelin stand out like two heady chefs, turning canned food classics into tiny little pieces of inspired, inverted gourmet reimaginings.","New York's Javelin are hardcore cratediggers in the vein of artists like Quiet Village but their sensibility is far more playful and informed by trash culture.

Clean Hands Go Foul,Khanate,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a471ea9e61561daa4ee8/1:1/w_160/de5cd6fc.jpg,2009-07-30 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13099-clean-hands-go-foul/,Hydra Head,"Clean Hands Go Foul, the fourth and likely final full-length from late experimental metal outsiders Khanate, deserves a warning label: ""Not recommended for those with mild-to-severe mental disturbances,"" it could read before countering, ""Well, just promise not to hurt anyone, OK?"" Its brittle, monstrous tones shake whatever space they enter. Riffs coil, shatter, and splinter into notes that disperse like buckshot. Words trade mythology for purely imagistic hatred. You could imagine Khanate pushing some feeble soul over the edge. This was true of Khanate on their previous LPs, but Clean Hands Go Foul-- which the band recorded in 2005 before breaking up in 2006-- ups the aggression until it feels like a score for nervous breakdowns and wanton rampages. Khanate once found a riff and marched behind it, cutting it open and bleeding it until but a din of feedback or a vortex of noise remained. Clean Hands doesn't worry so much for the riff or the rhythms, though. Instead, it aims directly for the blood, or the sense that these songs are for, well, ending the world. Cuddly stuff, really. The world's full of misanthropic and menacing music, but Khanate exist within a fairly isolated subset for their sonic, structural, and thematic instability. First, Stephen O'Malley, Alan Dubin, James Plotkin, and Tim Wyskida rarely cloak their implements of aggression. The lyrics share a pristine space with the monolithic guitar, drums, and bass, and Dubin crawls in front or slinks in the back as the moment demands. His piercing voice never needed much manipulation to be convincing, so most every word rings loud and clear. That is, when he opens the album screaming, ""It went down bad, and it's a sad life/ When angels break so easily,"" his clear words don't need much context, though those machete-shaped guitars behind him don't hurt. Or, on the sporadically escalating, painfully patient 33-minute closer, ""Every God Damn Thing"", you understand Dubin when he moans, ""Out there, someone's dying/ Hopefully/ It should be all of them/ I' [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| d step on them if I could."" Especially in extreme forms like metal, noise, and industrial music, bands often cloak their darkest thoughts in walls of distortion or the clangor of the surrounding instruments. Think about how many black metal lyrics you've easily picked out, or how many power electronics ideas you've spotted without liner notes. Khanate demand you intellectualize their verbal despair in real-time. And just in case you can't, the lyrics are reprinted in plain text. Khanate have always done that, though. What makes Clean Hands Go Foul the quartet's most menacing but intriguing effort ever is its new propensity for misdirection. Khanate don't push like metal, pull like drone, or raze like noise. Rather, it does all of those things in fitfully unpredictable fashion. Indeed, what's perhaps most frustrating about the band's break-up is, by this session, they'd become perfectionists in torturing by teasing. If not improved, their musicianship had certainly become more interesting. Tim Wyskida, for instance, used to lash at the backs of his bandmates, moving in obsequy. But here he gallivants with a heavy jazz freedom, suggesting Sunny Murray's roaming mind in Chris Hakius' powerful frame. Again on ""Wings From Spine"", Wyskida avoids any semblance of pattern. He trips through the kit, spinning cymbals around, slapping and silencing them in a single second. ""In That Corner"" continually approaches a groove, but the beat keeps splitting apart at the seams. The drums spill between the bass crests, and the guitar zips off in the opposite direction. Beneath its own top-heavy trudge, the track finally collapses. Plotkin's bass looms like a thunderhead, while the disappearing drums and trickling guitar splash against each other like puddles and raindrops. As sinister and frightening as these tracks might be to newcomers, both Khanate fans and slow-music enthusiasts might want to avoid the last number, the moribund ""Every God Damn Thing"". Before this last bit, Clean Hands is a fine Khanate EP. After ""Every God Damn Thing"", it's a mandatory finale. It's a sign of real Khanate progress right before the dreaded break-up.Â A fantastic study in the newfound patience of a very loud band that's discovered intensity can also be found in stillness, ""Every God Damn Thing"" presages the mix of acoustic and electric instruments on Sunn O)))'s Monoliths & Dimensions. Over 33 minutes, Khanate creep, generating tones to let them dissipate, howling about hell and deformed children to let those thoughts evaporate. Its deliberate movement recalls experimental Japanese electronic music and Derek Bailey's free-form guitar explorations. By the time Khanate hit the 30 minute mark, they're roaring glacially, huge cymbal splashes and rolls splattering against roiling bass and guitar and what might be Dubin's quintessential Khanate statement: ""It's all bad again/ It's all bad/ Get out-- my head."" Too bad the band, presumably done forever, took that as its credo, too.","Presumably now done forever, Khanate go out kicking and screaming as always, making music that-- even in the realm of extreme music-- is dark and distorted.

Hard Islands,Nathan Fake,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42f5e6ef959693207f6/1:1/w_160/914d63a1.jpg,2009-07-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13043-hard-islands/,Border Community,"While Nathan Fake's first full-length album (2006's Drowning in a Sea of Love) totally worked as a listenable and light-as-air take on the whole pastoral IDM thing, it also posed more questions about Fake's future than it answered. Consisting primarily of swathes of quivering synths intermingling with effortlessly melodic plinks and plonks, Drowning didn't just come on the death knell of that particular strand of electronic music-- it pretty much soundtracked it. Three years on, it's hard to imagine there's much of an appetite for any new music that sounds like Boards of Canada that isn't actually, you know, by Boards of Canada-- so what next for the 25-year-old Fake? The answer, as it turns out, lies with his earlier EPs. Fake may have won psych-IDM accolades for the woozy swathes of noise highlighted by James Holden's seminal refit of ""The Sky Was Pink"" (for my money, one of the best 10 remixes of the decade), but his output before that was significantly more rhythm-obsessed. From 2003's unabashedly banging ""Outhouse"" to the more pointillist techno of 2005's ""Dinamo"", his initial string of 7""s and 12""s put an emphasis on the low-end that his post-""Pink"" work pretty much ignored. On his second full-length, Hard Islands, Fake addresses the what-next problem by shifting his primary focus back to the rhythm section and scaling the immensity of his sound back to something substantially less unruly. If the serrated minimal of opener ""The Turtle"" isn't enough to convince you of his re-prioritization, consider how this LP title plays off the last; this is a record that sounds, in all senses of the phrase, more grounded. Which isn't to say that Fake's best trick (which involves a slowly deployed swathe of noise and feedback) has been retired altogether, just that he's learned to integrate it better. Beginning with a sharply minimal pulse and ending with a cacophony of flanged and reverbed organ pads, the aforementioned ""The Turtle"" is probably the album's single best example of that. Elsewhere, ""Basic Mountain"" marries a thumping minimal line with a detuned organ sound to similar effect, while album centerpiece ""Castle Rising"" bubbles with an acid-inspired synth line and a tech house-grounded rhythm. Meanwhile, with their scattershot rhythms, funhouse mirror melodies, and decaying synth leads, ""Narrier"" and ""Fentiger"" recall AFX's early day bubblebaths. If there's anything disappointing about Hard Islands, it's the sheer lack of material. With only six songs on offer-- one of which is a 75-second interlude called ""The Curlew""-- it's hard to feel like this is the assertive, confident statement Fake has it in him to make. As a strategic move out from the ghetto of nostalgic IDM Nowheresville, though, it'll suit just fine.","After the psych-IDM success ofÂ 2006'sÂ Drowning in a Sea of Love, the Border Community star scales back his sound and shifts his primary focus to rhythm.

Midlife: A Beginner's Guide to Blur,Blur,by: Scott Plagenhoef,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c4c0084474cd0c0574/1:1/w_160/dba14211.jpg,2009-07-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/,EMI,"At first glance, Midlife seems like one of those hilariously ambitious compilation titles that bands use when they don't want to admit the game is up-- think every group in its commercial and/or creative decline that calls a best-of ""volume one."" In Blur's case, the band's four original members have recorded exactly three new songs together this decade, and despite a recent run of successful reunion shows in the UK, they announced last week that they'd not be making new music as a quartet anytime soon. And judging by the tracklisting, they could have called this Midlife Crisis, as the compilation-- which eschews many of the group's biggest hits and best-known songs for album tracks-- finds them attempting to reshape their identity, reaching for the dronier, artier end of their catalog. As a bonus then, this comp actually serves a pair of actual purposes: To give new listeners interested in the group as an artistic rather than commercial force a nice, career-spanning entry point, and to give those only familiar with the band through its hits (as collected on 2000's Best of Blur or, if you're in Europe, heard on the radio throughout the 1990s) a deeper and wider look at its work. Still, the first thing any fan will notice is what's missing: Eight of the 18 songs from Best Of have been axed, including key singles ""Country House"", ""There's No Other Way"", ""On Your Own"", ""End of a Century"", and ""To the End""-- the latter two most likely so the 25-song set doesn't repeat too much of Blur's biggest album, Parklife. Chirpy third-tier singles ""Charmless Man"", ""Bang"", and ""Sunday Sunday"" are also absent but unmissed. So this compilation can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States. Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur-- and this at a time when, thanks to globalization and the internet, the cachÃ© of romanticizing other nations as exotic or different largely dwindled. Anglophilia in the States was once the province of those willing to take the time and effort to look outside their immediate surroundings, and with that came the attendant feelings of acting or thinking differently from one's peers that often fuels cultural choices, especially in indie circles. Nowadays, the UK feels and acts a hell of a lot more like, well, the U.S., and the internet has made the practice of looking in on a band from Britain the same as checking out one from Brooklyn. So while it's no surprise that Blur have become more central to American indie listeners' lives this decade, it's not due to intensifying their position wthin niches and subcultures but simply drawing in larger numbers of people. Blur leader Damon Albarn certainly embraced his Anglo nature at a few junctures in his career-- particularly after a 44-date, morale-sapping 1992 trek around America supporting the warmed-over Madchester of their debut LP, Leisure. The tour left the group frayed and, above all, determined to reject the dour earnestness of grunge. At the same time, Suede became the darlings of London indie by exaggerating many of the basic tenants of British guitar pop-- wit, glamour, artifice. In short, everything grunge wasn't. With their distaste for America sharpened, Blur played along, going all in on what was soon to be called Britpop, starting with their second full-length, Modern Life Is Rubbish-- the first of three albums in a so-called British trilogy that also included 1994's Parklife and 1995's The Great Escape. Fully embracing the UK's art-pop history, Blur's London- and UK-centric records made them superstars. Less celebratory than they at first seem, these records are teeming with despair and dripping with disdain. From Phil Daniels' title-track monologue to discouraging traffic reports to suicidal thoughts on the Cliffs of Dover, all was not well. Parklife's low point is also the band's artistic peak: The tempestuous, atmospheric ""This Is a Low"", with Albarn's reading of the English shipping report over Coxon's backward guitar was an admission that this once-dominant island nation was increasingly sheltered and inward. There is a sort of spectral finisterre quality to the song's tracing the outline of England by boat, and because those shipping reports-- news from the end of the world-- used to sign off the BBC's nightly radio broadcasts, the song almost sounds as if it could be the nation's lullaby. The sun once never set on the British Empire; this song seems to indicate that it now did so nightly-- in a haze of depression and doubt. It's fitting then that Midlife includes not only the celebratory (""For Tomorrow""), the heavily Anglo-coded (""Parklife""), and the snarky (""Girls & Boys""), but also ""This Is a Low"" and other nods to the diversity of these albums, chief among them The Great Escape's ""He Thought of Cars"" (arguably their most underrated song), Modern Life's ""Blue Jeans"" (a paean to mundanity) and ""Advert"" (like ""Girls & Boys"", a riff on consumer and leisure culture), and Parklife's ""Badhead"" (an odd substitute here for the record's more well-known relationship-splitting soundtrack, ""To the End""). Despite the cravenness with which it seemed Blur-- Albarn and bassist Alex James, in particular-- sought and reveled in fame, this portion of their career is dominated by songs about pre-millennial tension, the dangers of conspicuous consumption, and social changes regarding shifts in technology and communication. In retrospect these prescient sentiments are the strongest and most compelling threads of their mid-90s work; rather than celebrate Britain with knees-up Mockneyisms, they often painted real warnings about a nation quickly being engulfed in obsessions with consumer and celebrity culture. In the years after World War II, America's exportation of such culture was seen as powerful, endearing, the sign of an emergent nation that would dominate the second half of the century as Britain once did. By the 90s, however, Blur had correctly identified the U.S./UK axis as perpetually spoiled and distracted and these themes often dominated their songs. But without the moaning and brooding of peers like Radiohead, Tricky, or Pulp, the messages were often glossed over. Stardom, it turned out, left Blur fractured, with Coxon-- a riot grrrl devotee and dyed-in-the-wool indie kid-- particularly adrift. His torment was poked at by his more jovial bandmate Alex James, who offered jokes like, ""What's 50 ft. long and has no pubic hair? The front row of a Blur concert."" By the time the group needed to film a video for late 1995 single ""The Universal"" (also included here), the promo couldn't even hide Coxon's dissatisfaction-- in almost every shot he is absent, sitting on the ground, or barely participating. Rather than split the group, Coxon's sensibilities instead found root in the band's music, and their next two albums-- 1997's Blur and 1999's 13-- ironically displayed an increased interest in lo-fi and other strands of American indie music, as well as totems of 1970s art-pop such as dub, krautrock, even free jazz and prog. And it was during these years that Blur's fame and reputation in the U.S. swelled, thanks to the endearing ""Coffee & TV"" video and the arena sports-ready ""Song 2"". (Mythbuster: Despite Blur being commonly called U.S. one-hit wonders, ""Song 2"" was the third-highest charting single of their career here, behind ""There's No Other Way"" and ""Girls & Boys"".)  Those LPs are sparsely represented here, however. The two big moments listed above, the gospel-tinged global hit ""Tender"", and UK No. 1 ""Beetlebum"" are present as expected, but beyond that group only two additional songs from each album are included-- the best of which are ""Trimm Trabb"", an excellent example of 13's engaging sprawl, and Blur's ""Death of a Party"", which now sounds like a proto-Gorillaz song. Early in the recording of 2003 LP Think Tank, Coxon finally left the band. The resulting record finds Blur in a strange space-- neutered without their primary instrumental force, caught between their pop impulses and Albarn's growing embrace of non-Western sounds, and generally disturbed over the Bush/Blair administrations' failures. Three songs here make the cut, highlighted-- not surprisingly-- by Coxon's sole contribution, ""Battery in Your Leg"". With hindsight, it's no surprise that Blur's star has shone so brightly again this decade in their absence. Despite the cries about careerism, they rarely settled into one spot for long, and even when they were correctly perceived to have done so-- about one half of The Great Escape really is a Parklife retread-- they were still spreading their collective wings on album tracks and B-sides. (Indeed, the great irony of Blur's second decade is that Albarn, once the prince of Britpop, has spent the past 10 years becoming a 21st century David Byrne, a sharp, respectful pan-global figure through which many U.S. and UK listeners have stepped into multiple strains of African music, Arabic music, Jamaican music-- even Chinese opera.) Whether or not they continue to tour, record again, or really are calling it quits this time, the distance between their years of tabloid fame (and sometimes punchable ubiquity in the UK) and today has stripped away a lot of preening and the press and left their legacy enriched only by their music. Unlike a lot of rock's image-conscious genre-hoppers that music is sturdy, sometimes whipsmart, and endowed with more cracks and crevices and corners in which listeners can become lost than they're often given credit.","A new comp from a band whose stature has only grown in its absence finds Blur reshaping their identity and favoring the artier end of their catalog.

Arecibo Message,Boxcutter,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a213d1975652138d62/1:1/w_160/20d28687.jpg,2009-07-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13139-arecibo-message/,Planet Âµ,"Boxcutter knows his shit. At least that's the impression he leaves listening to Arecibo Message: a man who's studied the past 20 years of electronic music with a historian's eye for exacting detail, if not exactly an innovator's need to prod unexpected pleasure centers. The rhythmic choices, springing from Boxcutter's previous work, make this music dubstep, at least nominally. But very little about the album otherwise points to any of the London bass-centric subgenre's current stylsitic conceits, save perhaps a sonic palette that tends toward the days of repurposed Atari 2600 SFX set to a beat. Arecibo Message reflects a longer and stronger lineage, one that starts well before FWD>> opened its doors or South Londoners began siphoning the estrogen from two-step. And so for the most part we get a mash note, in the form of non-referential homage, to the housebound geniuses who left their rainbow-tinted fingerprints all over white label buyers' expectations in a post-acid world. The boogie b-line and retro-brittle handclaps on ""S p a c e b a s s"" are the breakdance-friendly roots of all those hip-hop import fiends whose spastic enthusiasm for shuddering synthetic beats would have them dubbed ""I.D.M."" a few years later. Likewise, ""Free House Acid"" is yet another attempt to make overlapping quasi-acidic bleeps harmonize like dueling opera singers in a Chuck Jones cartoon. And for every fleet slice of dark, swinging neo-garage (like ""Mya Rave v2""), there's something like the title track, which splits the difference between the stiff-limbed early days of Warp Records and the label's convoluted second wave, rigid LFO suddenly nipped and tucked a thousand times over into something closer to Autechre. Two things keep Boxcutter's latest from the tedium of unchecked nostalgia for sounds which never left us long enough to be missed. One, the garage-ish tempos mean all that acidic filigree never gets overbearing the way it can when combined with the ""look ma, no brakes"" programming that's the bane of Boxcutter's post-drill'n'bass peers. And two, he's wedded to neither the sound of 1989 or 1999; curveballs like the slanted J Dilla funk of ""A Cosmic Parent"" keep Arecibo Message from simply being a experiment in bleeding one rave era into another. Still, most of the album is throwback enough to be a pleasant one-off, not so much a work of fevered straining at a genre's edges so much as a well-crafted nod to the O.G.'s of Brit bleeping, made with grace and a smile. And if you've been lamenting a lack of hairy electro-tinged riffage in your life, here's a quick re-up.","Nominally dubstep, this LP is the work of a man who'sÂ studied the past 20 years of electronic music with a historian's eye for exacting detail.

Tuota Tuota,Kiila,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a3b1335d7bf16989ee/1:1/w_160/e2170d55.jpg,2009-07-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13140-tuota-tuota/,Fonal,"There is no beginner's Fonal band: Every artist on the familial Finnish label wilds off in strange directions, eschewing almost all Western music norms and most others as well. But Kiila, one of the only Fonal bands who occasionally flirt with English (their debut album: Heartcore), might be close: Tuota Tuota, the band's third album, trades in lush, North-country arrangements and silvery group chants. You can probably still count the truly coherent pop moments on one hand, but the fact that you can count them at all places Tuota Tuota squarely on Fonal's skinny axis of accessibility. Faust have long been considered the most bucolic of the Krautrockers, famously recording their albums in an old schoolhouse; Kiila aim for that sprawl on Tuota Tuota (""Well Well""), the six-strong troupe extending their many limbs over all manner of countryside tremble. Kiila unsurprisingly trade in European traditions, echoing the shapeshifting Incredible String Band, the elegant hum of John Martyn, or the accumulating stir of Peter BrÃ¶tzmann and so many other free improv stalwarts. An intimidating list of influence, maybe, but Kiila rarely strain or stumble on Tuota Tuota. Opening hymn ""Viisi Hirvasta"" is as careful and reverent as anything the band has put to tape. Simple acoustic guitar lines mix with surface stirring until, three minutes later, a strident fiddle grabs the song by its collar, if only for a moment, and shakes some clarity out of it. That same fiddle announces the purposeful, rock-land gait of ""KevÃ¤tlaulu"", which Kiila proceed to rollick through for three no-fat minutes. This sort of between-tracks interplay benefits Tuota Tuota, whose seven tracks alternate between short and peppy and long and winding; it even spins like one of those old Faust albums. The affair is more strung-together and traceable than 2004's SilmÃ¤t Sulkaset, which saw Kiila falling more in line with Fonal's reputation for untenable forest children.Â The contrasts are heartfelt and charming, if occasionally jarring: Moments after ""Niin Kuin Puut"" delivers the album's most tender country paean, ""Kehotuslaulu"" proposes to build an entire song out of a fiddle breakdown. It is fun music in a decidedly un-fun realm (Finnish-language experimental music), and even when Kiila return to softer compositions, Tuota Tuota retains an air of parlor-room conversation. The final six minutes-- devoted to ""PÃ¶llÃ¶tulkin Mietteet"", which charges downhill on strangely phasing funk guitars, wildman organ and ornery trumpeting-- provide a strange end to an album mostly intent on crafting homey, wooden revelries. But Kiila never ask you to gulp down their sprawl: the jamming is modest, the songcraft repeatable and molded. Tuota Tuota joyfully balances the band's experimental tendencies with tender, aged songcraft. Tuota Tuota is friendly skree for the intimidated.","Finland's consistently intriguing and rewarding Fonal label offers another mix of Northern European folk and free improv.

Saskamodie,Mocky,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a518c0084474cd0c0644/1:1/w_160/70154d42.jpg,2009-07-29 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13240-saskamodie/,Crammed Discs,"The ""Mockumentary"" for Mocky's new album, Saskamodie, portrays the musician as a kind of musical Zelig, turning up in archival footage of 1950s Egyptian jazz, a 1979 mariachi concert, Japanese koto drumming, even participating in a three-way drum battle with Art Blakey and Elvin Jones. Narrated by a graybeard music professor and featuring cameos from collaborators like Feist, Jamie Lidell, and Gonzales, it's a clever conceit brilliantly executed, and probably deserving of some sort of prize, if there's anything like a Grammy for best online EPK. But such a jokey angle doesn't really doesn't do justice to the album. Mocky (Toronto's Dominic Solale, long based in Berlin) isn't so much chameleonic as exceptionally versatile, as he's shown again and again as a songwriter, arranger, backup musician, and producer for the likes of Feist, Lidell, and Jane Birkin. (It's hard to think of any other musician that's worked with both Kevin Blechdom and Nikka Costa.) Reflecting the broad pop sensibilities of those collaborations, Saskamodie ditches the quirky electro-funk of previous Mocky albums in favor of acoustic instrumentation and lilting songs in the spirit of 60s lounge jazz and easy-listening soul. Mocky and his accomplices recorded the album in two weeks at Paris' Ferber Studios, the site of classic recordings by Nina Simone and Serge Gainsbourg. He paid for the sessions out of the winnings of a lawsuit against an Austrian supermarket chain that had used his music without permission, a detail that might seem extraneous if it weren't so metaphorically fitting, Mocky weaving contemporary free-market capitalism's dross into golden shapes evocative of a simpler, but also more ambitious, musical era. Saskamodie isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, a ""challenging"" record. Around a traditional jazz rhythm section, the diffuse strings, glockenspiels, and woodwinds carry a whiff of lite-FM. Tempo and timbre both favor lullaby moods; melodic riffs laze and lilt, shadowed by harmonies as dulcet as they come. Saskamodie is an exceptionally intimate album, the product of a close-knit group effacing their own egos behind the ghosts lingering in their chosen studio. Mocky, who has a wonderfully warm, throaty voice, nestles his singing in amongst the instrumental tracks, rarely letting lyrics assume center stage. You might not even notice Feist's contribution, which peeks over the mix's horizon in faint close harmony. ""Music to My Ears"" features Lidell but forgoes words entirely, with rounded syllables stepping in unison with piano and bass. Indeed, it might take some close listening before you realize that many of the album's vocal tracks are wordless. Even ""Birds of a Feather"" (featuring Gonzales and Joel Gibb), one of the record's few songs with actual lyrics, carries the refrain with a chorus of whistling. But instead of coming off as kitsch, it's one of the album's most innocent and compelling moments, summing up the whole question of musical expression with childlike simplicity. Couched in yielding textures and hushed tones, the album might initially come off as slight. The easy-listening touches are loaded signifiers, after all, and a kind of critical shutdown is a not-inconceivable response. This ain't Battles, but it also isn't fluff. It took me some time-- a few weeks of listening, followed by a month spent away from the album-- for me to hear beyond the airy sonics and allow the full weight of the songwriting and arrangements to sink in. When they do, you'll be struck by Saskamodie's wit and grace. It's an inspired, giving album whose generosity is masked by its easygoing veneer. It's an exceptionally musical album-- there's no other word for it-- that could fail to seduce only the hardest of hearing, or the hardest of hearts.

My World,Lee Fields & the Expressions,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5835e6ef95969320b01/1:1/w_160/4fdfb14d.jpg,2009-07-29 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13333-my-world/,Truth & Soul,"Lee Fields is the real deal. The revival of old-school funk and soul sounds that began with Desco Records in New York and bands like Germany's Poets of Rhythm in the 1990s has produced a lot of fantastic throwback music, some of which stands right alongside the real thing from the late 60s and early 70s. Sharon Jones may be the queen of American revivalist soul, but what's easy to forget is that Jones was discovered by Phillip Lehman and Gabriel Roth singing backup for Fields on a session in the mid-90s. Fields cut his first 45 in 1969, a series of follow-ups on tiny labels in the 70s, then recorded an album in 1979 before disappearing for most of the 80s. He recorded a few albums for Ace in the 90s before landing at Desco and its offspring, Daptone and Soul Fire. Now he's with Truth & Soul, and that crew, led by Leon (aka El) Michels, has helped him create one smoking mother of an old-sound soul record. There's a subtle hint of hip-hop in this brand of deep soul, but for the most part, it sounds like something that easily could have come out of some imaginary mid-point between Stax, Muscle Shoals, and Philadelphia International in about 1971. A few of the Southern-style ballads on My World are simply stunning, especially ""Honey Dove"". This is at least the third time he's recorded the song, and this version is a total bomb-- Fields sweats through every second as the guitar channels Steve Cropper, horns and a small string section drift through the languid rhythm, and Homer Steinweiss lays down a perfectly understated and sharp drum part. Steinweiss and the rest of the Expressions clearly feel this music and don't sound like mere imitators. They serve up an inventive arrangement on the moralistic funk track ""Money I$ King"", which is essentially through-composed-- the horns constantly shift, working up to a dissonant finale. The haunting backing vocals, bells, and shivering strings that color the cover of the Supremes' ""My World Is Empty Without You"" show a lot of imagination and a willingness to interpret a stone classic rather than simply parroting it. ""Love Comes and Goes"", with its big harmony vocal on the chorus, also takes the form out of its box a little. Fields has been sampled a number of times by hip-hop artists, and he and the Expressions seem to invite another heist on the title track, offering up a tasty drum break and a supremely moody rhythm track that drips with vibraphone and pitch-black guitar. Even the instrumental ""Expressions Theme"" is solid, playing like a descendant of Young-Holt Unlimited's ""Soulful Strut"" and Willie Mitchell's solo LPs for Hi. For about 40 minutes, My World is like taking a trip back almost five decades. It loses a bit of steam at the end, but if there was any doubt Fields was still the real deal 40 years after his first record, this should obliterate it. My World is a throwback done right.","Real-deal old-school funk and soul singer makes a tremendous comeback on a record that mixes elements of the Stax, Muscle Shoals, and Philly soul sounds.

The Magic Couple,Amadou & Mariam,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a589c0084474cd0c074e/1:1/w_160/cad20e65.jpg,2009-07-29 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13343-the-magic-couple/,Wrasse,"Amadou & Mariam spent much of the last month opening for Coldplay. They're friends with Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz) and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. They live a jetset life traveling between Africa, Europe, and North America to play shows and record. They've made a record with global megastar Manu Chao, and back home in Mali, their son is a successful rapper. By any standard, they've had one heck of a run since 2005's excellent Dimanche Ã  Bamako established them as major world music stars. And they deserved all of it, not only because their music was great, but because they spent nearly three decades earning it. Mariam Doumbia and Amadou Bagayoko met at the Institute for the Young Blind in Bamako in the 1970s and have made music together ever since, first traveling abroad to record in Abidjan, Ivory Coast in the early 90s. I've heard those early recordings, and they're quite spare, just the two voices and Amadou's mellifluous guitar playing. Even so, the sound they established then is still very much apparent in the maximalist, pan-global pop records they've made recently. They began adding a band in the mid-90s, finally traveling to Europe late in the decade to record. It's this transitional phase, where the duo began to try on a dizzying array of styles and incorporate a broad range of instrumentation, that's covered on The Magic Couple, a sharp retrospective that shows clearly that they didn't arrive at Dimanche Ã  Bamako and Welcome to Mali by accident. The set draws from three albums, Sou Ni Tile, Tje Ni Mousso, and Wati, recorded from 1997-2001 and released in 1999, 2000, and 2003, respectively. (It has a very different tracklisting from Je Pense Ã  Toi, another A&M best-of released several years ago that covers roughly the same period.) The tracks of the three LPs are jumbled together in favor of flow, and the period of recording covered here is so distinct and unified that the lack of chronological tracking isn't really a big deal. Wati is only represented by two tracks, but they're clear arrows pointing to their watershed. ""Sarama (La Charmante)"" is generously splattered with tumbling jazz piano, an extremely unusual texture for Malian music, while ""Poulo (Les Peuls)"", a song about an ethnic group from the Sahel region more widely known as the Fulani, has a hyperspace beat that mixes kit drumming, slashing guitar, and traditional flute and stirs. Flute also drives the hard funk of Tje Ni Mousso's ""Beki Miri"", a song that finds Amadou leaning on his wah pedal as he and Mariam sing in unison. Tje Ni Mousso is the funkiest of the three albums drawn from here, and it produces what might be the compilation highlight in ""Chantez-Chantez"". The song is an interstellar Afrofunk jam, riding a heavy, sped-up ""Green Onions"" groove from Mali to Memphis and back. Amadou reels off a brilliant guitar solo that's enough to make me a little sad that his guitar has been relatively played down on their last two albums. At the other end of the spectrum is ""Je Pense a Toi"", one of the duo's most stunningly gorgeous songs. The couple sings its way in and out of harmony over simple hand percussion while Amadou's snaking guitar trades leads with a cello played in a mixture of Arabic and European styles. The Magic Couple is a good overview of the middle period of Amadou & Mariam's recording career, and should serve a lot of listeners who got on board with Dimanche or Welcome quite well. If you like Amadou's guitar work, you'll be happy to hear a lot more of it right out front here than on their two most well-known albums. If you're very into the group's sound, you might do better to skip past this and simply pick up all three albums-- they're still available, and they're all very solid. If all you need is the overview, though, this will do the trick.","Malian duo have its late-1990s, early 2000s work for A&M collected and compiled for a second time, but first since becoming global superstars.

El Radio,Chris Garneau,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ee13d1975652138e21/1:1/w_160/1af9d952.jpg,2009-07-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13204-el-radio/,Absolutely Kosher,"Chris Garneau's El Radio begins with the mournful sound of minor-key harmonium and strings, drawing out sad chords our brains seem hard-wired to respond to. Garneau knows this. These melodramatic chords and melodies wended their way through his debut Music for Tourists, and his follow up El Radio is rife with them as well. Simple progressions, heart-on-sleeve lyrics, Garneau's own little boy singing-- his innocence and earnestness is apparent, but at the same time if he makes this stuff sound easy it's because, generally speaking, it is easy. (see: our brains, hard-wired). While far from pastiche, El Radio does explore, at least in passing, such familiar territory as chamber pop and theatrical Eastern European-flavored showtunes, and if there's anything working in Garneau's favor it's that he works within these frameworks with an ear for space. With kitchen-sink indie at its apex, Garneau often goes the other way, stripping his songs down to their minimal components. Songs such as ""Dirty Night Clowns"" or ""Fireflies"" might have a lot going on in them, but they're by no means cluttered, which keeps the focus keenly on those simple melodies and Garneau's almost androgynously high (though rarely keening) voice. Yet even relatively pared down and hushed, El Radio is steeped in affectation, from its vaguely cabaret bent to its mopey singer-songwriter tropes. ""Over and Over"" and ""Hands on the Radio"" are certainly pretty, but they're also so precious it's almost unbearable, and not in the emotional way. On ""Things She Said"", Garneau almost sounds like he's playing a character, not in the story-song sense but like a secondary performer taking a solo turn in the spotlight in an off-Broadway musical. The winsome ""No More Pirates"" benefits greatly from Garneau's tidy arrangement, but it, too, sounds like a beat in a story we don't get. In fact, like friend Duncan Sheik, that may ultimately prove the best place for Garneau's particular talents. In the context of the LP, Garneau's songs typically connect only on the most facile of levels-- those easy sad chords, plinking piano keys and the like-- but in service of a story, a narrative, they might gain a little more meaning. Ending the disc with ""Black Hawk Waltz"", another soft, minor key instrumental, givesÂ El Radio its conclusion, but little that preceded it leaves enough of an impression to enhance or amplify the album's erstwhile final punctuation. For music that aims to ply the heart, El Radio ultimately lacks in noticeable passion, leaving the listener lingering outside Garneau's little world, waiting to be let in.","With simple progressions and heart-on-sleeve lyrics, this singer-songwriter'sÂ innocence and earnestness makes for roomy, breezy kitchen-sink indie.

Trying to find a whole lot of Fol Chen info, photographic or otherwise, on the web is a big fat waste of time. And presumably, they want you to listen to their debut and think, ""man, who are Fol Chen?"" Of course, that can just as easily turn into a dismissive ""man, who the fuck are Fol Chen?"" Especially when similar tactics worked for intentionally faceless and musically mysterious acts from (early) Sunny Day Real Estate to the Knife to the Sincerely Yours crew, and these guys play a click-push electro-acoustic pop thing whose first priority should be distancing itself from the similar likes of Anathallo and Le Loup. And yet for all of their attempts at presenting a consolidated front, Fol Chen make good on their charge on account of being a deceptively good singles act. Opener ""The Believers"" sets out to establish a mood with vague conspiratorial lyrics and generally ""album track""-ness, but it's a flat opener; follow-up ""No Wedding Cake"" makes good use of *Remain in Light-*styled funk guitar and an investment in motion. Likewise, ""The Idiot"" comes off like a less-stylized, more approachable Junior Boys, doing the old C&W trick of offering dedication as a proper substitute to one's intelligence. But if this all sounds a little too cutesy in that 2005 way to you, Fol Chen distinguish themselves during John Shade's midsection with some seriously percussive production. ""Red Skies Over Garden City (The Ballad of Donna Donna)"" tumbles out of the court of King Crimson with cavernous drum patterns, while ""Winter, That's All"" manages a stomp-the-yard drumline mixed with rave keyboards. But if you're gonna pick a breakout single from John Shade, your best bet is ""Cable TV"". It's lyrical idea is clichÃ©, but there's a certain sense of slink (if not necessarily sexiness) that recalls, I dunno, Bran Van 3000 or any number of late-1990s one-offs-- its ""Killing Me Softly""-style sitar drop is just dorky enough to be kinda loveable. As good as ""Cable TV"" and ""Winter, That's All"" sound, *John Shade'*s main weakness was supposed to be its strength-- during the points where the tempo dies down and the songwriting hues closer to traditional forms, there's not enough personality or character in the vocals to compensate, leading to stretches of indie promo-pile filler. Not quite up to the level that Fol Chen consider themselves at-- they've compared their music to the obelisk that graces the cover of Led Zeppelin's Presence (be forewarned that it sounds nothing like, say, ""Achilles Last Stand"" or ""Tea for One""), and while it's not that transfixing, Fol Chen at least have our attention going forward.","The mysterious Fol Chen playÂ click-push electro-acoustic pop that attempts to sound like Junior Boys in places, Talking Heads in others.

Rewild,Amazing Baby,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a549b1335d7bf1698b6e/1:1/w_160/6594ca9c.jpg,2009-07-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13286-rewild/,V2Shangri-La Music,"Coming straight out of Wesleyan to score a ton of SXSW buzz, bro-ing down with MGMT, getting breathless future-of-the-scene press from Interview and Rolling Stone and The Guardian, strutting around in 1971 cosplay while rolling their eyes at journalists who try to connect their hippie chic with actual usage of psychotropic substances-- there are plenty of reasons for skeptics to violently reject Amazing Baby. Granted, they're not particularly useful reasons, what with them having more to do with scenester anxiety and cred wars than anything, but they're floating around right now and muddling up the discourse. Fortunately, they have an album out now, which means that extrapolating judgments from little more than a 7"", an EP, and the dreaded Williamsburg address is no longer necessary. And here's a shock: Rewild isn't brought down by irony or posing or whatever it is about trust funds and/or beards that's supposed to make music shitty-- it's just a really scattershot debut, albeit a frequently entertaining one. Amazing Baby seem to be at the point in their young career where they're a short distance away from transitioning out of the traditional ""riffing off bands we like"" phase, and while there's a healthy eclecticism to their nebulous classic rock affectations, they do a better job at creating interesting variations of known quantities than transcending them. Opener ""Bayonets"" features a more muscular take on ELO's baroque, string-driven prog-pop, ""Invisible Palace"" towers like Pink Floyd's ""Astronomy Domine"" reproduced in neon and buffed to a metal-flake shine, ""The Narwhal"" is an amped-up, bongo-driven echo of Led Zeppelin's ""The Battle of Evermore"", and ""Dead Light"" and ""Headdress"" are perforated with glimmering shards of T. Rex. Still, it's a sign of hope that their stuff's hooky enough to transcend their semi-obvious source material, and combining early-70s rock histrionics with glossy post-electro party-rock wildness is a promising formula. But to get past the decent-pastiche stage, they still need a little work in the identity department. Frontman Will Roan has a voice that can't stick to a single memorable template, so he shades towards Marc Bolan astral swagger one moment and Donovan pastoralism the next. The single most consistent thing about his voice is how dazed and mumbly it sounds, which is either an asset or a detriment depending on how far towards dope-haze swooning any given song skews; he sounds effortlessly majestic in the gauzy slog of ""Pump Yr Brakes"" but smothered and lagging beneath the energetic uptempo charge of ""Kankra"". Simon O'Connor, guitarist and the other half of the band's core founding duo, has a broader problem: he drowns his instrument in so much arena-sized production glop it can be hard to tell what he's got going on stylistically beneath it all, though when he breaks out-- like he does in the squalling solos during ""Smoke Bros"" or ""Pump Yr Brakes""-- it's a pretty good jolt. (And since he played in Stylofone, who put out the great Thin Lizzy-toned riff-fest single ""Nighttime"" two and a half years ago, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.) This wall-of-gunk approach extends across the rest of the band, to the point where there's not a lot of breathing space; compare their Daytrotter sessions or the version of ""Headdress"" from their Infinite Fucking Cross EP to the overproduced re-recordings here and you'll hear what a subtler mix could do for these guys. That lack of breathing space, combined with Roan's mumbly-Joe tendencies, does obscure the hell out of the lyrics, which is a mixed blessing; Roan admitted to Rolling Stone that ""our lyrics are totally ridiculous sometimes,"" and it is at least to his credit he recognizes this. I'm not sure if that makes it more or less difficult to forgive ""Bayonets"" for using the phrase ""the kids are all right"" as part of its chorus, or ""Smoke Bros"" for its baffling refrain, ""We are starving cannibals/ She protects her animals."" I suppose when your closest lyrical analogue on the album's most memorable sing-along/chant-along line is Total Coelo, you risk alienating some people. But that's the kind of turf that can come with the feeling-out process, and there's enough lyrics that aren't goofy, uninspiring, or just plain illegible to make up for the ones that are. Unfortunately, the post-Web 2.0 hype cycle doesn't have time for growing pains; their reactionary approach tends to be enthusiastic first, then disappointed. Speaking as someone who would prefer to see the opposite happen-- letting bands dick around and get mediocrity out of their system before hitting on the inspiration that makes them worth following-- Rewild is how an average debut album should pan out. It might outstrip its ambition and wear its influences too blatantly, but Amazing Baby could be something special once it all clicks.","These MGMT buddies have been the focus of a comparable amount of early hype, and Rewild is an uneven but entertaining mix of pop-psych and glam rock.

Lovetune for Vacuum,Soap & Skin,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5485e6ef95969320a83/1:1/w_160/d45678e7.jpg,2009-07-28 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13285-lovetune-for-vacuum/,PIAS,"Kids these days listen to the darndest things. So it follows that they're in a position to make the darndest music, which is one way, perhaps, to describe what Anja Plaschg is doing with Soap&Skin, a project that's already turned a few heads in the young singer's native Austria. Plaschg recorded Lovetune for Vacuum, her debut album, while still a teenager, and the record is in many ways a document of what an ugly, awkward, erratic-- and, occasionally, glorious and transcendent-- process growing up can be. Tracks teeming with tension and lyrics detailing obsession and strife rub right up against moments of clarity and respite, just as Plaschg's chosen instrument, the piano, is sometimes usurped by more gnarled sounds of electronic origin. For all its connotations of purity, a vacuum, after all, is also a place where you can't breathe. Plaschg is part of a generation of music-lovers not bound by the strictures of geography and commerce, free to gorge on sounds in limitless abundance. So is it any wonder that Lovetune sounds like some unholy union of Nico and Regina Spektor and Aphex Twin and a sizable chunk of the Fonal and Monika rosters? And, sure, some You Are Free-era Cat Power too, and Autechre, and maybe Stina Nordenstam, and certainly BjÃ¶rk, and a good deal of the classical/art song vanguard as well. The Nico namedrop has the most currency, particularly given Plaschg's native tongue and the fact that she has already portrayed the iconic musician/model in a play back home. Indeed, it's tempting to posit Lovetune as the sort of record Nico might be making today had she not taken off on her bicycle that fateful day in 1988. Which brings us to Plaschg's most singular quality: her voice, a thing of great authority but not much grace that helps smooth over the parade of influences here into a unified whole. Even when she attempts the ethereal, as on ""Cry Wolf"", that voice still has an earthy, guttural weight to it, and when she uncloaks it completely to let out a full-on scream on ""Spiracle"" (live YouTube clips of this are worth seeking out), it blasts forth with all the violent colors of German Expressionist painting. There's a beauty-in-ugliness thing going on through much of Lovetune, in fact. ""Marche FunÃ¨bre"" throbs along on clusters of dense strings rendered severe and imposing by repetition, while the clatter of toys on ""Cry Wolf"" (the most Fonal-like moment here) sounds grating even as it suggests a yearning toward childhood. ""Wolf"" has an interesting parallel in the similarly clattery ""DDMMYYYY"", only there the toys have mutated into demon typewriters and fax machines performing what sounds like a rather nasty dissection. Call it growing pains. Elsewhere, such as on ""Turbine Womb"" and ""Brother of Sleep"", Plaschg's piano conjures images of serene repose, a temporary calm within the emotional storm that is just about any teen's inner state. ""Extinguish Me"" and ""Mr. Gaunt Pt 1000"" even tend toward the saccharine. She may be synthesizing a whole mess of influences, but there's no questioning Plaschg's talent for marrying what we might consider ""comfort music""-- sentimental, indulgent fare that's easy to cling to-- and the ""distance music"" of her more outrÃ© electronic and classical forbearers. By the end of closing track ""Brother of Sleep"", all is becalmed, right on through to the quiet sounds of the natural world that occupy the track's final minute. Yet just when we think it's over, along comes a single, ominous drum beat, suggesting the cycle of alternating clarity and agitation is poised to begin yet again. Soap has the ability to cleanse, but misapplied, it sure can sting too.","Young Austrian singer Anja Plaschg debuts with a darkly intriguing album that combines references as disparate as Regina Spektor and Autechre.

Ayrton Senna EP,Delorean,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58613d1975652138f93/1:1/w_160/b71544f9.jpeg,2009-07-28 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13339-ayrton-senna-ep/,Fool House,"Man, that Wavves ""meltdown"" really bummed me out. Not because a rising lo-fi rocker acted stupidly-- who doesn't sometimes?-- but because I'd always imagined being on ecstasy in Barcelona would be a lot more fun. After all, some of the most rewarding music from the last couple of years basically promised as much. Or was Swedish imprint Sincerely Yours being insincere? How about U.S. labels True Panther and Underwater Peoples? From Oslo to Melbourne, from indie rockers to club kids, sunny electronic euphoria has been one of the late-2000s pop underground's richest musical nodes. Just as that endless blissed-out summery vibe unites everyone from Panda Bear to Todd Terje, Barcelona electro-pop four-piece Delorean pull up at the intersection between several disparate and exciting movements. Start with their remixes: In the U.S., the bedroom pop of Glasser and disco-punk of Lemonade; in the UK, the NME-approved guitar rock of the Big Pink and Mystery Jets; and, right in Delorean's hometown, the sample-heavy tropical psych of El Guincho. They can be as airy and suave as Air France or Phoenix, but their unremitting beats are also plenty huge enough to convert fans of Cut Copy or MGMT. John Talabot, a Barcelona DJ who's released cosmic disco grooves for Munich label Permanent Vacation, lends a house remix to the group's current EP, Ayrton Senna. The third release on Fool House, the new label from French indie-dance blog Fluo Kids, Ayrton Senna represents a similar kind of convergence. In the early 2000s, Delorean originally set out to be something like Jimmy Eat World crossed with Elliott Smith, keyboardist Unai Lazcano confided to The Pop Manifesto magazine last summer. By the time of their promising Transatlantic KK album a couple of years ago, Delorean had absorbed the synth-pop sleekness of New Order and the echoey guitar spikes of post-punk revivalists like !!! or the Rapture, with one transcendent moment: so-called ""breakhop"" finale ""Apocalypse Ghetto Blast"". On the Ayrton Senna EP, the group's burgeoning dance-pop savvy comes into bloom with three unstoppable summer bangers, the Talabot remix, and a digital-only bonus cut. Despite their rock roots, Delorean do tracks, not songs. Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi is a Ph.D. candidate with a background in philosophy, but Delorean use his Factory-ready yelp more as just another element to loop than as a vehicle for delivering lyrical content. ""Seasun"" is the best example of Delorean's layered approach to composition, methodically building 1990s piano-house keyboards, disembodied female vocals, Baltimore club-ready handclaps, and a ringing guitar line into the ultimate beach house (not Beach House). But ""Deli"", with its breakbeats and youthful enthusiasm, and ""Moonson"", all 90s-house liberation and anthem-rock yearning, are almost as thrilling. Talabot's ""Kids & Drum"" remix of ""Seasun"" could well hold up after even more listens than the original version, its hand-percussion samples reaching closer to the islands but its vast, clean lines stretching out toward space. Prior to Ayrton Senna, arguably Delorean's most compelling release was its remix for oft-misunderstood electro-pop Serge Gainsbourgs the Teenagers. On last year's occasionally brilliant Reality Check, the French band's ""Love No"" is a hilarious, sleazy, and brutally scathing snipe at a nagging girlfriend who disapproves of the narrator's self-absorbed internet stonerdom. Delorean's bass-heavy ""No Love"" version-- like Studio's ""Possible"" rework of the Shout Out Louds' ""Impossible"", only more dramatic-- strips away all the negative lyrics, ditching a chorus of ""I'm not in love"" and instead repeating the big question: ""Are you in love?"" Well, that's a hell of a thing for a pop song to ask. The track promises dancefloor absolution, only to nag at the heart in a way the Teenagers' lame girlfriend never could. Summer always ends too soon, and before long I'm sure beachy dance music will sound as cloying as rock fans considered the Beach Boys by the late 1960s. Like Wavves in Barcelona, Delorean recognize there's a dark side to their ecstatic vision, the aching truth that utopia-- literally, ""no place""-- can never totally be fulfilled. As equally impressive bonus track ""Big Dipper"" puts it: ""Babe, if you want to we could run away up into the sun/ But we would only fade from black to black."" Delorean's similarities to other ""sunny"", ""shimmering"" new artists, ultimately, are far less important than their similarities to other practitioners of well-crafted and instantly gripping pop.","Sunny electronic euphoria has been one of the late-decade underground's richest musical nodes, and this Barcelona electro-pop put a beautiful spin on the sound.

Winter Hill,Miss Derringer,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4adb1335d7bf16989ff/1:1/w_160/6d8ad20f.jpg,2009-07-27 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13148-winter-hill/,,"The term ""dress-up"" tends to be used as a pejorative in indie circles, typically indicating an artist who seems to be reaching more than grasping. But Miss Derringer's custom duds are no more a put-on than Kings of Leon's Shaggy wardrobe or the Decemberists faux Victorian accoutrements. The L.A. band plays its parts to the hilt: A sculptor dealing in darkly whimsical phantasmagoria, singer Liz McGrath appears in a sequined baton-twirler leotard with a goth marching-band helmet and prison tattoo for the band's third and best album, Winter Hill, which is a change from the Weimar rockabilly chanteuse she played on 2006's Lullabies. Enlisting local designers like Adele Mildred and Winter Rosebudd, she's a West Coast Karen O, but aims for retro composure rather than punk disarray. The men who back her wear black as a nod to the Man in Black but accessorize like Mike Ness: matching wallet chains, western shirts, black armbands, heavy eye make-up. To their considerable credit, Miss Derringer sound exactly like they look and don't need the look to sound good. Just as they mix and match fashions, they blend country, punk, rockabilly, showtunes, cabaret, and New Wave into a surprisingly sturdy and seamless sound. With faster tempos and more pronounced hooks than their previous albums, Winter Hill is a concept album of sorts about the Irish Gang Wars of the 1960s, when the McLaughlin Gang and the Winter Hill Gang made Boston a bloody battlefield. These songs are the band's playful approximations of what might have been playing on the radio as gangsters drove to hit jobs or slumped in their seats during stakeouts. Accordingly, the band build from period-specific sounds, but it's highly unlikely-- okay, outright impossible-- that James ""Whitey"" Bulger or Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi were listening to X and Social Distortion while whacking McLaughlin soldiers or laundering money. Perhaps because Miss Derringer are enough removed in time from their music heroes, they don't have a kneejerk reverence toward Carl Perkins, Lesley Gore, or Blondie, which leaves them free to compress half a century of pop history into short, sharp, smart pop songs. On Winter Hill, Miss Derringer are witty synthesists. ""Death By Desire"" begins with a spoken-word intro and ends with some Explosions in the Sky guitars, as if girl-group drama is no different from post-rock drama. The chorus of ""Bulletproof Heart"" sounds like there's a skip in their Shangri-La's record: ""He don't! He don't! He don't!"" sings Liz McGrath, and you expect her to continue with ""hang around with the gang no more!"" Likewise, ""Drop Shot Dead"", one of the few songs to explicitly address the gang wars, (mis)quotes Roy Orbison. ""I close my eyes/ And I dream away,"" McGrath sings with a sly hiccup in her voice, before the song rockets into a surf-guitar chorus that's one of the catchiest and most undeniable hooks on the album. In fact, the fashion is inseparable from the music, not just as another manifestation of their influences but as an emotional scrim. Despite its period trappings, Winter Hill is a heavy, dark, and desperate album, and songs like ""Mausoleum"" and ""Heartbreaks & Razorblades"" have real emotional stakes. Consider the opening lines of ""Heartbreaks & Razorblades"", which McGrath sings with only a spare guitar for accompaniment: ""We found him late last night/ Lying on his side/ With a note by his side/ And I try to block the sight from my mind."" She makes it a very real moment, cutting through the sequins and make-up to invest those lines with a sense of real loss*. Winter Hill* thrums with chilly heartbreak that belies the liberties Miss Derringer take with traditions and influences, as if the only way they could address subjects so raw and painful is with lots of eyeliner.","Led by singer/sculptor Liz McGrath, this L.A. band blendsÂ country, punk, rockabilly, showtunes, and cabaret into a surprisingly sturdy sound.

He Was King,Felix Da Housecat,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53db1335d7bf1698b59/1:1/w_160/f7b526bc.jpg,2009-07-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13276-he-was-king/,Nettwerk,"Felix da Housecat was unlucky enough to release his biggest hit at the height of one of the more ignoble fads in dance music's recent history. But Felix's ""Silver Screen Shower Scene"" sounds as good now as in the days of electroclash for one simple reason: His teenage training cutting tough-as-nails jack fodder for post-Frankie Knuckles Chicagoans meant ""Silver Screen"" felt honestly tough, rather than the feigned brutalism of those who wouldn't come within spitting distance of either gabba or a gospel a cappella. It's tempting to say that Felix's music has been progressively less interesting as the decade's worn on because he refuses to let go of the context that briefly made him a pan-genre star. He Was King was described in the advance press as an ""electronic pop"" record, but Felix was never particularly good at ""pop,"" while he positively fucking excelled at floor-ready craziness without much chance of crossing over. Like his track-happy peers in the Relief/Cajual era, Felix would have been barred from the Brill Building, but you also suspect he wouldn't have cared. And as for his later career, well, it was easy to look like Phil friggin' Spector when your competition was Avenue D. So unlike, say, Basement Jaxx, Felix's pop moves have never been material you could debut straight-faced at an acoustic open mic. Even the Jaxx's lesser songs have a distinct personality, whereas Felix's attempts at trad catchiness sound like the anemic approximations of someone who stopped listening to the radio on Dec. 31, 1989, and forgot what was so good about the era in the interim.Â Take album opener ""We All Wanna Be Prince"", whose main crime is not its blatancy (kinda signposted by the title) but how enervated its pastiche sounds. Prince had no shortage of imitators when he was at the top, either. And in both eras, those who ripped him off knew to swipe some of his songwriting mojo, rather than just the lame sonic signifiers that scream ""PRINCE"" in 40-foot high purple letters and offer nothing on the second listen. ""We All Wanna Be Prince"" is so stagnant and obvious that you keep waiting for some conceptual punchline only to walk away with the dead air greeting a joke that fell on its face. Most of the tracks you suspect Felix thinks are capital-p pop likewise toe the ""joke or not?"" line warily, from the titles on down. ""Turn Me on a Summer Smile"" would be a little cringeworthy even if we were trawling through demos fished from the dumpster behind an apartment-run twee label. But at least it fits the song's cut-rate Saint Etienne pastiche. Anyone who claims Sarah Cracknell lacks vocal personality will sigh at the off-the-rack girly club vocals all over He Was King. But ""Spank U Very Much"" is the kind of entendre-flaying pun guys banging out identikit hi-nrg remixes would roll their bloodshot eyes over. Felix has never been afraid to be gaudy, whether good (the no-excuses O.T.T. house of his early days) or really, really bad (the avert-your-eyes cover art for 2004's Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever). But the endless sing-songy chorus substituting for anything like structure, and the generic ""pop made with keyboards"" backing, means ""Spank U"" flops square in ""eh"" territory. Like so much of He Was King ""Spank U"" can't even be bothered to poke the ass-end of awfulness in your eye, doubly sad when that lack of shame is generally a good thing when it comes to house music. This is, after all, a genre whose populist end has thrived for two decades on some pretty questionable purloined bubblegum hooks. So why do those 4/4 remixes of hardcore chart cheese work better than, say, Felix's ""Do We Move Your World"", a song so clearly aiming for that kind of ear-worm-plus-club-rhythm two-for-one value? Oh, right, because they had their start as pop songs, a venue where you go hard with your hooks or you stay home. The subtle shimmer of ""We"" is the about the only time this slightness feels like choice rather than necessity. And here's the real rub: When Felix stays fierce, instrumental, and near-abrasive, the album scrapes greatness. ""Elvi$"" and ""LA Ravers"" are both no-bullshit house tracks, the former with a great rapper-with-the-hiccups electro break and the latter with some knuckle-dusting riffage that's a reminder of why we also continuing listening to Vitalic when we've recycle-binned our Fischerspooner collection. And the titular boing on ""Kickdrum"" is so big and baldly boorish it's like some Rotterdam raver flew one of the ladies of the Human League over for a one-off collaboration. Unfortunately a whole album of similarly DJ-pitched material, all the quote-unquote pop frills shaved off, wouldn't have allowed blog readers to devote the few days their attenuated attentions can muster for He Was King's singles, before the next this-is-kind-of-okay-I-guess electro-pop album arrives to distract them.","Still messing with electro-pop when his strengths so obviously lie in tracky house, Felix da Housecat returns with his first LP in five years.

Seya,Oumou SangarÃ©,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57f13d1975652138f85/1:1/w_160/3ce9cf49.jpg,2009-07-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13330-seya/,NonesuchWorld Circuit,"Oumou SangarÃ© was born in 1968, and she was an acclaimed singer by the end of 1973. Today, SangarÃ© is an elder stateswoman of Malian music, in particular the updated pop descendants of the traditional hunting songs of the Wassoulou region. She is immensely popular in her homeland-- her 1989 debut album, Moussoulou (""Women""), sold an astonishing 250,000 official copies, mostly in Africa, where bootleg cassettes account for an enormous percentage of sales. She's earned her place among West Africa's musical elite, and Seya should solidify her place abroad as well, with its seamless mix of old and new sounds that give her an arresting, sometimes haunting backdrop for her confident vocals and activist lyrics, sung in several languages. SangarÃ© gets a hand from a whopping 47 collaborators on the album, including master guitarist Djelimady Tounkara, Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and Tony Allen. Most appear on a track or two, and mixed in with all the electric guitar, bass, flute, sax, and trap drums are a host of traditional Malian instruments, including the ngoni (a cousin of the guitar and banjo), the balafon (a type of marimba), and an arsenal of drums and percussion that give the album a diverse and always interesting rhythmic base. It opens with a blast of rhythmic balafon and dives into a fractured groove topped with an arcing flute, as SangarÃ© sings a forceful appeal for women's equality in society and the home. Women's rights are an issue she's built her public life and much of her music around, and it's a theme that crops up across the album. ""Wele Wele Wintou"" sets dark female harmonies against a sharp sax theme behind SangarÃ©'s rapid-fire vocal, which speaks out against forced marriage. Subtle wah guitar burbles through the verses, and Tounkara takes one of the most unusual solos I've heard, playing far down the neck with a dark, blunt tone. You could probably listen to just the instrumental backing tracks to most of these songs and come away satisfied by the richness of the interlocking rhythms and the subtle harmonic shifts. Even slow tracks like ""Senkele Te Sira"", which features another brilliant guitar part from Tounkara, have a dynamic, vibrant character that perfectly matches SangarÃ©'s sometimes towering vocals. She knows how to accent a phrase, unleashing a powerful wail at key moments to drive home a thought in a way that makes her passion clear in any language.","Elder stateswoman of Malian music is joined by 47 collaborators who provide a seamless mix of old and new sounds for her confident vocals and activist lyrics.

Blue Roses,Blue Roses,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5855e6ef95969320b07/1:1/w_160/9c492a84.jpg,2009-07-27 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13335-blue-roses/,XL,"The self-titled debut from 21-year-old British songwriter Laura Groves, under the name Blue Roses, thrives on the romance of youth and the unknown. On opener ""Greatest Thoughts"", for instance, Groves suffers her adoration for the lover who won't meet her in the middle and, even worse, will never actually understand her. But she's willing to forfeit just a bit of her young life to give him a chance: ""You pulled me closer to your chest/ You were the one that I liked best,"" she rhymes simply, her bracing voice whispering above a romantic piano line that recalls Claude Debussy. And over the steadily building waves of acoustic guitar that shape ""Coast"", Groves sings of escaping to the ""coast of the East of England."" Confident in the immortality afforded by youth and love, she wants to stare into the danger of the storms moving in from the sea-- with him. ""I think that he and I will be saved,"" she sings, harmonizing the high notes herself. Indeed, the bulk of Blue Roses is a call to turn one's beliefs over to feelings and intuition, even if it results in the sort of somber, sobering imperative that ends this album: ""You're better off leaving/ Just go in the night."" For Groves, life's more about invigorating highs and lows than the inevitable crash that follows. These lyrical patterns fit the 10 songs that comprise Blue Roses, a mostly solo album played almost entirely by Groves and recorded by friends in several English homes. Even though youth sometimes overcomes her taste here, she's adventurous and confident, executing grand musical gestures without hesitation. To wit, the opening triptych is as brazen an introduction to a new songwriter, singer, arranger, and performer as I can recall. Groves is as comfortable with the soft, solitary coo that begins ""Greatest Thoughts"" as she is with the crisscrossed-and-stacked harmonies that bloom at its middle. She swings between the strident flair of Joanna Newsom and the broad mellifluence of Antony at will, and her versatility continually renews interest. The album's best moment-- the brilliant second tune, ""Cover Your Tracks""-- even bends time. With its dizzying succession of parts, it feels like 15 minutes' worth of ideas crammed into a potential radio hit. And Groves' ideas-- from guitar finger-picking to an exultant choir that splits the song's calm surface-- suggest we're not witnessing someone who treats her songs casually. Having nothing and everything to prove at once, Groves infuses tunes that seem naively simple on paper, like the coming-of-resilience mantra and third track ""I Am Leaving"", with floods of conflicting elements. Analog keyboards and accordion, digital distortion and glockenspiel: They all lift the song's lilting acoustic guitar, effectively transforming it from a ditty into a statement. Over these 45 minutes, though, that saturated aesthetic sometimes drowns itself. Groves doesn't yet posses the wisdom of restraint, at least not consistently. Sure, ""Rebecca"" begins with a spare electric guitar line and her lonely voice, and closer ""Imaginary Flights"" begins with an elegant piano dirge. But, like their counterparts, these tunes inevitably swell, suffocating Groves' occasionally masterful use of dynamics with too many of them. She doesn't step away from the flourishes to let the song breathe, and she only rarely lets the music communicate the story apart from the words and her voice. It's like watching two great movies on a split-screen television: Sometimes, one needs to be paused so that the other can make sense. This idea works in the hands of masters like Sufjan Stevens (in spite of his vainglory and gimmicks) and Jim O'Rourke (in spite of his, you know, aloofness). Groves isn't there yet. But I'm more than willing to eat these words soon: Blue Roses makes it clear that Groves is inordinately talented and working with big portions of audacity and acumen. It's the sort of debut that puts Groves in the company of recent giants, both with its dramatic compositional flair (again, Joanna Newsom) and in its mix of homemade humility and major accomplishment. Add Blue Roses to the recent list of Bon Iver, Adem Ilhan, and Peter Broderick-- smart songwriters with the vision and wherewithal to do succeed, for the most part, by themselves.","The self-titled debut from 21-year-old British songwriter Laura Groves, under the name Blue Roses, thrives on the romance of youth and the unknown.

L.A. EP 3 X 3,Flying Lotus,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a578ea9e61561daa5145/1:1/w_160/8a72e46a.jpg,2009-07-27 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13325-la-ep-3-x-3/,Warp,"Around the time he released Los Angeles, I arranged an interview with Steven Ellison aka Flying Lotus. I tried for weeks to get hold of him, bent my own schedule around his; when we finally got on the horn, he was in a loud airport and seemed uninterested in talking to some random dude about J Dilla or his process. The connection was shaky anyway, so we just aborted the thing. As frustrating as that was for me and my editors, it gave me a better understanding-- and weirdly, respect-- for Ellison as a musician. Here was a guy concerned only with the making of beats and none of the attendant PR bullshit that accompanies being a hotshot producer. That was about a year ago, and since then Ellison's single-mindedness has paid off, manifesting itself in the creation of his own new imprint, Brainfeeder, and no less than five albums of fresh or remixed material, most notably a triptych of EPs reimagining tracks from 2008's Los Angeles. The last in the series, L.A. EP 3 X 3, is also the most intriguing, a seven-track suite that features two new songs and a handful of bold recontextualizations (they're more than remixes, really) from friends and fellow leftfield beatmakers from his homebase of L.A. and abroad. It's not surprising that Ellison would conceive a piece like this, since so much of his music relies on the deconstruction and re-configuration of sounds and ideas. The difference here is he's allowing others to do the same with his own material. Remarkably, much ofÂ L.A. EP 3 X 3 differs in style and tone from Ellison's previous beat-centric work, which is known for retaining a soulfulness amid its often complex, propulsive arrangements. Here, in place of the spliced-up Dillaisms of Los Angeles and his lesser known, but equally strong 1983, Ellison offers a textural ambient piece, music that falls somewhere between the electro-drone of Canadian composer Tim Hecker and the Eastern-tinged blissfulness of Rounds-era Four Tet. Considering that most electronic-music producers take years to develop a singular style, it's no small feat for FlyLo to try on an alternate genre and mostly pull it off. His two original contributions to the album, the appropriately titled ""Endless White"" and ""Spin Cycles"", are most notable for showcasing that rare flexibility. The former is one of the record's standouts, where an undulating synth groan is set aflutter by distant bird chirps and ethereal vocal samples drifting in and out of the mix. ""Spin Cycles"" has a similar, though slightly more distorted feel. In it, a crowd of voices is processed into one, creating an unsettling group chant that FlyLo embellishes with bits of harp strumming and wonky analog bits. L.A. EP 3 X 3's remaining tracks, all handled in some way by other artists, share these songs' ghostly qualities. Most of the guests here are affiliated with Ellison in some way, friends from a loose L.A. beat collective who share his weeded-out, future-forward aesthetic. If their remixes don't always improve upon the original tracks, they at least push the source material in compelling new directions. Dimlite (nÃ© Dimitri Grimm), a downtempo specialist who records for Sonar Kollektiv, reimagines Los Angeles' spare vocal closer ""Infinitum"" as a haunted, buzzing atmospheric number, with heavy Sunn O)))-style guitars and asymmetrical drumbeats filling out the arrangement. UK dubstep dude Breakage, the lone international contributor here, takes a similar course on his shoegaze-y ""Bill's Suit Mix"" of ""Testament"" and manages the best track of the bunch. He turns the breezy original into something fierce and ominous, stirring in angelic female vocals to soften his walls of guitar noise and storm-a-brewing drums. Probably the most impressive thing about L.A. EP 3 X 3 is that, despite its many cooks in the kitchen, the record feels remarkably cohesive-- almost like the well-thought-out work of one artist. The intricate strings from harpist Rebekah Raff's ""Auntie's Harp Remix"" echo through FlyLo's ""Spin Cycles"", the droning elements from ""Endless White"" spill over into Take's clattering re-do of ""Parisian Goldfish"", and tiny pieces of tracks seem to reappear in others. The songs bleed into one another naturally and exist more as an album than a remix collection, which is an achievement in its own right. But more than that, L.A. EP 3 X 3 shows an exciting new side of Ellison, a producer who seems to be getting better as he progresses. We'll have to wait to find out how these new ideas coalesce on his next full-length, but if this album's any indication, we might be treated to something altogether different.","Third EP reimagining Los Angeles tracks is the most intriguing, a seven-track suite featuring two new songs and a handful of bold recontextualizations.

Local Flavor,Blues Control,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a539c0084474cd0c0689/1:1/w_160/27bf091a.jpg,2009-07-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13272-local-flavor/,Siltbreeze,"One of the many scuzzy-sounding bands toiling in and around New York City at the moment, Blues Control is the Queens-based duo of Russ Waterhouse and Lea Cho. Unlike most of their peers operating in some form of lo-fi punk, Blues Control have their sights on a more expansive sound, a kind of homespun blend of instrumental, machine-tinged psychedelic rock. Though stylistically dissimilar, they do share these acts' affinity for stripped-down, hissy sonics, making the band a sensible fit at boutique noise-pop imprint Siltbreeze. Local Flavor, their second full-length and first for the label, is an ambitious offering, a half-hour ride through murky textures built from electronics and traditional instrumentation. Blues Control are not a pop band (far from it, in fact), and they don't seem especially concerned about hooks or melody. While the four songs on Local Flavor-- which strung together, comprise one gradually expanding instrumental piece-- may not find much of an audience outside of committed fans of noise and drone, the album's grainy assemblage of submerged mood music could represent a welcome addition to the latter's record collection. Local Flavor's tracks are built simply, usually on a foundation of Cho's keyboards or a modest drum-machine pitter-patter, on top of which Waterhouse embellishes with expressive guitar playing and additional electronics. With trumpet assistance from recent It Guy Kurt Vile, opener ""Good Morning"" is the most straightforward track, a lo-fi reimagining of the sludgy psych-rock perfected by Californians Comets on Fire, but it's the slower, dub-tinged pieces here that work best. The album's two best cuts are its last-- the gurgling ""Tangier"" and extended outro ""On Through the Night""-- and on these Cho and Waterhouse home in on a dark, disquieting tone. Here, the music sounds like it's bubbling up from and evil underground, a burial place that holds the secrets of past atrocities. Though they succeed in sketching these gloomy portraits, there's a detachment about these songs that feels at odds with their other aim, which is creating a feeling of druggy ambience. The best ambient music envelops its listener, and Local Flavor ultimately lacks that sense of inhabitability. (I will say that I find this true of most guitar acts attempting a similar style; this music is difficult to build organically-- part of the reason so many of the finest ambient records are electronic.) It does seem Blues Control might benefit from grander sonics, since it's even harder to make something truly hum out of basic instrumentation. Still, in a scene with too much overlap, one has to commend the band for working far outside the status quo, even if Local Flavor feels like an album that a few will love and a larger majority will find head-scratchingly opaque.","Though they are on the garage-rock-leaning Siltbreeze imprint, Blues Control opt for a more expansive blend of instrumental, machine-tinged psychedelic rock.

Whether a self-fulfilling prophecy or the product of title-driven priming, then, this Portland by way of Alaska band has now released four albums and four EPs of ambitious yet friendly, pristine and proggish indie pop since 2006. 2007's 10-track EP It's Complicated Being a Wizard, for instance, opened with a 23-minute opus, followed by that same piece broken up into nine sections. Accessibility and a vague gloss of concept comprise The Satanic Satanist, on which the band, already tailor-cut for indie approval, seems to throw everything on the table to make a groovy album with wide appeal. Satanist isn't necessarily thrilling, but within the tighter parameters the band set for itself, the group has succeeded at making a good-old-fashioned classic rock record. Song lengths stay around the three-minute mark, the production quality gleams, every hook feels anthemic, and the whole thing is permeated by themes of nostalgia, nature, and togetherness (man). I could dive into the lyrics and try to delineate some sort of binding narrative to the work, but the album doesn't seem to want me to (nor do you). The best quality of Satanist is that everything sits right on the surface, from the opening rally cry of ""People Say"" (""What a lovely day yeah we won the war/ May have lost a million men, but we got a million more"") through the hyperactive bongo/wah-wah work on ""Lovers in Love"" and the would-be hippie anthems ""Everyone is Golden"" and ""The Sun"" (""we are all just lovers""!). Binding the whole piece more than even the cross-faded tracks is the limber, occasionally awesome voice of singer-songwriter John Baldwin Gourley, which can hop north into a crystal falsetto, or drop down into a soulful moan at a second's notice. While the deal Portugal. The Man made with Satanist doesen't quite qualify as a Pyrrhic victory, it does raise an important, evergreen question about sacrifices. Compromises, more specifically: the sort that bands now and then make with the goal of accessing more ears.  Is it better to release more ""challenging"" music and risk remaining largely unknown, or strive toward ""pop"" record, maybe gain a few new fans, but risk sacrificing a lot of what makes your band unique? These guys have balanced eccentricity and pop savvy since they started, and Satanist is the first record where it seems they've thrown their weight toward the latter. And while it's certainly enjoyable, it's also a bit more generic than anything they've done before. Maybe their own philosophy can be used to explain my point better: If, as they assert, ""Everyone Is Golden"", doesn't that sort of devalue gold?","After four albums and four EPs ofÂ ambitious yet friendly, pristine and proggish indie pop since 2006, this oddly named band steps into the spotlight.

Confiote de Bits: A Remix Collection,PÃ©pÃ© Bradock,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53aea9e61561daa50b2/1:1/w_160/edb849c6.jpg,2009-07-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13273-confiote-de-bits-a-remix-collection/,BBE,"PÃ©pÃ© Bradock's Confiote de Bits, a 2xCD collection of the French house musician's remixes from the past decade, couldn't have come at a better time. Deep house is in vogue everywhere from American indie dance, where DFA acts routinely invoke Chicago and New York's house originators, to European clubs, where moody chords and jacking grooves have dethroned minimal techno. Bradock, meanwhile, remains sorely under-recognized and underrated, despite his roots within the same scene that gave the world Daft Punk and Cassius. It's a pleasure and a public service to finally have the bulk of his remixes, most of them vinyl-only and long out of print, collected in one place. More importantly, the album confirms Bradock as one of house music's most inspired and most uncompromising producers. This is, after all, the artist responsible for ""Rhapsody in Pain"", a 2007 track pairing a bouncy, lighthearted melody with a gruesome chorus of shrieks and moans. Rarely has feel-good dance music been quite so unsettling. But rarely are his productions are so confrontational, either. In fact, with his predilection for laid-back tempos, aquamarine chords, disco detailing, and full-throated vocals, Bradock's music puts a premium on pleasure-- but there's almost always something slightly ""off"" about his work. Just listen to his 2002 remix of Iz & Diz's ""Mouth"", which opens the collection. Bradock sticks with the original song's principal conceit, using hiccupping vocal samples (and nothing else) to mimic house music's machine cadences; atop that base, he lays down an airy cushion of barbershop harmonies and sampled scat singing. There's even a kazoo solo, or something like one. But where a lesser artist would have stopped at the clever sound design, Bradock puts it all in service of something ambitiously musical, with unusually voiced chords and odd twists and turns suggesting both the manic whimsy of Raymond Scott and the angelic bent of Grizzly Bear. Bradock is a genius arranger. His 2008 remix of International Pony's ""Bubble in the Bottle"" should be required listening for a generation of producers across house, minimal, disco and electro who think that it's enough to juggle a handful of loops for eight minutes, and call it a track. The ""Happy Zumbi"" remix of ""Bubble"" is minimalistic filter disco at heart, just a lone set of chords and a cacophonous percussion pattern. (Aside from a brief, treated snippet of Snax and Khan's vocals, it bears almost no relation to the original song.) But across just under seven minutes, he puts the thing through its paces, sculpting broad hills and dells out of the filters and levels, and sending squealing oscillators and ramshackle percussive fills flying overhead like unkempt crows. Every element is always in motion-- rising, falling, morphing, turning inside out-- but it never feels busy, and never distracts from the track's graceful arc. However he's picked his commissions, Bradock has kept curious company. Icons like Cesaria Evora and Roy Ayers share space here with names like Incognito, Zero 7, Chateau Flight, and Pete Namlook, drawing a map of 1990s/00s electronic music that runs from world fusion to deep house to middlebrow downtempo. Judging by the tracklisting, it looks schizo at best and mercenary at worst. But for all the disparity of the source material and the range of sounds, ideas, and moods achieved in the remixes, the reworks all point to a unifying aesthetic. How to describe it? The phrase ""deep burnt""-- also, incidentally, the title of a 1999 Bradock tune-- might suffice. Jazzy augmented chords and skipping grooves are torn straight from the deep house textbook, but there's something deliciously charred about it all. Drum samples and synthesizers swim in a fizz of distortion. Voices double and dub into a fog of echo. Melodies aren't so much played as splashed on in broad, energetic strokes; samples are daubed atop one another in haphazard, slapdash fashion. Both his textures and his collage sensibility recall Robert Rauschenberg. Everywhere you listen, odd sonics clump like sand in drying paint, while errant electronic noises go careening beyond the limits of the canvas and the frame. If Bradock is less well known than, say, DJ Koze, another musician who has used remixes as a springboard for his own idiosyncratic style, that's at least partly Bradock's doing. He has never hidden behind a scrim of anonymity, but he's never exactly courted attention, either. His remixes far outnumber his original productions, the bulk of which have appeared only on his own, vinyl-only label, Atavisme. And despite the high profile of his commissions, I daresay that the cavalier weirdness of his approach hasn't inspired many average Zero 7 fans to delve further into his catalog. But Confiote de Bits shows the remixes to be far more than merely a footnote to Bradock's recording career. Almost two hours long, the collection still holds together as coherently as many artist albums, testifying to the strength of Bradock's voice and vision over the past decade and more. These tracks are so full of spirit and ideas that, taken together, Confiote de Bits is practically an embarrassment of riches-- though the only ones blushing should be the musicians who have taken ""deep house"" as a model simply to be remade in its own image, over and over. In Bradock's house, the doors and windows are thrown wide open, with gusts of wind left to remodel at their leisure.","This 2xCD collection of the French house musician's remixes from the past decade couldn't have come at a better time.

"White Ink, Black Ink",Wheat,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4abb1335d7bf16989fa/1:1/w_160/4ab42ee0.jpg,2009-07-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13146-white-ink-black-ink/,Rebel Group,"Wheat are more about flux than stasis. Since releasing its first album in 1998, the Massachusetts group has been tinkering restlessly with its sound and lineup to the degree that each new album heralds a new approach and a new band. As a result, there is no straight line of development from Wheat's debut through their most recent efforts, but rather a jagged trajectory tracing their exploration of the frayed edges of pop songcraft. So it's no surprise that their fifth full-length, White Ink, Black Ink, proves so markedly different from 2007's Every Day I Said a Prayer for Kathy and Made a One Inch Square, just as that album was worlds removed from its predecessor, 2003's Per Second Per Second Per Second... Every Second, whose streamlined sound made it a fan favorite. If the sonic contortions of One Inch Square lost the band some listeners (especially after a four-year wait), then White Ink, Black Ink might bring them back: It may not be start-to-finish consistent, but it is much more focused and straightforward. Singer Scott Levesque and drummer Brendan Harney-- who switch up instruments often enough that those titles are almost meaningless-- emphasize rhythm and texture on these songs, which gives the album a straight through-line that suggests the pop sensibility of Per Second sucked through the clatter of One Inch Square. Opener ""H.O.T.T."" layers several live and programmed beats over each other to create a strange and steady groove that plays up Levesque's all-chorus songwriting even as it acknowledges that the band's ever-changing sound may alienate some listeners: ""Half of the time I feel broke, cracked, peeled, weathered,"" Levesque sings. ""Half of the time I feel shiny and new."" ""Changes Is"" similarly emphasizes forward motion and Levesque's self-commentary, fashioning a statement on the band's mercurial nature into the album's catchiest hook and bounciest beat. ""I Want Less"" rallies around quick bursts of snare drum hits and high-hat clicks, as if Harney were playing each part of his drum kit separately, yet that sound gathers unexpected momentum as it pushes the song along at a weird clip. Wheat may sound more direct here, but never predictable. ""My Warning Song"" sets up a series of seemingly unconnected elements-- a continually unfolding guitar riff, a choir, a simple drum tattoo, Levesque singing, ""Everything is going to be alright,"" over and over-- yet their modularity is the point, and in the end they all cohere into one of the best and most naturally dramatic moments on the album. Levesque and Harney repeat no trick on White Ink, Black Ink, no matter how well it may work the first time around. That reluctance to linger makes for a concise album, and part of the album's appeal is hearing them find new ways to sound like themselves. These songs are dense with ideas, some intriguing and others not so much. The thirty-second ""Coke and Tanqueray"", for example, aims for the evocative brevity of a haiku, but sounds more like a wisp of a breeze of a song. Closer ""Baby in My Way"" opens with Levesque singing excitedly over a simple piano theme, creating a nicely spare moment that lets the album exhale a bit, but it soon settles into a string section before fading out prematurely, ending the album on a puzzling but not unpleasant note. Wheat flirt with cursoriness on White Ink, Black Ink, which seems overly compact at times, but they've come back around to the simple pleasures of verses and choruses-- and sound all the better for it.","After more than a decade, Wheat continue to exploreÂ the frayed edges of pop songcraft.

"Gather, Form & Fly",Megafaun,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5029d034d5c69bf31cf/1:1/w_160/abf6315e.jpg,2009-07-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13223-gather-form-fly/,Hometapes,"""Plant that flag on solid ground,"" advise the members of Megafaun on their second album, Gather, Form & Fly. The trio-- comprised of brothers Brad and Phil Cook and Joe Westerlund-- sing that admonition repeatedly, in boisterous unison, yet they have no intention of taking such advice, at least not musically. In fact, since the disbanding of their previous band DeYarmond Edison (with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon), they have celebrated the joys of shaky foundations, creating ingeniously ramshackle folk rock that combines acoustic instruments and mountain harmonies with obtuse sound collages, meandering song structures, and abstract passages featuring the most psychedelic banjo imaginable. As if to illustrate this point, they've even designed the album cover so that it works either as a square or as a diamond, the subtle shift of landscape revealing new ambiguities. ""Solid Ground"" kicks off with a dirty guitar riff and a walking bass line, unfolding as a formally repetitive blues. This type of structure-- the same line three times, followed by a new fourth line-- is perhaps the most solid ground in rock, yet Megafaun make it slippery by adding a squealing solo whose feedback emanates not from a guitar, but from a closely mic'ed blues harmonica. Near the end, the casual midtempo groove threatens to fall apart as the instruments break stride, but Megafaun manage to keep it together. Averse to predictability and sentimentality, the band is restless with established forms, yet instead of subverting blues and folk traditions, they upend them. Their ends are deconstructive, not destructive. This tendency, however, made their 2008 debut, Bury the Square, sound frustratingly divided, as if the band's divergent musical urges had been compartmentalized and overthought. It was as though they had all the pieces, but were unsure how to fit them together. Gather, Form & Fly improves dramatically on that release, integrating musical styles more organically and confidently to play up the contrasts between them. ""Solid Ground"" segues seamlessly into the mÃºm-like ""Darkest Hour"", which turns water droplets into a rudimentary melody before morphing into waves crashing on a beach and finally settling into a thunderstorm backdrop for splices of a hymnal roundelay. Similarly, ""Impressions of the Past"" begins with a shuffling intro that never coalesces into a vocal-based song. Instead, it's 10 or 12 different songs before the vocals enter in the final minutes, and even then, they sound like just another instrument in the mix. The song doesn't present a fully formed memory but, as its title suggests, a series of memory traces-- brief, bittersweet, and impossible to hang on to. Megafaun's songs change shape constantly-- a thrillingly mercurial quality that makes Gather, Form & Fly a headily absorbing, occasionally unsettling listen. Despite their musical wanderlust, the trio remain firmly rooted in the Appalachian foothills, enamored with folk traditions and pastoral airs. The album opens with ""Bella Marie"", a gossamer overture featuring guitar, piano, and a violin so closely mic'ed you can hear the friction of the bow on strings. Joe Westerlund's clattery percussion on ""The Process"" can't disguise its chicken-coop soul, and Christy Smith, of Nola, North Carolina's the Tender Fruit, duets on ""The Longest Day"", a delicate country number that floats along on tender banjo and guitar strums. The buoyant melody of ""The Fade"", perhaps the most instantly accessible song here, recalls locals the Kingsbury Manx as the Cook brothers sing about the death of their grandfather and the tragic shortcomings of memory: ""It's been a year,"" they sing together, ""and now I fear the fade is on."" (Trivia: That's him on the CD and etched into side four of the vinyl.) Moments like that lend Gather, Form & Fly its warmth and accessibility, despite the intentionally shaky foundations of songs like ""Guns"", which begins with one of their best moments: ""All we'll ever be, all we'll ever need,"" the trio sing together, with a mix of triumph and forlornness, before ominous rumblings dislodge their vocals from the emphatic guitar strums and drown them all in gentle noise. Rather than blanch the song of its momentousness, that spectral coda makes it all the more meaningful, as if they've just stepped from a sunlit clearing into dark woods. While some listeners may grow weary of such insistent drones, and while it's tempting to read these tendencies as opposite extremes, ultimately there are no simple dichotomies in these songs, no easy distinctions between written and improvised, concrete and fluid, organic and synthetic. All the sounds and ideas emanate from the same sources and desires, and the prismatic contrasts between them illuminate this intriguing and heartfelt album.","Former bandmates of Bon Iver continue to impress on this, their second album ofÂ ingeniously ramshackle folk rock.

Eugene McGuinness,Eugene McGuinness,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4725e6ef95969320892/1:1/w_160/0f773ace.jpg,2009-07-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13100-eugene-mcguinness/,Domino,"On his 2007 mini-album The Early Learnings of Eugene McGuinness, the London musician sang catchy-as-hell songs about videogames, crushes, imaginary monsters, and the concomitant glee and panic of being a little kid lost in the supermarket. Full of crackling pop-rocks and snapping bottle caps, McGuinness' debut was an irresistible, effervescent piece of juvenilia. A couple of critical years later and he's graduated to more mature themes: sex, love, work, God, old movies, outer space, circuses... well, some of them are more mature, anyway. His songwriting, however, hasn't really made the same incremental progress. The fresh-scrubbed but worldly wise McGuinness on the cover of his self-titled debut resembles a young John Lennon. But the 22-year old loosely participates in a different British pop tradition-- that of showmen, storytellers, and social commentators like Ray Davies, Paul Weller, Damon Albarn, Jarvis Cocker, and Eddie Argos. It's worth emphasizing the British part of this inheritance, because its wry, witty, oft-ironic observations usually-- for whatever reason-- get lost in translation during the transatlantic crossing. McGuinness can post all the Ramones covers he wants on his MySpace page, but with his logorrheic wordplay, Vaudevillian sensibility, and distinctly English inflection, he's about as likely to break his forebears' New World curse as Pete Doherty. Even if you're inclined toward high-street level closeups of old Blighty, songs like sashaying barroom-piano number ""Atlas"" or sticky stringed, between-the-wars throwback ""Those Old Black and White Movies Were True"" are little more than genre exercises. McGuinness packs so many retro idioms-- skiffle, Mersey beat, honky-tonk, doo-wop, even ballroom dance rhythms (not to mention the usual punk, pop, and folk conventions)-- into the album's 12 tracks, that he's more star pupil upstaging his peers at a student recital than someone you'd pay a cover charge to see. McGuinness hasn't entirely misplaced the pop gifts or snake-charming skills hinted at on Early Learnings; even if it's mostly downhill from there, the album's opening triad is clear-focused and engaging. ""Rings Around Rosa"", a short'n'sweet tribute to cradle-robbing, gets things off to a breathless start with its furious strumming and uncaged beats, followed by new-wave singalong ""Fonz"", and delightfully subversive ""Wendy Wonders"", which invites you to cha-cha with ""a fucked-up bastard, a subzero psycho"" and the girl who loves him. But even with two self-titled releases and undeniable charisma, Eugene McGuinness, the artist, is still a little undefined, an intersection of musical vectors rather than a single strong signature. Let's chalk it up to growing pains and watch how early learnings further develop into an adult style.","After a debut of irresistible juvenilia, the London musician graduates to more mature themes: sex, love, work, God.

Of the Cathmawr Yards,The Horse's Ha,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53bea9e61561daa50b5/1:1/w_160/35721862.jpg,2009-07-23 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13274-of-the-cathmawr-yards/,Hidden Agenda,"Jim Elkington and Janet Beveridge Bean have each made an adopted home of Chicago, and each has done time with the Windy City's venerable Thrill Jockey Records (Elkington with his Zincs, Bean with Freakwater, Eleventh Dream Day, and her Concertina Wire-abetted solo material), so we shouldn't be too surprised that they've paired for a project, nor that the Horse's Ha generally sounds like a jazz-inflected marriage of Freakwater's lonesome alt-country and the Zincs' skewed English folk stylings. What's more surprising is how mixed the results collected on debut offering Of the Cathmawr Yards-- recorded in large part by Icy Demons' Griffin ""Blue Hawaii"" Rodriguez-- can sometimes be. When Elkington, Bean, and their three Chicago hired guns (cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm, bassist Nick Macri, and drummer Charles Rumback) are on, they're on, and when they're not, well, it can get cloying. With its lively rhythm section, lush string-playing, and exquisite pacing, ""Asleep in a Waterfall"" falls squarely in the former camp; a summation of the band's strengths and a harbinger of the good things to come on the record's second half. Notably, Bean gets the lead vocal here, with chief lyricist Elkington joining her in harmony for the choruses (more often on Cathmawr Yards it's the other way around). As anyone who has listened to the Zincs can attest, Elkington's lyrics can tend toward the weighty, and letting Bean's lithe voice sing them is one way to counteract this. After slumping for a couple of tracks, Yards picks up again with instrumental ""Liberation"", which sounds like Tortoise traded the cocktail lounge for the front porch and went acoustic. ""The Piss Choir"" keeps the momentum going as the band loosens up, lights up, and jams out, culminating in a delirious dance between Elkington's guitar and Lonberg-Holm's strings. Vocal interplay takes a more interesting turn here as well, with Bean first echoing Elkington's lines, then joining him, both singers sumptuously stretching their syllables. It's pretty smooth sailing from there, right on through the slightly spooky clip-clop of ""Rising Moon"" (the only Bean composition on the record) and barnstorming finale ""Map of Stars"", where noted improvisor Fred Lonberg-Holm gets a chance to just let it rip on the cello. Suddenly a record with a mostly inauspicious start has gone out with a bang that won't soon be forgotten. Catamawr Yards, then, gets better as it gets more adventurous, and it gets more adventurous as it leans more on that backing band. When that's not the case, things can drag, as on ""Wilds Empty Bedroom"". Subsequent track ""Left Hand"" falls into the same plodding tempo trap, salvaged only by Rumback's percussion touch and a guest jazz trumpet bit courtesy of Calexico's Martin Wenk. Indeed, the drumming on this record deserves special mention, and hats should be tipped both to Rumback and Rodriguez for creating and capturing a dynamic percussive sound that goes a long way to distinguish Cathmawr Yards from any number of whisky-soaked, overimaginative acoustic records out there. Instead, the Horse's Ha's post-folk feels right at home amid the legacy of Chicago sonics as innovative as they are pleasing to the ear.","Members of Freakwater and the Zincs team for a record that builds on the Windy City's legacy of alt-country, skewed folk, and jazz hybridization.

Radio Wars,Howling Bells,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5415e6ef95969320a6d/1:1/w_160/4ccbeb93.jpg,2009-07-23 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13278-radio-wars/,Independiente,"""Radio wars are coming,"" London-via-Sydney quartet Howling Bells harmonize halfway through their second album and first in three years, Radio Wars. ""They're here."" While it's not entirely clear what they're on about, there's little doubting that whatever form these radio wars may take, Howling Bells are ready for them. They've just come off a high-profile tour with Coldplay and Snow Patrol, they've got a couple of new videos in the can, and they've chiseled their agreeable sound into the 10 exquisitely produced tracks that comprise Wars; it's telling also that while the Bells' self-titled debut featured a nondescript and utterly forgettable grayscale collage on its cover, the new one puts portraits of the band members front and center (it doesn't hurt any that they're all easy on the eyes). Stylistically, Radio Wars represents a move away from the occasional organ and twang that gave these guys their previous country-noir tag, and finds them dabbling in keyboard-saturated textures and leaning a little more on their 1980s influences. It's still a tad dark, but more the dark of shadows and clouds and thunderstorms than of pitch black night. The LP offers a formidable opening volley in the form of first track ""Treasure Hunt"", which springs right out of the stereo on a wave of ""bah-bah""s, sci-fi sounds, and ""How Soon Is Now?""-esque helicopter-blade-swirl guitar, never losing its impulse. ""Into the Chaos"" and single ""Cities Burning Down"" emerge as the other standouts here, both crisp, competent, cleanly-structured jams, though neither is nearly as dangerous as its name would have you think. The sugary sweet ""Let's Be Kids"", meanwhile, easily wins the prize for Track Most Likely to Make It Into AIM Away Messages, Facebook Status Updates, and Teen Television Drama Montage Sequences, even if its return-to-innocence sloganeering (""Let's be kids again/ Life was so simple then,"" goes the chorus) is a curious sentiment coming from a band so polished, professional, and, yes, grown up. As for everything else, well... again, it's an agreeable sound the Bells have hit upon, and that makes for an agreeable listen throughout. Plenty of bands have done far worse. Howling Bells was a very agreeable record too, though, and Wars doesn't really improve on its predecessor in any significant regard. Even the aforementioned highlights don't quite shine like their counterparts from last time around: Nothing on the new album swoops quite like ""Velvet Girl"", or soars quite like ""Setting Sun"" (""Chaos"" does come close), or snarls quite like ""Low Happening"". That's okay; Wars also shouldn't put off anyone who loved the first record, and thanks to increased worldwide exposure this time around, it will likely catch the attention of new fans looking to expand their scope of listening outside the present day alt-rock mainstream, but not too far. Sometimes wars are won with persistence and numbers alone, after all. And in any case, when you're cruising along in a pleasure craft as nice and reliable as this one, it's all right to tread a little water.","Just off a high-profile tour with Coldplay and Snow Patrol, this London-via-Sydney band releases its second album and first in three years.

The Best B Sides Ever,The Boy Least Likely To,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a582ea9e61561daa5160/1:1/w_160/2b27dcf9.jpg,2009-07-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13332-the-best-b-sides-ever/,+1,"""Our last album was meant to be our 'angry' album,"" the Boy Least Likely To announced in a recent tweet. For guys who introduced themselves to the world by asking us to be gentle with them, ""angry"" is a relative term. The story of the UK indie pop duo's wonderfully ramshackle 2005 debut, The Best Party Ever, is something like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah without the New York media glare or square-baiting obliqueness: from homemade 7""s to Oscar-night soda commercials, all in a few short years. 2009's The Law of the Playground adds depth, if little breadth, to their near-perfectly realized birthday-party aesthetic, while among the professionally hip, admitting your own insecurities remains as frowned upon as ever. When your entire band concept is based around identifying with the sensitive but neurotic outcasts, your B-sides better damn well bring your A-game. The Best B Sides Ever doesn't disappoint. Originally bundled with Rough Trade Shop pre-orders for The Law of the Playground, and now available only at independent record stores, this slight but almost wholly satisfying disc is well worth any TBLLT fan's recession-pinched dollar. With two revealing covers and originals that at times rival their A-sides, singer/vocalist Jof Owen and multi-instrumentalist/composer Pete Hobbs keep their hearts precariously on their sleeve and their production colorfully ramshackle. Yup: acoustic guitar, banjo, synths, recorder, xylophone, stuffed-animals-on-parade drums, and whispery singing. Dudes who hate this shit and anything else that smacks of wimpiness, you can buy two and say it's for your sister. Deep down, you're one of us, too. The covers aren't far from TBLLT's usual territory, but they're expertly enfolded in the group's deceptively childlike universe. Where Limp Bizkit made George Michael's ""Faith"" safe for the moshers, this version emphasizes the song's simple emotions and gold-plated pop craft. There's jauntiness to spare, sure, but little trace of irony. If this ""Faith"" turns chart-pop into twee-pop, then the disc's spare, faithful cover of the Field Mice's ""Between Hello and Goodbye"" could just as easily introduce Sarah Records to the charts. You don't need a tattered collection of 1980s NMEs to enjoy simple guitar, heartfelt vocals, twinkling percussion, and a beautifully aching romantic ballad, just ambiguous enough to reward listen after listen. (You do need the Field Mice, though, for your personal enjoyment.) Elsewhere, the originals shed new light on an established persona, with results that range from the exceptional to the ""mediocre for the Boy Least Likely To"". With a bottom made out of rubber, a top-end made out of snips and snails and puppy-dog tails, ""Oddballs"" falls closer to the latter category, suggesting a name for the CD artwork's fine fuzzy wuzzies but breaking little new ground. Closer ""Cuddle Me"", meanwhile, at first seems like an almost too-literal encapsulation of the group's softer side. Within those watery sound effects and faraway rum-pum-pums, however, is an overwhelming vulnerability that should still be a treat for core indie-pop fans. ""I hurt the things I love/ Because it stops them hurting me,"" Owen sings. If you can relate, you can spend a rainy afternoon daydreaming to this. The Best B-Sides Ever is best when it's tinged with nostalgia. It's a kind of nostalgia that works both ways: Lost childhood becomes a metaphor for lost love on midtempo banjo-synth reminiscence ""Every Grubby Little Memory"", but ""When I Grow Up I Want to Be a Boy Again"" hopes to find the past in the future. While the guitar underneath the latter song's outer-space synth burbles comes perilously close to Sixpence None the Richer's ""Kiss Me"", the vivid imagery of felt-tip pens and first-snow excitement easily wins out.

Person to Person,Foreign Born,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4915e6ef959693208d7/1:1/w_160/859f7e71.jpg,2009-07-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13123-person-to-person/,Secretly Canadian,"Depending on where you lay your head most nights, the term ""summer jam"" can trigger a wide variety of feelings and sounds. Birthday sex? The best you ever had? Sure, but that's a different kind of summer heat altogether. What if you live in a place where, save for some nasty winds every now and again, summer seems like the season and state-of-mind all year round? There are never any icy sidewalks to brave, fewer windshields to scrape, and bands aren't throwing 'bows for cramped rehearsal spaces-- just miles of hot beach, palm trees, and outdoor dining all day every day. Foreign Born are an L.A. indie rock outfit that exist further west and outside of the Smell or Silver Lake, a band that seems to have germinated over the years outside all semblances of scene in a city whose guitar music rarely sounds genuinely Californian. I'm writing from the opposite coast, but Foreign Born have made a record that feels like a conversation with the Pacific coastline and sounds like endless summer. That's harder to do well than one might think. Before assembling Person to Person, their second full-length and first for Secretly Canadian, Foreign Born were a band whose rootless pop rocks were still in search of a way to do its geography proud. They branched out, taking layers of vaguely African percussive styles and made them bedrock for frothy, weightless guitar rock. No matter how muscular or tethered to the ground, each four-minute burst sounds as though it could float up and away. Take opener ""Blood Oranges"" and the way it traipses out a series of firefly guitar figures before the roto toms kick and the song guns it into sun showers. It's a shift from light to shadow, tiny to epic, and it bolsters these songs even when the drums aren't banging. ""That Old Sun"" and ""Winter Games"" are sweaty BBQ squealers (The Band! The Allman Brothers!) minus the spillage, frontbrah Matt Popieluch's bronzy vocals a fine match for a mix that always feel controlled, no matter how free or insanely vivid. What's more, Popieluch earns his nonprofit daycheck working in L.A. parks, a job that's sure to build a lyricbook rife with images bright enough to make a dude shield his eyes. Next to the textural anthemics of ""Vacationing People"", the highlife guitar runs of ""Early Warnings"" anchor a first half every bit as airtight as its comedown second. Closer ""Wait in This Chair"" is easy living, and the final 85 seconds of ""See Us Home"" is the best Coldplay send-off since TV on the Radio snaked a page out of that band's gameplan just last year: gorgeous, wave-of-the-hand melodicism that takes your feet from you better than riptides. So soon after Vampire Weekend in particular has been able to convince kids to steal their parents' copies of *Graceland,Â Foreign Born's use of African music here don't smack of trendhopping or wonky appropriation. Guitarist Lewis Pesacov and drummer Garrett Ray have been studying and nerding out with these sounds in L.A. clubs for years, equally seamless fruits of which can also be heard in their work with Afro-Hebrew collective Fool's Gold. You can tell that these songs were shaped and sculpted and polished ten times over, the attention to detail and space a welcome step away from the often sloppy clumps of no-fi ruckus clattering up from garages and out of bedrooms everywhere right about now. That music makes sense during a claustrophobic January, but why bother. *Person to Person should prove just as satisfying to watch blossom by the time we're there again.","Another in a line of 2009 beachcombers, L.A.'s Foreign Born offer an LP that feels like a conversation with the Pacific Coast and sounds like endless summer.

Sacred Psalms,Our Brother the Native,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a500ea9e61561daa502c/1:1/w_160/2ecff891.jpg,2009-07-22 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13221-sacred-psalms/,Fat Cat,"A few months back, Bradford Cox's blog featured a YouTube clip in which a teenager recorded himself covering Bon Iver, Beach House, Panda Bear, and (of course) Deerhunter, along with some original material. Regardless of the quality of the renditions, what struck me was the illustration of instantaneous influence in 2009 captured in real time-- once even the bigger underground names would have had to fester in obscurity for a while before their presence was felt in a larger context. But as it becomes increasingly easy to record as well as distribute music, it's become increasingly likely that bands that are forming right this second could be heard from six months or a year from now, not only before they've taken the time to establish their own identity, but while their most obvious precedents might still be riding out their last record release cycle. Take, for example, Our Brother the Native, still teens when signed to the esteemed FatCat imprint. Even if that's like getting an Ivy acceptance letter, they took massive student loans from contemporaries like the Books and especially Animal Collective up-to-and-including-Sung Tongs. Tooth & Claw, their proper debut, was released in 2006, the very, very tail-end of ""freak-folk as an ongoing concern with the indie kids."" It was promising and flawed and in love with its source material, as to be expected, but at least they were on the right track-- it's sort of disingenuous to reward youth qua youth, but likewise, it's tough to pass judgment if you were covering Sponge songs in your garage at the same age (um, not that I'd know). But with Sacred Psalms, it's hard to shake the idea that maybe that they could've used some time woodshedding with proper songs*.* These guys love their brassy, ringing textures-- chimes, gamelan, thumb pianos, and the like subsumed by a hazy production veil of buzz and reverb. Problem is, they like them all at the same time, and parsing the clamorous ""Well Bred"" is like trying to pick out individual flavors in a Long Island Iced Tea; get to ""Dusk"" and it's like trying to do the same after five. The album's first half tries to conjure an Elverum-styled sense of naturalist dread with doomy, didgeridoo-like drones, wandering acoustics, and scratchy vocal snippets, and it eventually wafts out of those murky eddies into a nearly dancehall-derived drumbeat. Which is admittedly a neat direction, but the only reason I can't use the term ""momentum-killing"" in regards to its forbidding seven-minute runtime is that there isn't much momentum to kill, by design. Like drum circles or pre-shot-clock NBA games, it's easy to see how lack of structure is freeing to its participants and repellent to its observers. In Mark Richardson's review of Tooth & Claw, he offered the hope that Our Brother's iffy singing could be fixed with time (or at least a vocal coach), but you have to wonder if they're so enamored with a type of sylvan authenticity that troubleshooting never crossed their minds. This style of music doesn't require a conventional-sounding voice or even a really good one. But while ""Well Bred"" and ""Manes"" have hooks that feel more substantial and stand-alone than any from their debut, even if their appearance gives one the feeling of brief moments of clarity after being roused from a particularly intense siesta. But they're still employed in the same-defeating way, delivered by unpleasantly overwrought Beirut (the band)-via-Baltimore (the scene, ca. 2007) vocals that evoke any number of post-Fugazi emoists rather than catharsis or celebration. Closer ""Endless Winter"" doesn't totally redeem the 40 minute-investment in Sacred Psalms' nougat-y center, but it does sort of serve as a potential corrective-- it bears plenty in common with what preceded, what with its maundering tempo and multimedia samples (though their pan-Arabic sound brings to mind too much mawkish sound collage from 2002). But a disarmingly straightforward piano melody stumbles nakedly in and out, by a large margin the most memorable and simple passage on a record that's too strained in voice and in reverence to bands that paved the way with years of bold and blind experimentation before they ended up sounding like themselves (and really, that's the unifying quality of 2009's Indie Big Three). The Deer Tick of freak-folk? Discuss...","Three years after its debut, and a year after its second album and EP, the young and wooly noise-folk outfit returns.

Lessons in the Woods or a City,Talbot Tagora,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4dd9d034d5c69bf3179/1:1/w_160/32d19e99.jpg,2009-07-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13172-lessons-in-the-woods-or-a-city/,Hardly Art,"Seattle art-punk trio Talbot Tagora clearly understand the importance of a moniker. Naming themselves for a defunct European car that valued practicality over style yet was not practical enough (i.e., gas-efficient) to withstand the late-1970s energy crisis, the band announces its interest in the mechanical, the proletariat, and the cruelly ironic. And the title of the self-released CD-R/tape veterans' proper debut for Hardly Art, Lessons in the Woods or a City, hints at the mysterious, primal menace and noisy, urban clamor contained within. Talbot Tagora are disciples of No Age's muddy, muddled punk, but take their psych-drenched sounds out of sunny, smoggy Los Angeles and into the Pacific Northwest, where the metallic clang of big-city life rings out through thick cloud cover and lush, sound-absorbent forests. The glue, then, of their first widely available collection is an echoey sludge that envelops every track, making it sound like the band is bashing away at their instruments from the bottom of a well or conducting a particularly raucous practice underwater. Songs bleed into one another, as the wiry, high-pitched guitars and flatly thudding drums pervade every track and fade out into blustery dissonance at the end of each song, and lyrics are mostly indistinguishable thanks to their nasal, blunted delivery and the highly distorted microphones the band uses. Only occasionally do you hear a smattering of verbiage-- ""Park your vehicle under Tiger Mountain with the swastikas and the glass all over,"" ""We can choose to go to hell if we want to. Yes, he like's this. He's a masochist,"" ""Break me out of jail""-- that only adds to the sense of sinister aggression that prevails throughout. Talbot Tagora create a dense thicket of tinny guitar riffs (which are too repetitive to be abstract, yet too unstructured or amelodic to be pop), dirty basslines, and jittery, thumping percussion that all-too-often races ahead of the beat so that the other instruments sound like they are breathlessly trying to catch up. There is, therefore, a sameness that saturates the album; no track deviates from the unwavering intensity. And thus, the record is better digested in its entirety, rather than song-by-song. The uniformity isn't a bad thing, though, and there some tracks that stand out from the rest. ""Johnny Lazor"" gallops along on propulsive, shuffling drums and a distorted walking guitar line that is mimicked in the taunted vocal melody. ""Mouth Rainboy"" is built on ticky-tacky stickwork and churning, churlish guitars, and is one of the few songs that listeners can sing along with since its few lyrics are almost audible and chanted repeatedly. And ""Perception Stick"", with its simplified (and relatively slow) 60s rock beat and dry, monotone boy/girl singing, feels like an homage to Sonic Youth circa Daydream Nation. The band has a timeless punk set-up of just guitar, bass, and drums, but there is something futuristic about their sound, as the heavy reverb lends a silvery patina to everything from the stabbing guitar lines to the opaque co-ed vocals. And with songs that are raw and antagonistic, yet dreamy and droning, Talbot Tagora fulfill the destiny of their namesake: There is no pretense in their simple arrangements, but you can hear their motor revving, and you know they'll never run out of gas.","Seattle art-punk trio, true to its own, locates interesting turns inÂ the mechanical, the proletariat, and the cruelly ironic.

Georgiavania,Willie Isz,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53c5e6ef95969320a64/1:1/w_160/fce3aa59.jpg,2009-07-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13275-georgiavania/,Lex,"Khujo Goodie's voice does not fuck around. It's one of the rawest flows to ever go abstract, but in the pieces of grit and gravel that line it you can still hear the meanings clearly. When that voice warns of an upcoming American Holocaust or accuses labels of perpetrating modern-day slavery, you believe it; when it delivers stories of unfair prison bids and deteriorating cities, you feel it. If any member of the Dungeon Family deserves the kind of commercial-slash-artistic breakthrough that made ""Hey Ya"" and ""Crazy"" inescapable, it's him, though getting Khujo to compromise himself to get it is out of the question. He'd need to roll with someone willing to take chances. Enter Jneiro Jarel, the mind behind borderline-psychedelic underground hip-hop projects like Dr. Who Dat and Shape of Broad Minds-- a man who's been compared to Madlib and Flying Lotus, and a dedicated fan of Khujo's style who previously recruited him for a remix of SoBM single ""OPR8R"". That collaboration succeeded to the point where they decided to create their own surrealist supergroup, situate it in a fictional portmanteau of the two states the artists come from, and experiment with a few forays into underexplored turf. That makes Georgiavania defiant by design, one of those albums where a couple of creative renegades flip out over every stylistic possibility available to them, overextend their ambition, and still come away from it making its missteps sound exciting. Not that there's a ton of missteps on this album, though-- more like some moments where you kind of wonder what they were thinking, give them marks for effort, and then find some strange appeal in it after the fact. ""The Grussle"" is one of those tracks that immediately slaps you upside the head with how audacious it is-- an Irish country-style fiddle melody combined with a slow-ride Southern bounce groove-- but once the novelty wears off it's easier to focus on its rhythmic slinkiness and how comfortable Khujo sounds in its odd environment. And there's a three-song stretch early in the album-- the gothic new wave ""Loner"", the Tunde Adebimpe-assisted electro-punk ""Gawn Jet"", and the shoegaze doo-wop of ""I Didn't Mean To""-- where Jarel and Khujo go overboard in pushing hip-hop into places most people aren't ready for it to be taken; that they take it somewhere rewardingly unique is worth the risk. Besides, there's still a bit of familiarity in the songs that touch on Southern-style hip-hop skewed just a little strange, and when that happens, it's an advancement in its own right. Khujo retains much of the same grimy consciousness that he mastered in his Goodie Mob days, championing his work ethic on ""The Grussle"" and snatching your breath with his empathy-stoking class-war struggles on the album-closing ""In the Red"" (""We know talk is cheap and closed mouths don't get fed/ But we starvin' down here, can you spare some bread?""). That Jarel can hang with Khujo on the mic is a pleasant surprise, at least for those who slept on him as just another producer. His Soulja Boy-needling performance on the title track and his doomsaying get-right warnings on ""Prepare Fo It (Spiritual Gladiators)"" follow some of Khujo's most liquid Mach 1 flows on the album, and he holds his own with a subtly Big Boi-ish smoothness that just barely hides some heavy-minded undertones. With all this envelope-pushing, there'll inevitably be some excursions that don't entirely work. The woozy avant-soul ""Violet Heart Box"" sounds like an analog synth tribute to seasickness, and the spaced-out electrofunk of ""Autopilot"" feels a little weightless in those moments where Khujo's voice isn't there to give the rhythm more backbone. But they're more weird-confusing than weird-bad, and by the time they show up near the end of what's already been a startlingly original album, it's easy to accept failing at the unusual over succeeding at the ordinary. Hip-hop needs more albums willing to be this strange, and hopefully this is the one that gives these two artists some new, hard-earned shine.","MC Khujo Goodie of Goodie Mob and producer Jneiro Jarel team up on a startlingly original album that's unafraid to be strange but still bumps.

Mutually Arising,Greg Davis,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a536c0084474cd0c0683/1:1/w_160/31413b4c.jpg,2009-07-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13269-mutually-arising/,Kranky,"Permit an old college yarn: One night sophomore year, as several of us pecked away at Playstation controllers, a perpetually stoned friend sipped an off-brand 40 oz. As he tipped the bottle, he intermittently updated his thoughts on the taste: ""tart,"" then ""sweet"", then (drunker) ""peanuts"", then, finally, ""ice cream."" Though perhaps not quite the psychedelic experience that is cheap malt liquor, ""Cosmic Mudra"", the first of two long-form drones on Greg Davis' Mutually Arising, functions much the same way: A single, homogeneous substance pours out of your speakers, its effects dependent on how long you've been listening. Tedious at first but, as it progresses, overtones accumulate and bass frequencies begin to shiver, spraying gnarled tones across your living room. It is room-altering, melodic even, however abstractly. If that sounds like a heap of rockcrit mumbo-jumbo, forgive me: Mutually Arising-- one 29-minute drone and one 22-minute drone-- is unbending and blocky even in the context of experimental composition. Its dearth of complementary sounds and slight instrumentation (its credits, in whole, read: ""Korg mono/poly & crumar stratus analog synthesizers, various effects pedals & computer"") aside, Mutually Arising is a maximal album, totally saturated, and your enjoyment of it may change depending on how much air your stereo/living environment permits you to shove around. At low volumes, Mutually Arising is sleepy and unassuming; high volumes can help unlock the scant few sounds and textures Davis allows to leak. ""Cosmic Mudra"" is the stronger track; it soaks and wiggles, and, if you can maintain attention through its runtime, it will offer some subtle, erudite rewards. ""Hall of Pure Bliss"", its name giggling-ly ironic given that it's not the best track on a two-track album, pans a flat, nasally drone between channels as a slowly pulsing tone sits quietly between them. Two-thirds of the way through, the panning tones drop out and a quiet, somnambulant smudge leads you along as the noise fades to nothing. The track is basically a 22-minute journey from almost nothing to completely nothing, which, as an exercise in restraint for a formally educated musician, might have some value, but it's hardly the most compelling work Davis has turned in. Sitting in a room and composing half-hour, unflinching drone epics is never a ""normal"" activity. But from an artist who once covered an Incredible String Band song, for one whose collaborations with SÃ©bastien Roux, Jeph Jerman, and Keith Fullerton Whitman have yielded bold, strange fruits, Mutually Arising feels a bit too settled in its own monolithic devices, as if this is the kind of music Davis is supposed to make. Davis has frequently offered more, though, and the brief, off-balance moments of clarity ""Cosmic Mudra"" offers suggest he will in the future as well.","Versatile producer here turns his attention to static long-form drone, crafting two pieces of more than 20 minutes each.

I'm Going Away,The Fiery Furnaces,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ffb1335d7bf1698ac6/1:1/w_160/25698679.jpg,2009-07-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13220-im-going-away/,Thrill Jockey,"The Fiery Furnaces have a well-deserved reputation for being difficult and willfully perverse both in concert and on record, so it may be easy to forget that the band started off fairly simple. Gallowsbird's Bark, their first and (to my mind, finest) album, is a free-wheeling blues-rock romp ideally suited to drunken sing-alongs in rowdy bars, albeit the old-timey kind that primarily exist in the fanciful imaginations of Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger. This sort of low-key, lowbrow tunefulness has always been a central component of theÂ Friedbergers'Â aesthetic, even when they're off on proggy rock opera tangents, splicing their live shows into deliberately jarring sound collages, or roping their grandmother in to sing her own surreal, heavily fictionalized biography. After a half decade of booby-trapping many of their most charming melodies, the Furnaces have come full circle with I'm Going Away, a set of clean, straightforward tunes that, like those on Gallowbird's, would sound terrific playing on a pub jukebox. Cultish fans may find themselves disappointed by how well-behaved the band sounds on I'm Going Away, but anyone who has been paying attention each step of the way would note this is not a sudden departure or artistic retreat-- it's part of a steady progression. Matthew Friedberger may have jettisoned his impulse to overstuff his compositions with unnecessary leads, but his melodic sensibility remains intact and boldened by streamlined arrangements emphasizing acoustic piano and the crisp, groovy percussion of drummer Robert D'Amico. The difference in this album isn't simply a matter of scaling back and dialing down eccentricities, but in the way the quartet embraces their rhythmic strengths, and subtly integrate elements from old school R&B in tracks like ""The End Is Near"", ""Drive to Dallas"", and ""Keep Me in Dark"" without resorting to pastiche or going against the grain of their established style. Compared to the weirder tracks on Widow City or Bitter Tea, these songs may sound relatively ""normal,"" but there's no confusing this music with anyone else-- the tunes follow familiar Friedbergian patterns, and Eleanor's vocal cadences are as distinct and unmistakable as anyone in contemporary pop this side of Snoop Dogg and Lil' Wayne. As on Gallowsbird's Bark, Eleanor Friedberger is the primary author of the lyrics on I'm Going Away, and the contrast with her brother's words on their four previous efforts is immediately noticeable. Though both siblings have a taste for packing their verses with tongue-twisters and obscure references, Eleanor's lyrics are far more emotionally direct, revealing, and confrontational. Whereas Matthew's songs lean heavily on skewed fictional narratives that are brilliantly crafted yet emotionally unengaging, the lyrics here are mostly autobiographical first-person accounts of romantic dissolution. Eleanor's words cut deep, but only to a point-- there is sorrow and regret, for sure, but there is also a slight aloofness, implying a character willing to speak her mind but not quite let her guard down. In some cases, this comes off like a Dylan-esque pose, particularly on the Highway 61 Revisited-ish ""Cut the Cake"", but for the most part, the reserved approach to personal revelation is entirely appropriate. This isn't ""confessional"" music, at least not in the way that we often understand that mode of songwriting to be about venting pain and anxiety. This is more about reflection on the past, or even a reconfiguration of memory to make sense of the present tense. This is certainly the case for ""Lost at Sea"", a gorgeous ballad near the end of the sequence that finds Eleanor struggling to understand her reasons for ending a relationship. It's easily one of the Friedbergers' best compositions to date, but also one of the most atypical, as its majestic piano parts recall Elton John's work in the early 70s, and Eleanor's lyrics have an unadorned candor generally lacking in their older work. After six years of songs about everything from cell phone salesmen in the Middle East to being kidnapped by sinister Mormons, there is something refreshing in hearing her sing something as relatable and unpretentious as ""Baby I'm... maybe I'm not me."" Not every song is so nakedly emotional. A solid third of I'm Going Away sticks to the band's thematic comfort zone, i.e., romanticizing seemingly lost cultural moments from the not-too-distant past. The record starts with the title track, a traditional number arranged by the duo to sound convincingly like one of their originals, and it bows out with ""Take Me Round Again"", a rollicking chorus in rounds that name checks popular songs from the early 20th century, including ""When a Fellow's on the Level With a Girl That's on the Square"", ""The Merry Widow Waltz"", and ""See Saw Margery Daw"". Like most of the duo's body of work, the latter practically demands annotation, and it certainly gains something from a bit of research. Ultimately, it's unnecessary-- the pleasures of ""Take Me Round Again"", like the rest of I'm Going Away, are immediate and unforced. The Fiery Furnaces will always be arty and precious, but they definitely know their way around a good tune. Have a drink and sing along.","The often inscrutableÂ Friedberger siblings make a welcome comeback on this, their most accessible record in years.

To Win or to Lose,The Pine Hill Haints,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e75e6ef95969320999/1:1/w_160/dad7ef84.jpg,2009-07-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13200-to-win-or-to-lose/,K,"Lots of genre names get thrown around to describe the Pine Hill Haints: rockabilly, punk, Celtic, blues. It helps, because regular rock'n'roll adjectives-- gritty, spirited, haunted-- describe their presence but fail to provide a sense of their unique throwback hop. So let's be clear: Normally when a reviewer says a band ""does not let any genre define them,"" they mean simply that no single genre properly describes the band. When I say it with regard to the Pine Hill Haints, and their new record To Win or to Lose, it means that the Haints have managed to weld a recognizable style from these genres with the style and precision of a band with a much larger profile. To Win or to Lose, the band's second album on K Records, marks their boldest effort yet, mostly abandoning the playful, deflective subject matter of previous albums for bold, scattered character-making. The shift, however subtle, is successful because the Haints maintain not only their brittle, rock grooves but also their sense of humor, companionship, and identity, such that no one ever mulls whether the Alabama quintet has ""matured"" or some such other nonsense. The beautifully recorded To Win or to Lose (engineered by Lynn Bridges) greets each of the Haints' many instruments-- accordions washboard, saw, bucket-- with ample space and warmth. On previous albums the band has relied on lead Haint Jamie Barrier's spindly electric riffing to carry their rhythms, but here Barrier limits himself mostly to small percussive slashes (an exception: listen to his guitar twirl gracefully in the fires of ""Not So Lucky and the Invisible Kid""), freeing your attention for the mulling bass tones, painted drum work, and, most prominently, accordion. Overselling the originality would be a mistake. At any given moment you will recognize the DNA of a Haints song, and, were you to have a broad definition of ""folk"" or even maybe ""Appalachian"" music, you could slap a word on it, but the arrangements are clever and eerie. My cat jumped at the hot-plate bass that carries the minimal, clacking ""Revenge of the Spider-Web Boy"". Note the trebly, tropical mandolin of ""Bordello Blackwidow""; shiver and strut with the spectral guitars of ""Screaming Jenny"". To Win or to Lose brims with these ear-pricks, which spice the Haints' traditional minute-long spitfires and buy them time for their mostly new exploration of longer compositions like ""Never Cry"" and ""Doublehead"". The songs are propped up by the scarred vocals of Barrier, but his voice isn't Waits-ian or ""damaged""; he's merely adept at coughing out phrases in suggestive and unexpected ways. He seems increasingly interested in characters, and he can be blockily poetic. During ""Never Cry"", he speaks of a roving band of ""fair-weather friends"" who stick around only when it's warm out. On ""My Bones Are Gonna Rise Again"", another vocalist, Matt Bakula, notes, ""Her lips were frosty as a root-beer mug."" The bratty sing-song hooks of ""My Bones"" or ""Never Cry"" provide the type of in-your-ear footholds that the Haints albums have lacked in the past. To callback the album title's sentiment: to win, mostly. The Haints have always nipped at their own sound. On To Win or to Lose they find it, each of their deftly carved instruments aimed like pistols at your heels. As a bonus, Barrier's ghoulish dark-world now offers more depth than 1950s love dramas and ghost tales. To Win or to Lose contains roaming gangs, thieves, and kids both invisible and spider-webbed. It's like Tim Burton: South. Shuffle in.","Rootsy Alabama band with a punk streak returns with another strong album packed with varied instrumentation and evocative imagery.

Dabke 2020: Folk and Pop Sounds of Syria,Omar Souleyman,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a483c0084474cd0c04e4/1:1/w_160/b03adea4.jpg,2009-07-21 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13114-dabke-2020-folk-and-pop-sounds-of-syria/,Sublime Frequencies,"Most of what we hear about Syria dribbles to us in news reports, and most of those reports are really about Israel, Lebanon, or Iraq. As a result, Americans grow up with a distorted view of Syria, seeing it as a satellite orbiting the Axis of Evil and a regional bully with little regard for, say, the lives of ordinary Lebanese people. And at least as far as its government is concerned, there's some truth to that image. Bashar Al-Assad wouldn't exactly be cover material for Democracy & Human Rights Magazine, if such a publication existed, but behind him and his cohort there's a whole Syria we never get to see, a place of abundant entrepreneurial spirit and immense cultural heritage spanning millennia-- Syria is the railing on the cradle of civilization. In the country's agricultural Northeast lies the city of Hassake (also transliterated Al-Hasakah and several other ways). It's a sizable town, but it's also a bit out of the way, straddling a tributary of the Euphrates that spends part of the year as a muddy wadi and hugging the inner curve of the Fertile Crescent. The population is a mix of Kurds, Assyrians, and Syrian Arabs, and it's no surprise the area produced a potent musical amalgam. That's what the music of Omar Souleyman is-- a modernized blend of old musics that collideÂ in the modern Middle East. He draws from Kurdish and Turkic music, Iraqi choubi, and the dabke, a broad regional Arab folk style that grew out of a celebratory line dance developed by Levantine builders seeking an efficient way to stamp down the materials used to make a wattle-and-daub roof. The future-past implications of the title Dabke 2020 could hardly be more perfect for describing Souleyman's wild, buzzing Arab New Wave. This disc compiles music recorded between 1998 and 2008 and released on cassette in Syria, and builds on Sublime Frequencies' first Souleyman compilation, 2007's Highway to Hassake, which was reissued on vinyl this year. It opens with its least party-worthy track, ""Atabat"", named for its style of sung poetry. Souleyman cries out in the melismatic Arabic mawaal style and is answered alternately by soulful saz solos and a blistering, progged-out synthesizer. The synthesizer's nasal tone takes center stage on the next track, blazing over the machine-gun drum programming-- for a lot of Western listeners, that wall of sharp-toned, constantly fluttering synth will be a little too much to take. If you're not already used to Arabic pop music, Souleyman is bound to be something of an acquired taste. That said, there are a couple of tracks that don't require much acclimatization, including the two that close the record. ""Laqtuf Ward Min Khaddak (I Will Pick a Flower From Your Cheek)"" has a rhythm track like a hyperspeed Middle Eastern ""Knight Rider"" theme, and the dust storm swirl of synthesizer uses a mellower tone that's a sympathetic companion for Souleyman's husky baritone. Closer ""Kaset Hanzal (Drinking From the Glass of Bitterness)"" nearly brings things full circle to ""Atabat"" with its slow organic percussion and mixture of roughly scraped violin and synthesizer. Western listeners with a keen sense of audio adventure should have no problem feeling the groove of Souleyman's future folk and should take Dabke 2020 as what it is: a chance to know the music of a people politics has long kept at arm's length.","Drawing from Kurdish and Turkic music, Iraqi choubi, and the dabke, Souleyman makesÂ a modernized blend of old musics that collide in the modern Middle East.

Rites,Lights,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57513d1975652138f6a/1:1/w_160/0115d3f2.jpg,2009-07-21 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13321-rites/,Drag City,"Rites is just about as good a stoner rock album as I've heard in as long as I can remember. It's also one of the better radio-ready pop records of the last several months, and occasionally a more than adequate (if swivel-troublingly ethereal) dancefloor filler. That's some gap between Acid King and Kelly Clarkson, you know, a challenge the shapeshifting Brooklyn collective Lights meet at nearly every turn; pure, pretty pop rubs elbows with fistpump fodder in the same song, occasionally intermingling but never interfering. That kind of swift and changeable movement between genre means just about every sound they touch on, they can handle. And it's some list. Take if you will ""Heavy Drops"", a sprawling, Dean Wareham-jamming-with-Pink-Floyd slow-burner with a supple, slightly sour, country-tinged melody. Or ""Can You Hear Me?"", equal parts Bobby Womack, the Spice Girls, ""Stillness Is the Move"", Rumours, and ""Baker Street"". Shades of the Everly Brothers and Lucinda Williams' better ballads color the multipart ""Love""; well, the parts that aren't in waltz time, anyhow. ""Hold On"" imagines PJ Harvey as Neil Young, while ""Fire Night"" takes DFA style disco funk to Paris for the evening. I could go on, but unlike music writing that delights in reference dropping for its own sake, Rites' fluidity of motion keeps things from getting awkward and self-congratulatory. That ""Fire Night"" crackles out just seconds before ""We Belong"" trickles in seems the most natural thing in the world. Guitarist Sophia Knapp and drummer Linnea Vedder, who share lead vocal duties, are blessed with pipes so well matched you might wonder if they're related. Though equally strong on their own, moments where both share the mic seem stolen, each voice coiling around the other before heading skyward. They're great screamers, too, as the louder moments prove; nowhere is this clearer than on ""War Theme"", where nonsense words meet some very serious, fuzzed up rock'n'roll. As riff-rockers, the taut, bottom-heavy Lights would inspire lighters; as balladeers, they're ready for your swoons now. The compositions are assured, but never overly busy; just as it takes some serious work to map out a builder like ""Love"" or ""Can You Hear Me?"", it takes some pretty solid musicians to stay out of the way of a melody as bloody gorgeous as the one at the heart of ""Nothing Left to Build"". And while not all the ideas are good ones-- the waltz around ""Love"" is awkward and the Fleetwood Mac cover that closes out the record is pointless-- there's certainly no shortage. What's most interesting about Rites is what happens when a little snippet of one idea seems to land atop something else altogether. Take ""Love"", which has all the spindly melody of an Aimee Mann tune, but eventually breaks into an ""ooh-hoo, yeah"" you could build a Jessica Simpson song around. Or ""Hold On"", which starts out screaming and winds up cooing like Emmylou Harris singing with Hawkwind. Good as Lights seem to be moving between one idea and the next, they're at their best when they're stuck between the two, and I only wish there were a little bit more making nice between the bits that rumble and the ones that unfurl a little more slowly. It's this that makes Rites just a little more boring than it oughta be; there's not a lot of middle ground between the thumpers and the swayers, and while the ballads are well-hewn and plenty lovely, when interspersed with the rockers, they do mess with momentum a bit. A fondness for either Sleep or the Spinanes won't necessarily make Rites for you; not many doom metal records take the occasional cue from Bachelor #2, and unless you've got strong feelings for both, enjoying Rites means making room for either. That's what's so great about it, though; save the Vaseline-on-lens Fleetwood Mac number that closes things out, there's nary a dull patch or an awkward spot to be found here, just a sublime (if sorta schizoid) trip through the warmest, spaciest parts of your record collection.","Drag City debut is a wonderful stoner rock record, but so much more, finding inspiration in everything from soul and country to radio pop and classic rock.

The Knot,Wye Oak,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4feea9e61561daa5026/1:1/w_160/a08889bd.jpg,2009-07-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13219-the-knot/,Merge,"Wye Oak's debut, If Children, was a small, surprising record. Surprising because it was the sound of two kids, barely 21, playing earnest, noisy folk-rock that ignored nearly every trend in indie music; surprising because it came out of Baltimore, a city whose indie scene-- lead by Dan Deacon and bands like Ponytail-- is publicized for its spasm and flash. Surprising because of the sympathy in Jenn Wasner's lyrics. Most of the songs on the album were about age and domesticity, and most of the time it was impossible to gauge how old or domestic the band was. The character of Wasner's voice flickered between baby bunny and bitter wife, and swelling, muscular moments in the music were as confidently handled as the quiet ones. If it's not obvious that I sincerely love the band Wye Oak (and not for sentimental reasons), let me clarify that I do-- and so it's with bit lip and heavy heart that I report on The Knot. The record doesn't feel as varied or agile as If Children did-- which is too bad only because If Children proved they could make a varied, agile record. Songs rarely pick up from a crawl. Sustained guitar chords fan out and crush whatever momentum the band gets going. The bursts of distortion that colored If Children are almost pornographically expanded. It's also about as close to objectively gorgeous music as I can imagine. Drummer Andy Stack's arrangements are integral and imaginative: The big string-section harmonies on ""I Want For Nothing"" practically pry the song open; the unrepentantly rock climax of ""For Prayer"" washes away on the mercurial sound of slide guitars. But dirges like ""Mary Is Mary"" and ""Slight, Flight"" end up serving as measuring sticks for how much pretty is too much pretty-- for me, it's about five minutes. If not five, definitely seven and a half. Wasner's voice has become more expressive, something I'd noticed during live performances of songs from If Children. There's probably more than one good way to sing the lines, ""Do you never ask because you know I'll say/ You're the only one?""-- ""but you're not the only one,"" but damn if they don't feel like anvils when she drops them. I mention all their achievements because I feel like Wye Oak is still a young band, still growing, still singular. When I met Jenn and Andy last April, we talked briefly about the reviews for If Children-- one of which I wrote for this site. Jenn said that the numbers didn't matter to them at the moment, and surprisingly, it looked like she meant it. ""The way I see it,"" she said, ""we're going to be doing this for a long time."" Here's hoping.","After its surprising, quietly effective debut,Â If Children, Merge band returns with a new set of gorgeous songs.

Josephine,Magnolia Electric Co.,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4fd9d034d5c69bf31c3/1:1/w_160/33c13684.jpg,2009-07-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13218-josephine/,Secretly Canadian,"Jason Molina used to wail. In a review of the Songs: Ohia album that gave Molina's Magnolia Electric Co. it's name, Eric Carr chastised a guest singer with, ""[H]e's not Molina, whose voice you paid to hear."" Another Forker, William Bowers, once referred to Molina's voice as an ""occasionally erect vibrato."" Like chalking a pool cue, Molina's distinctive bleat was a hedge against flaws, and even his best, most interesting albums feature many. You know where this is going. That final Songs: Ohia marked not just a stylistic shift for Molina, from doom-folker to classic rocker, but a vocal one as well: The man fell in love with his croon, an even, spread-able tenor, and one that has smoothed the edges of Molina's full-band works with Magnolia Electric Co. Billed as a comparatively sparse counterpoint to Magnolia's recent classic-rock material, Josephine offered real stimulus for change: a three-year studio-album hiatus, the longest of his career; a move to London for a famous Midwesterner; one more turn with frequent engineer Steve Albini; the December 2007 passing of touring bassist Evan Farrell. But no. Look no further than ""Whip-poor-will"", which, if you're keeping score at home (Molina's fondness for baseball and for numbers suggests he hopes you are), was the finest of a fine set of outtakes for the aforementioned Magnolia Electric Co. album. Molina's vocals, aided by slight pedal-steel, smooth over one of his finest lyrics to the point of inscrutability. ""Shiloh"", from 2007's Sojourner box set, also receives a new treatment, this one an improvement, but the rehashing is a curious decision for an artist who claims to have recorded six albums since Sojourner. More distressing is that ""Shiloh"" and ""Whip-poor-will"" stand as the best, most resplendent songs on Josephine, the latter's strong-willed confession and subsequent plea to heaven putting to shameÂ Molina's unspecific ramblings about horizons and ""when the fire didn't answer to the flame"" elsewhere. Molina has cautioned us from reading Josephine as an epitaph for Farrell, and it's just as well: Separating mourning from Molina's usual wistfulness is like trying to parse black and beige grains of sand.Â The one change Josephine offers is tradingÂ Fading Trails' penchant for bombastic guitar for a more varied set of arrangements. ""Little Sad Eyes"" marries Molina's early-years amelodicism to a peppery Hammond organ. Too-short closer ""An Arrow in the Gale"" invites, finally, Molina's bandmates onto a chorus, and they implore the title character (don't go searching hard for a narrative) to ""run run run."" ""The Rock of Ages"" is awkward and a bit hard to take, but it's Molina's first real stab at incorporating 1950s vocal-pop into his songwriting, that era's fascination with teenage tragedy and heartbreak a natural fit for Molina's mythmaking. So the croon remains, but please don't read this as a love letter to an artist's younger, now-gone days.Â Josephine is the first Molina album to suggest that he's learned anything more than bombast from those classic rock albums he's been accused of aping. There are real, new stylistic portents here. But Josephine mostly suggests new directions rather than moving in them, and the traceless ache of its muddy middle-third (""Hope Dies Last"", ""The Handing Down"", ""Map of the Falling Sky"") is burdensome.Â  So we wait, still, but judging by those six albums on the docket, we won't wait long.","Billed as a comparatively sparse counterpoint to Magnolia's recent classic-rock material,Â Josephine is the first Jason Molina album in three years.

Blood Oath,Suffocation,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5815e6ef95969320af9/1:1/w_160/9f2580f4.jpg,2009-07-20 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13331-blood-oath/,Nuclear Blast,"Death metal is a feeling, not just a style. Yes, it has parameters. It includes growling vocals, blastbeats, and riffs that ideally should sound like murder. No, it is not all metal that is abrasive, a shorthand laymen often employ. Out of metal's many subgenres, death metal sounds the biggest and most masculine. That's neither positive nor negative. The music has simply evolved that way since Death and Possessed pushed thrash to harder, faster extremes in the late 1980s. Hear enough death metal, and one will recognize it, even ""get it,"" without needing a definition. (Most music is like this.) Suffocation have had that feeling from the start. Formed 20 years ago in Long Island, the band has never let up. Suffocation are unique in death metal for being technical without sacrificing atmosphere. Many metal bands are more fleet-fingered than Suffocation. But generally, the more musical gymnastics a band undertakes, the less edge it has. Death metal pioneers like Obituary and Asphyx sounded evil as hell with riffs children could play. The genre does achieve a certain rush sometimes by flinging thousands of notes at the listener. But Suffocation remain one of the few bands to do so well. Their secret? Not playing too fast. Sure, drummer Mike Smith whips up a mighty storm. But it's not so fast that he loses power. He is renowned for inventing a style that involves hitting snare, hi-hat, and kick drum all at once. Essentially, Smith turns his kit into a jackhammer. His bandmates gear up and down with him in perfect synchronicity. Suffocation are like a gigantic vehicle with a very rough ride. Blood Oath best crystallizesÂ Suffocation's formula. The band has finally gotten production that's powerful yet clear. Subpar sound has hampered much of Suffocation's career. Here all the instruments are balanced and legible. Frank Mullen's growls are surprisingly understandable. Once again he spews tales of madness, megalomania, and paranoia. Suffocation still evoke a bunch of guys jamming together because there's nothing else to do in Long Island. They just got really good at their instruments. Tracks like ""Images of Purgatory"" and ""Cataclysmic Purification"" are not songs so much as battering rams. Yet they often bleed bursts of melody-- keening, upper-register laments. These drape atmosphere over the downtuned bulldozing underneath. Terrance Hobbs' axe rips out big hunks of riffs. Warm, thick lines flow from bassist Derek Boyer like blood from a large animal. Suffocation have many imitators; an entire metal subgenre, deathcore, essentially rips them off with a commercial slant. But nothing substitutes for the original. It's not new and improved so much as older, bigger, and a hell of a lot stronger.","With the most powerful yet clear production of Suffocation's career, Blood Oath best crystallizes their death metal formula.

Change Remains,Starlight Mints,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46f9d034d5c69bf3080/1:1/w_160/fbaac936.jpg,2009-07-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13097-change-remains/,Barsuk,"After three albums of solidly composed, occasionally brilliant indie rock songs in chamber pop drag, it was probably the right time for Starlight Mints to stretch out and change their formula. Though their 2006 record Drowaton proved a mastery of their niche-- if you're in the market for an excellent facsimile of early David Bowie, by all means seek out the standout track ""Seventeen Devils""-- it also indicated that the group's songwriter Allan Vest was running out of ideas, save for adding yet more layers to his already lush and overstuffed arrangements. As its title implies, Change Remains is a clear turning point for the band, but weirdly, also something of a holding pattern. Though Vest has downplayed his string section in favor of emphasizing white boy funk akin to MGMT's singles or an off-brand Of Montreal, his songs are marked by a stiff fussiness that neutralizes even his best grooves. Taken at face value, the melodic bass lines that serve as the basis for the songs on Change Remains are above average, and Vest's instincts as a composer are pretty good. The problem here is not in the writing, but in the execution: The bass parts seem too flimsy and fragile for actual dancing, and most of them come off like pain-stakingly crafted replicas of funk hooks intended strictly for display purposes. This isn't always a problem-- ""Sesame (Untie the Wrath)"" and ""Zoomba"" have enough juice in their grooves to at least inspire some half-hearted swaying during headphone listening-- but it's hard to shake off the sense that Vest is not yet fully comfortable working in this mode. Many great songs play up tightness at the service of body-moving funk, but too much of this music sounds more uptight than taut, and the general vibe of the record is like being invited to a house party in which the host hovers around the room, terrified that a guest may spill some beer on their carpeting. Starlight Mints may be foregrounding their rhythm section, but they still shine the brightest when they fall back on their strengths as an orchestral pop outfit. The string accents in ""Sesame"" and ""Black Champagne"" are by far the most exciting and appealing textures in their respective arrangements, and ""40 Fingers"", a goofy number that could have fit in easily on their debut album, betrays a natural confidence lacking in the flat-footed beats of tracks like ""Natural"" and ""Power Bleed"". This is not to say the band should have stayed within its comfort zone. There are good ideas all over Change Remains, but the band does not fully connect with its own material. There is a good possibility that these songs may come to life in the context of a live performance, or more likely, that this work is the necessary first step towards more effective and refined versions of similar ideas on future records. Ideally, Vest should work towards finding a happy medium between the generous melodicism of his earlier records, and the physicality of this music. It may be best to think of Change Remains like a failed attempt to cook a new dish from scratch: This first try may have turned out bland and overcooked, but with a few adjustments, the next batch may yield something rather wonderful.","After three LPs of solidly composed, occasionally brilliant indie songs in chamber-pop drag,Â Starlight Mints have stretched out and changed their formula.

Always Wrong,Wolf Eyes,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5749d034d5c69bf32d7/1:1/w_160/fb33c6ff.jpg,2009-07-20 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13320-always-wrong/,Hospital,"If you're wondering whether record labels still matter, consider the case of Wolf Eyes. Their last two widely distributed albums, 2004's Burned Mind and 2006's Human Animal, came out on Sub Pop and got lots of media attention, even landing the band on the cover of The Wire. Three years later, Wolf Eyes return with Always Wron**g, a follow-up of sorts after reams of smaller-run releases. It came out on Hospital in May, and I can't find a single review beyond a few blog entries and tweets. Even The Wire hasn't mentioned it. This probably doesn't matter much to John Olson, Nate Young, and Mike Connelly, and it shouldn't. The workman-like Michigan trio keeps plugging along, crafting massive textures, severe sonics, and daunting tension from all kinds of sources. They must be happier back among their brethren (Hospital is run by their comrade Dominick Fernow of Prurient) than on Sub Pop, but ultimately they must not care much about who pays attention. If they did, they'd smooth out their aggressive, uncompromising noise. As Always Wrong shows, such change is not an option. Wolf Eyes long ago internalized buzzing static, piercing screams, and crashing cacophony-- basic elements as essential to the band's vocabulary as finger picking is to John Fahey's, or violin drone is to Tony Conrad's. In fact, the most impressive thing about the band at this point in their career is how instantly identifiable their unruly noise is. Reference points remain, such as the industrial bombast of Throbbing Gristle, the gothic dirge of Swans, and the sheer extremity of Whitehouse. But Wolf Eyes now speak their own language exclusively. On Always Wrong, that language is more literal, at least verbally. Young's vocals are less buried in the mix than before, and his lyrics are not only discernible, they're even printed in the CD booklet. This gives the band the feel of a post-apocalyptic jazz trio, with Young playing snarling bandleader to Olson and Connelly's destructive anti-rhythm section. ""All I want is what I see,"" he moans with a Johnny Rotten-like sneer on opener ""Cellar"", spitting into the surrounding noise until it rises up and drowns him. On ""Living Stone"", he slobbers like a stunned David Yow over a mesh of screech and rattle, while the subtly-titled ""We All Hate You"" is practically a voice-percussion duet between Young and a construction-site beat. The increased clarity of Young's vocals accompanies a shift in the band's flow. Where Burned Mind and Human Animal relied on cycles of tension and release, alternating sparse lurch with slamming bombast, Always Wrong is more interested in constant build. You won't find many fist-pump moments here, but that doesn't mean the band has abandoned crescendos-- more that the album itself is one elongated climax. Such descriptions may make the albumÂ seem musical, and in relative terms it is. But Wolf Eyes remain as confrontational and forbidding as ever. Take the title track, which bears the rhythmic remnants of a demolished hardcore jam, but to the uninitiated will sound more like a broken hearing test than a song. Yet for anyone attuned to the subtle differences between each overloaded whine, harrowing clang, and psychotic drone, Always Wrong offers a lot to lose your mind in.","Michigan noise trio keeps plugging along, crafting massive textures, severe sonics, and daunting tension from all kinds of sources.

Totems Flare,Clark,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a535ea9e61561daa50a2/1:1/w_160/d6f641f7.jpg,2009-07-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13268-totems-flare/,Warp,"Think about the basic properties of beat-oriented electronic music. It emphasizes dynamic action, feelings of speed, impressions of light-- extremes and intricacies of sensation. It tweaks your senses with creative deformations of time and space, with strictly engineered frameworks lurking beneath sleek or gaudy facades. And as Simon Reynolds credibly argued in Energy Flash/Generation Ecstasy, it strives to create experiences instead of describing them. Doesn't it sound a lot like the state fair, and make it seem crazy that tinny speakers still blast mostly rock, rap, and country hits across the rides? Imagine LindstrÃ¸m's slopes and plunges on your roller coaster; the Field's nested spins on the Tilt-A-Whirl. In an obscure corner of the midway, Chris Clark mans the funhouse. He lays out certain conditions-- dark twisty passageways, treacherous stairs, and moving platforms-- but doesn't suggest that you experience them in any particular way. His songs are divided into bizarre chambers of clashing design. He's the rare case where a heavy-handedly metaphorical approach like this seems defensible. In interviews, Clark holds forth at length on process and ideas while neatly sidestepping taxonomical points. He has his go-to tricks: His specialty is the cataclysmic anthem, cobbled together from homemade break beats, glitchy jags of Euro- and acid-house, pockets of concussive noise, honeycombed synth lines, and contoured masses of distortion, all piled up in lunging heaps of coarse texture. He really doesn't seem to make any type of music, which means that there's no background proposition or guideline, and metaphor might be the only way to talk about it. As in the funhouse, you have to make your own way through. We enter an unspoken contract with the funhouse: To be tripped, mocked, and have our skirts looked up in a spirit of good-natured mischief. It's the same with Clark, and at his best, he honors it. His greatest record, 2006's exquisitely convulsed Body Riddle, was full of spaces as deeply habitable as they were impossible. It was an alchemist's album-- violent where it naturally should have been tranquil (and vice-versa); corporeal where it should have been cerebral (ditto). The acid squelches of ""Herzog"" were weirdly serene and grounding, their ambient atmosphere charged with live-wire menace. It was, unquestionably, his most humane album. But the same body Clark celebrated in 2006 was trampled under the war-tank treads of last year's Turning Dragon, a fascinating but dyspeptic album that it's difficult to imagine anyone wanting to listen to very often. As on Turning Dragon, Clark's tricks are all in place on Totems Flare, but the abstracts that made Body Riddle great are spottily present. It lacks a certain tenderness or reticence, and there's no implication of a compact with the listener, an assurance that this inhospitable space is ultimately for their pleasure. Put it this way: You would probably decline to ride a roller coaster designed by the Clark of this album, not trusting that its promise of danger wouldn't be taken to its logical conclusion, the car separating from the tracks. Totems Flare regains a measure of hospitality from its predecessor, but it brings only one new idea to the table-- Clark's singing, which is only partially effective. It works pretty well when he pitches his deep, roughshod voice toward dilapidated grandeur: ""Growls Garden"" imagines Matthew Dear's Asa Breed as interpreted by Thomas Brinkmann. But his cyber-Teutonic turn on ""Rainbow Voodoo"" is a bit silly. Clark's voice works best when he uses it like just another sound source; say, as a stuttering, FX-laden pulse in ""Look Into the Heart Now"". Your attention is drawn to details like this because the compositions often feel under-imagined as songs. The aforementioned tracks make the first half of the album feel jumbled and cluttered. The fizzy syncopation of opener ""Outside Plume"" is enticing, but its lumbering synths and beat-dropping tangents thwart its momentum. Things do start coming together after the utilitarian vamp ""Luxman Furs"": ""Totem Crackerjack"" uses gusts of noise to enhance, not derail, its cadence, and has a confidently measured stride that carries it intelligibly from breakneck drums to delicate arpeggios. The home stretch has a satisfying continuity-- the revved-up but beatific ""Future Daniel"" runs into the rewinding ambiance of ""Primary Balloon Landing""; the dark drive of ""Talis"" and ""Suns of Temper"" dissolves into the gentle guitar whorls of closer ""Absence"". That's how funhouses are supposed to work-- we know the chaos is an illusion, designed for our enjoyment by an orderly hand. Otherwise, they're just confusing and enervating.","The imaginative IDM producer behind 2006's awesome Body Riddle adds his own voice to the mix and increases the clatter, to mixed results.

Riceboy Sleeps,Riceboy Sleeps,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57dea9e61561daa5150/1:1/w_160/4dba3b67.jpg,2009-07-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13328-riceboy-sleeps/,XLParlophone,"Ever since ÃgÃ¦tis Byrjun pushed wigs back a decade ago, every subsequent Sigur RÃ³s release felt like it had to respond to the same question: did we all get duped into falling for some New Age hokum with a really great gimmick? And each time, there was a reason to emphatically answer ""no,"" whether it was () and its extraterrestrial fragility, Takk's advance into verdant pop forms, theÂ Hvarf/Heim curtain-reveal, and then last year's MeÃ° suÃ° Ã­ eyrum viÃ° spilum endalaustat least had ""Gobbledigook"" going for it. But after ""Gobbledigook"" hinted at surprisingly concise melodic smarts (as well as a dialogue with American indie trends), most of MeÃ° feasted on their most overcooked arrangements yet, leaving the listener to wonder whether SigurÂ RÃ³sÂ had much desire or incentive to really mess with a sound that made them arguably the most successful post-rock act of all time. That issue is one that could ostensibly be resolved by Jonsi Birgisson's Riceboy Sleeps project, recorded with his musical and romantic partner, Alex Somers. Depending on how you look at it, by that measure, Riceboy Sleeps can be considered a defiant statement, doing a full-on cannonball into Pure Moods bubble bath: Birgisson and Somers keep the lush orchestration and elastic song lengths of SigurÂ RÃ³s, but break rank by all but eliminating rock-based textures and structures, and most startlingly, the iconic part of the band's sound-- Jonsi's own voice. I'll be quite honest: When I first tried to tackle this thing as a whole, I fucking hated it. That's not really the response a record that goes so far out of its way to sooth should elicit. But regardless of Eno, Stars of the Lid, and Mountains being a staple of a listener's balanced diet, you always run that risk approaching ambient music while otherwise being in the verse/chorus mindset. But what struck me as most frustrating about 20 minutes in was just how indecisive it sounds about its ambience-- too deconstructed, patient, and ethereal to really qualify as pop music obviously. But it's also too ostentatious (is the average track length of eight and a half minutes really earned?) and well, loud to even fit the bill as background music, the dynamics static and nearly suffocating. Brevity is the soul of wit and all, but then again, Jonsi's never really been known for his sense of humor. Despite being recorded entirely on acoustic instruments, much of Riceboy's components will be familiar to those experienced with Birgisson's previous work: the guest appearances from string group Amiina, melodic passages composed on piano but drifting in gusts of reverb like windchimes, choirs that are used as much for texture as they are for melody. That compilation hardly needed a breather, but amidst the tracks that only hinted at texture, ""Happiness"" played like a nine-minute sweep of a cool palm across a sweaty brow. Perhaps it's the familiarity or just its presence as the first track that makes it the relative entry point or ""accessible"" single, but regardless of how resolute and patient the chording is, ""Happiness"" finds itself to be comparatively more form-fitting than what surrounds it. Considering that Riceboy Sleeps is also a 52-page, wordless book by Somers and Birgisson, as well as a visual project, there's the idea that, yes, you're really not meant to swallow this thing whole unless you want to feel like a goose on its way to pÃ¢tÃ© status by funneling indulgent but indistinct sweeteners. Broken down into (relatively) manageable seven-to-eight minute chunks, one can summon up the patience to drift along. There's no percussion per se on Riceboy Sleeps, but nice touches of percussive sound-- the rock tumbler-like samples on ""Indian Summer"", which recalls the understated and underrated work of Helios. Within the span of nine minutes instead of the robust 68, it's easier to look forward to the choir sighs of ""Atlas Song"", the occasional wave of distortion and static of ""Stokksyri"", and even the curiosity of ""Boy 1904"", containing a recording of the last castrato. In the end, the question surrounding Riceboy Sleeps recalls that of similarly unwieldy and user-dictated content from Flaming Lips' Zaireeka to Nine Inch Nails' Year Zero-- is it worthwhile to evaluate a recorded document based on how the listener is most likely to experience it? Put together, Riceboy Sleeps is an admirable, intensely personal labor of love from a guy who's risking risibility by the mere matter of including the word ""sleep"" in its title, and although ""DanÃ­ell in the Sea"" and ""All the Big Trees"" do little remarkable on their own merits, when combined with the arresting videos found on the Riceboy Sleeps website, you start to understand its motivation more thoroughly. And really, as long as you don't give it your undivided attention, Riceboy Sleeps can keep you company in your cubicle or gridlock traffic, though I realize that's not exactly as riveting as ""if there's one ambient album you own this year...!"" But in a necessarily faceless artistic milieu, a Sigur RÃ³s Stamp of Approval might make that the case anyway.","Sigur RÃ³s'Â Jonsi Birgisson unveils a new project, an all-acoustic duo created with Alex Somers.

Until the Earth Begins to Part,Broken Records,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a576c0084474cd0c071e/1:1/w_160/27be41fc.jpg,2009-07-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13322-until-the-earth-begins-to-part/,4AD,"The title of ""If The News Makes You Sad, Don't Watch It"" is not played for laughs. Nothing on this record is. But there's a line where Broken Records soapboxer Jamie Sutherland bellows, ""from the couch here, I plead apathy."" Unless he's being non-autobiographical, the only natural response upon hearing the rest of Until the Earth Begins to Part is to call bullshit. This album is meant to inspire a sort of lurking dread that you're not doing enough things with your life, and as such, ""apathetic"" ranks as one of the least-accurate words to describe it. Like a high-school junior volunteering his Saturday at a rescue home, it's concerned, intense, and very much motivated. And like that same person, whatever altruistic intent they have is overshadowed by being so goddamn serious, they're impossible to bear for more than a half hour. I hesitate to bring up that an influential UK publication called them ""the Scottish Arcade Fire"" because on the surface, that's the sort of simplistic catch-all comparison that a band spends the rest of their career unfairly trying to live down. But it's helpful in terms of figuring out where everything went wrong-- rather than Funeral catharsis, Sutherland abides by Neon Bible tendency to blunt and oversensationalize. With that, I suppose there's no other choice for this sort of cheap-seats bound stuff than to deal with governmental distrust, post-apocalyptic prophesying, and childlike wonder at the inner workings of one's body: you'll find it completely against type to even acknowledge such a mundane household fixture as a couch. Instead, much of Until the Earth comes off like the narrator from ""Windowsill"" still telling these damn kids to get off his lawn. Broken Records certainly believe in the redemptive power of a bunch of people playing instruments at the same time, particularly if they're chamber pieces like glockenspiel, balalaika, mandolin, and horns. If they can all come in after two or more minutes of piano piddling that comes off like narcoleptic Blue Nile (""Wolves"", ""Nearly Home""), even better. But we really shouldn't go any further without addressing this record's-- and until further notice, this band's-- biggest problem, namely, Sutherland going full-on diva like life is a big commercial. Typically, ""bad"" vocalists are known as such if they're on the bland side or can't hit notes, but what about giving no quarter whatsoever to what the other guys in the band are doing? I guess it's probably not in Sutherland's best interests to let the lyrics speak for themselves, but he never exhibits awareness of his surroundings, toggling between overbearing brogue and overbearing falsetto to the point where Jeff Buckley sounds like Guru by comparison. Where Broken Records' ""twist"" comes in is their adherence to folk stylings, ""folk"" usually meaning a double-time drum beat and some tiny stringed instrument playing the front. Sure, even if a Coldplay/Gogol Bordello hybrid would possibly slay Coachella, I'm not sure if there's really much breathing room in that Venn diagram. The track that attempts to set up shop in that region (""A Good Reason"") sounds suspiciously similar to ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" without the kickass solos, and I seriously doubt they were looking to go there. Still, it's almost admirable just how easy of a target Broken Records make themselves again and again here-- go ahead, Google the name ""Eilert LÃ¸vborg."" He's the inspiration for the track ""If Eilert LÃ¸vborg Wrote a Song, It Would Sound Like This"", and it'll certainly play well with undergrads who are into songs for the mere fact that they're written from the perspective of Ibsen characters who romantically can't moderate their behavior. It turns out to be pretty embarrassing straight-from-Cliff's Notes fan-fic, and an unbelievably obvious unintentional metaphor for a record. Yet, it seems sorta disingenuous to criticize Until The Earth as being overblown, since there's no way that wasn't Broken Records' intent. Hell, I suppose I should congratulate them for accomplishing their goals of either turning mid-00s collective soul-indie into a spectacle worthy of the ""Hate Me Now"" video or at least making Glasvegas sound like a bunch of underfunded chumps. Still, if the music can be moving on its own merits, there's no need to be this damn pushy.","Very, very serious Scottish bandÂ believes hard in the redemptive power of a bunch of people playing instruments at the same time.

The Great Cessation,YOB,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57cea9e61561daa514d/1:1/w_160/64b68966.jpg,2009-07-17 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13327-the-great-cessation/,Profound Lore,"Infinite shades of black exist even within metal subgenres. ""Doom metal,"" for example, has diversified so much that the term doesn't mean much beyond down-tuned guitars and slow tempos. The tree from which all doom (and metal in general) springs is Black Sabbath. Sabbath lead to the bluesy stylings of ""stoner doom"" of Sleep and Electric Wizard.Â The doom tree also has stranger branches-- ""death doom"" (death metal + doom metal) hybrids like Coffins and Hooded Menace; ""sludge doom"" like Eyehategod and Sourvein from the American South; the astral density of the UK's Esoteric; grandfather clock bongs a thousand years wide from their compatriots Moss. Oregon's YOB have carved out a niche of ""cosmic doom,"" which is a descriptor, not a subgenre. Few bands do what YOB do-- marry Black Sabbath's heavy and psychedelic sides. Sabbath did both equally well. But when they wheeled out acoustic guitars and bongo drums, they were just taking a break. YOB keep the pressure up, driving riffs into subterranean depths, yet sending melodies spiraling skyward. 2005's The Unreal Never Lived perfected such duality. It found the intersection among roaring guitars, yoga class, black light dreams, and white light ecstasy. Black Sabbath with Dio as singer changed their name to Heaven and Hell for legal reasons. Had they followed through sonically, YOB might have resulted. YOB's discography is variations on this theme-- again, shades of black. The band is mostly a one-man project by singer/guitarist Mike Scheidt, with different rhythm sections over the years. Even a detour in 2007 as Middian was YOB-like, with more diverse speeds and tones. Middian lasted only one album due to a trademark dispute with Wisconsin metal band Midian. The lawsuit took a lot out of Scheidt, both financially and personally. The Great Cessation perhaps reflects this. It has YOB's signature 10-ton riffs and glacial tempos. But their delivery is more vulnerable now. The band sounds a little weary. Scheidt's Dave Mustaine-esque wail is ragged and desperate. The theme of damaged vision recurs throughout: ""burning eyes brim with tears""; ""thorn in the eye, gods that are blind""; ""tears of lead""; ""eyes like magnets."" At one point, ""The Lie That Is Sin"" breaks down to a single, naked guitar. Of course, it builds back up to surging peaks. But the attack is no longer a galactic wall of sound. Sanford Parker's production is partly responsible. It's more rock and less metal. The tones are darker and leaner than before. All this makes for a surprisingly human YOB record. Before, the band strode on astral planes. Now heaven and hell are closer to earth.","With theirÂ signature 10-ton riffs and glacial tempos, fewÂ bands do what YOB do-- marry Black Sabbath's heavy and psychedelic sides.

Chemical Warfare,The Alchemist,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57ec0084474cd0c0733/1:1/w_160/29f2a905.jpg,2009-07-17 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13329-chemical-warfare/,E1,"The Alchemist's second solo record, a follow-up to the equally rock-solid 1st Infantry, is future-horror music, a cinematic soundtrack that crosses sci-fi pastiche with hardheaded ignorance of underground street rap. It's not an entirely novel concept-- the lead-off track sampling the theme from A Clockwork Orange makes that much obvious-- but it's exceptionally well-crafted in a way that eludes many of the artists who've fucked with this formula in the past. It helps that the Alchemist plays well to a lengthy guestlist of rappers with heavyweight street gravitas. As a rapper, Alc is still a pretty ignorable presence who can pull off some tracks as long as his lyrical honesty makes up for his poor vocal impression. But what makes this record work is Alchemist's balanced blend of creativity, craft, and atmosphere, a real underground rap record that works best when it plays to its strengths. The beats are, of course, the main attraction. The claustrophobia, a mood so common to underground hardcore, is less about the dusty breakbeats of New York rap history; Alc's instrumentation is modern, smooth, and crisp, haunting less with texture than by strangled melody and the interplay of percussive beats with raspier rappers. ""Lose Your Life"", for example, is all swooping strings racing around bells that seem like the soundtrack to Dracula's mansion over minimal drum snaps. ""That'll Work"", meanwhile, is one of the year's best hip-hop tracks; over a bleeping sheet of computer sound, Juvenile and Three 6 Mafia spit inspired verses, accompanied by sudden jittery 16th-note bass stabs. The hook's eerie vocal samples are scratched less as a signifier of rap tradition than as disquieting affect. ""On Sight"" is another highlight; the Dogg Pound rap with classic West Coast lyrical dexterity over ominous bass burps and stuttered snares. Eminem's return to form on the title track is a return to classic ignorant shock rap-- essentially, the kind of thing that made him worth hearing, even though it meant the eye-rolling homophobia of a ""couple of fags stuffed in the back seat muzzled and gagged."" A double-edged sword, less easily-ignorable coming from a full-grown established star. That said, his return to these more clever lyrical roots is so engaging that you have to wonder when this was actually recorded. It's not all darkness and future-street noir, though; the listener gets some space to breathe,Â with the soulful Maxwell-assisted ""Smile"", featuring an impressive verse from Twista. Alchemist again walks a thin line between justifying his flaccid delivery with smart lyrics, and undercutting those lyrics with his paltry vocals. But it's the ominous lightning-and-thunder horror film moments where the record really takes shape: Rappers like Prodigy, Lil Fame, Jadakiss, Pusha T, and the Dogg Pound ""shine,"" a word that feels wholly inappropriate for the grime-encrusted sonic background of the LP. The only real ignorable moment comes on the noodle-y, overlong, and boring ""Therapy"". Chemical Warfare blends the grimy vibe of classic underground East Coast rap with the coast-to-coast who's who of rugged real rap, with highlights from New York lyrical heads (Fabolous) to brass knuckles bomb throwers (Lil Fame), down south legends (Juvenile) to the rugged West Coast street shit (Dogg Pound). Tying it all together is the Alchemist's allegiance to craft, but never at the expense of creativity; this kind of sci-fi cinema meets underground rap ruggedness has been done before, but not with this much agility. Chemical Warfare is a rap version of Speilberg's Minority Report; it draws upon a gritty underground past while embracing more modern craftsmanship, where new smooth edges are balanced by the felt-authenticity of its caliginous vision.","Alchemist's second solo recordÂ is future-horror music, a cinematic soundtrack that crosses sci-fi pastiche with hardheaded ignorance of underground street rap.

Ty Segall / Lemons,Ty Segall,by: Stephen M.

His follow-up, Lemons, is out just a few months later on Memphis-based Goner Records, run by the Oblivians' Eric Friedl. Pretend his next one is out on Siltbreeze and it's not hard to triangulate Segall's sound. His short, sharp songs peal out of the garage without raising the doors, sending 1960s rock riffs crashing through splintered, smart-ass lo-fi buzz. After spending time in San Francisco's the Traditional Fools, Segall went way solo, playing early shows all by himself: Alone on stage, he strummed a beat-up guitar, howled his lyrics, and worked a kickdrum with a tambourine duct-taped to it. He has recently started playing with a band, but still believes that all a song really needs is whatever one person can strike, strum, sing, or shake. This no-fuss, no-frills DIY philosophy defines both of his albums, but especially the rough-and-tumble Ty Segall. It actually sounds like the product of one man, all the instruments he could carry, and an hour's worth of studio time. It kicks off with the guitar and tambourine strut of ""Go Home"", with Segall's vocals drenched in harsh reverb that doesn't conceal but enhances the song's concise melodies. He's enamored with 60s pop rhythms, so you could conceivably do the Shag or the Mashed Potato to ""The Drag"" or ""So Alone"". But his is a limited, limiting set-up, and at times his run-throughs sound obligatory. He apes Jon Spencer aping Elvis Presley on ""Pretty Baby (You're So Ugly)"", saving the song only with a breakneck distortion chorus. Ultimately, Ty Segall sounds like a test run, a document of an artist discovering what all he can do by himself, which makes moments like the whistled outro on ""Watching You"", so reminiscent of Sergio Leone, all the more endearing. Musically and chronologically, Ty Segall and Lemons make a good pair, not only because together they add up to about 50 minutes, but because the latter builds confidently on the experiments of the former. Segall coaxes a greater range of sounds from his set-up, touching on a bit of psychedelic country on ""Rusted Dust"", frenzied gutter-punk fury on ""Johnny"", and hallucinatory desert rock on the Captain Beefheart cover ""Drop Out Boogie"". ""In Your Car"" stomps with the brat-menace of Black Lips, and the instrumental ""Untitled #2"" builds its surf rock from the ground up, establishing a fast rhythm section of rimshots and acoustic strums before introducing the barreling lead guitar and wiping out spectacularly at the end. Buffed to a relative shine, these songs are leaner, more frenetic, and simply more imaginative. With this one-two punch, Segall enters a lo-fi field crowded with artists mining similar influences for inspiration and making similarly compact noise. What distinguishes him from his peers, however, is his ability to instill his songs with a palpable creative zeal, as if the final recordings were less important than the process of performing them. All of his noble goals of prolificacy and spontaneity would be meaningless if his energy and excitement didn't cut through the noise loud and clear.","Sophomore release on Goner records builds confidently on the experimental, 1960s-inspired lo-fi rock of last year's self-titled debut.

Since all jj choose to show of themselves is their music, video, and occasional blood-spattered merch, then those Sincerely Yours catalogue numbers represent the sum total of what we know about them. Hell, we wouldn't even know jj were a ""them"" had the group's Gothenburg, Sweden-based, Tough Alliance-owned label not confirmed that. So... they're mysterious-- but not inscrutable:Â Despite a brief discography that's already geekily byzantine enough for anybody who ever bought into the legend of Factory Records, jj's full-length debut is as easy to enjoy as whatever the last CD was you brought home with a giant cannabis leaf on the cover. They're as naive as they are cynical-- or is it the other stupid way around?-- and they manage to be pretty, touching, funny, and motivating, in different ways, in all the right places, for nine songs lasting 28 minutes. You don't need me to tell you for the 128th time (320th if you're at CD quality) how digital file distribution has spread sounds and ideas across the globe during the current decade, and jj have earned a place among the current wave of pop globalization, sharing both the island sounds and sticky-fingered irreverence of their labelmatesÂ the Tough Alliance, Air France, and the Honeydrips. Sure, jj stillÂ carry traces of iconic twee label Sarah Records, but they celebrate a broader definition of ""pop"".Â Sometimes, as on ""Lollipop""-biting slo-mo raver ""Ecstasy"", jj do this by borrowing from global hip-hop culture. But they also participate. Never by straight-up rapping, but by expanding the reach of ambient music-- defined expansively, as Brian Eno once did, as music that ""suggests, a place, a landscape, a soundworld which you inhabit""-- to include a whole new kind of swagger. ""Of course there is people out to get me,"" a female vocalist sings on ""My Hopes and Dreams"" as hand percussion evokes the Avalanches' beach blowouts, hypnotic guitar recalls German Kosmiche Muzik, and gusts of winds whistle over high-noon Ennio Morricone strings. Then again, on the same song, jj's singer just wants ""someone to share my hopes and dreams with""-- a humbler goal to be sure, but jj excel just as much at strummy intimacy as they do at lavish blissouts. The lo-fi hooks on ""Tell It to My Heart""-biting closer ""Me & Dean"" suggests TTA's aching teen-pop cover ""Lucky"", only done as an original this time. The pisstake-y giggles also make you wonder if you're hearing their mixtape outro. When jj drift closer to early-1990s ambient-house, they still allow emotion to flood through the textures, and they never start repeating themselves. Opener ""Things Will Never Be the Same Again"" sets almost new-agey strings and Enya-esque sailing imagery to a bouncy Caribbean rhythm: ""I close my eyes and remember/ A place in the sun where we used to live."" For all the flickering synths and rainforest percussion of ""Masterplan"", we also get Top Gun guitar rocketry, faux-innocent-as-Disney sing-song, and that reporter guy from YouTube going, ""I'm dyin' in this fucking country-ass fucked-up town."" jj nÂ° 2 may be easy on the ears, but it isn't wallpaper. At their most ideal, ambient, hip-hop, punk, and the most crassly commercial pop all have in common an ""anything goes"" approach. Like any ideal, this usually gets fucked up pretty fast. ""New Age"" harnesses ambient's chill-out pleasantness to eco-politics and yuppie mysticism; old rappers start dissing younger rappers for not following in their footsteps or being more socially conscious; the punk and indie traditions become as idol-worshiping as the classic-rockers they sought to displace. jj obliterate that bullshit and get back to a place where Lil Wayne can be ambient, and Enya can show up on an album with a pot leaf on the cover. Free mp3 ""From Africa to MÃ¡laga"", on some days my favorite track on the album, is almost as suited for a cruise-ship commercial as Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"". But it also faces Important Ideas like death and art with the clear-eyed precocity of an adolescent, riding in on trade winds with a message that could speak to middle-school cheerleaders and middle-aged soccer moms and middlebrow-loathing former punks alike: ""The thought that you found/ Takes you to town/ Smashes your face/ Burns out your heart/ Then you go home and turn it into art."" Pop's just fine, too, thanks.","Another mysterious outfit from Sweden making the kind of warm, sunny Balearic pop the region has become known for, but jj do it much better than most.

Or maybe they really never did fit in-- though they had Dave Fridmann behind the boards at the peak of his powers, he got there by producing bands like Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev who embodied completely opposite attitudes. And though they were at the peak of their powers when domestic listeners were turning their ears to the British Isles, they were the kind of listeners so turned off by Kid A that they were deluded into thinking Coldplay and Travis bore any resemblance to The Bends. *And now upon the release of his solo debut, *Lord Cut-Glass, Delgados frontman Alun Woodward is still a misfit, even in his own home. While Scotland has been known as of late for producing romantic anthem-toters with bleeding hearts and bleeding ears, Woodward is still the kid in the back of the poetry class casting spitballs. Lyrically, Lord Cut-Glass could be mistaken for Hate's sequel, a call for the utter negation of social contracts. ""Even Jesus Couldn't Love You"" is a sprawling, initially awkward composition of taunts at an anonymous no-hoper (""did your pony not wuvv you?"") that swings between a verse melody that tensely and steadily nudges upward and mantra-like repetition of the song's says-it-all title. But if Woodward is still wheelhousing it as a wordsmith, Lord Cut-Glass is a significantly more singer-songwriterly affair musically. It's a relative claim: There's still strings all over the place, either mocking in their pizzicato affectations or swaddling madrigal-like minor keys (""You Know"", ""Toot Toot""), and a female vocalist who sounds suspiciously like his fellow Delgados hatemonger Emma Pollock. ""Jesus"" and ""Look After Your Wife"" give off the impression that Lord Cut-Glass could be undercut by overly distracted composition, but most of its remainder is built on a chassis of cowboy chords (""Holy Fuck!"" ""I'm A Great Example to the Dogs""). But Woodward deflates the puffier song lengths and takes a melodic turn that owes more to Paul McCartney and Stuart Murdoch. ""Picasso"" has a ""Blackbird""-like acoustic lilt that's almost honestly sweet, while the brief piano ballad ""Be Careful What You Wish For"" recalls ""For No One"", a low-key indication that Woodward's sarcasm is likely a defense mechanism for genuine loneliness. Granted, this runs the risk of crossing the radar of only Delgados diehards, who would chalk this up as another one of life's inevitable letdowns: Woodward's snark can cut a little predictable and broad and he'll give into an occasional stale, eyeball-rolling rhyme. But really, Lord Cut-Glass gets an unintentional boost from the recent fortunes of Future of the Left, who rose from a similarly underappreciated act (Mclusky) even angrier and misanthropic than before-- hopefully, Woodward can make a second-album leap the same way Travels With Myself and Another did, but if Lord Cut-Glass can at least be seen as an indication that he has no plans to go soft on us, that in and of itself is a success.","Delgados frontman Alun Woodward, co-leader of one of the decade's most criminally underrated bands, makes his solo debut.

Collaboratory,Steve Bug,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5339d034d5c69bf3242/1:1/w_160/d1312ca3.jpg,2009-07-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13266-collaboratory/,Poker Flat,"I once ran into Steve Bug trying on a pair of jeans in Berlin; I had to leave the shop immediately for fear of turning into a gushing fanboy. Bug can have that effect. The night before I'd seen him play for several hours, and whether it was due to his sharp fashion sense or his endearing little dance moves behind the decks or his knack for choosing deep tunes that slowly become thoroughly gripping, he seemed awfully charismatic. His own productions adopt a different pose: in the last decade or so he's managed only a handful of anthems (chiefly his late-1990s classic ""Loverboy""), while putting out a lot of material that seems almost defiantly anonymous. This is partly because a fair amount of it is good-not-great, but even the bona fide masterpieces can slide right past you if you're not paying attention. 2005's ""Bugs in Your Brain"" is my favorite Bug moment: A deceptively fragile, airy piece of minimal house that at first seems to act only as a pretty bridge between tracks in a mix, it reveals its enormous charm through repeat playing, and the accompanying recognition that each beat and each synth chord have been placed just so to achieve an overwhelming sense of rightness. ""Fit"", rather than weirdness or populism or futurism, forms Bug's stock-in-trade. His productions invite the sort of praise you might bestow on well-designed furniture: sleek, comfortable, without visible flaw. But these traits are as elusive and enigmatic as they are unobtrusive. The difference between a good Bug production and a brilliant one is difficult to articulate, and often just comes down to context-- in the hands of a talented DJ a track can easily move from the first category to the second. Which makes Bug's own albums seem slightly ill-conceived from the start; his tracks are not designed to be heard in full, one after the other. It's not that this music is difficult or impenetrable; if anything, Bug's classicist fusion of deep house grooves, reflective post-Detroit synthesizer melodies, and slight electro affectations (all wrapped in clean, hyper-detailed Euro minimal sound design) will be pleasurably familiar to anyone who has paid the slightest attention to German dance music of the past decade. But this itself is the problem: Bug's work never shocks, and his own consistency works against him. Collaboratory is the equal of previous albums The Other Day and Sensual, but this equality also verges on exchangeability. As its title suggests, Collaboratory focuses on collaborations with other producers, but you'd be forgiven for not noticing, as the sound of the album is overwhelmingly consistent. There's much to love here. Opener ""Trees Can't Dance"" is the sort of echo-strewn, melancholy Detroit homage that any producer would kill to call to their own, its roaming, mutating synthesizer line confirming that while Bug is proudly functionalist he's never rigidly geometric. On the unnerving ""Month of Sip"" (in collaboration with the Martini Bros' DJ Cle), portentous chords and drooping, decaying synth tones slowly transform into a morose gesture towards peaktime energy, like Ãme on strong downers. ""Still Music"", with Donnacha Costello, is dreamy acid house whose seven minutes of radical uneventfulness would still be captivating if it were stretched out to 20. Meanwhile, for the romantic, mysterious vocal house of ""Trust in Me"" and ""Like It Should Be"", Bug concocts delectable, evocatively humid grooves-- all glowering bass and intricate, delicate snare patterns. In fact pretty much every track here is filled with ear-tickling sounds and uniformly sensitive production. Still, imagine how much more startling these qualities would be if they were marshaled in the service of mind-bending, unpredictable grooves, or gigantic dancefloor-slaying hooks, or simply unforgettable melodies. Bug avoids these ""easy"" options in order to focus listeners' attentions on the carefully thought-out physicality of his work; I sympathize, but despite its superlative craft Collaboratory still seems at times like a missed opportunity. For music that's so easy to like, falling in love with this stuff can feel like surprisingly hard work.","Underrated DJ/producer offers another classicist fusion of deep house grooves, reflective post-Detroit synthesizer melodies, and slight electro affectations.

You look forward to the cryptic postcards, the soon-to-be party-favored stories-- hell, you even make him an honorary member of the band. You might even try to channel his spirit animal through your new LP, however vague a seance it ends up being. This particular Johnny is also the Skygreen Leopards' Johnny, for which a good deal of their sixth proper full-length Gorgeous Johnny is about, either in body or spirit. But don't blame the man (or myth, for that matter: Johnny's name appears as much as Jehovah's, a longstanding Leopards' reference and centerpiece) for either the mild successes or countless missteps presented here; it is, for the most part, the final shake of a fruitless branch. The Leopards certainly have enjoyed a solid streak since teaming up in 2001. Anchored by Glenn Donaldson and Donovan Quinn, the San Franciscan duo (who regularly enlist orbiting friends and musicians from record to record; this one features Papercuts' Jason Quever) has long been producing Cali-fried folk concerned with extolling the virtues of blissed-out Americana. Best represented on their 2005 Surrender Jehovah EP, these seemingly straight-forward strummers and hummers can somehow bear and begin to force open the young buds of commercial-leaning psychedelia. Those songs, much like the ones here on Johnny, weren't in the least bit freaky (especially at a time when everyone clung so desperately to that tag), owning their own space within the wiggle-free barriers of the straightforward, two-and-a-half-minute song. The bulk of Gorgeous Johnny is unfortunately too earnest and too patient really to go anywhere in particular, preening like a collection of meticulously cleaned Travis demos or, at their worst, an Adam Green album without any of the dirty bits. Take for example album highlight ""Goodnight Anna"", an extremely well-crafted, simple song that is sadly rehashed and reevaluated about 12 times too many over the course of the album. It sits dead in the middle, falsely redefining the first five cuts as building blocks and ignoring any chance to eventually one-up ""Anna""'s foamy whispers and mournful twangs as the album moves along. It most fully realizes the Leopards' struggle with the bittersweetness of reminiscence and fleeting emotion, but unfortunately doesn't leave much room for any sort of creative expanse: however pacifying the rigidity of these song structures are, well... what you see is what you get. This isn't to say that everything both North and South of this astute highlight is for naught, with plenty of ideas and passing moments that manage to stick rather elegantly. Opener ""Johnny's Theme"" is a lovely little stone-kicker that helps recall lost days of butterfly-netting; ""Margery"" is a spot-on summer lament for a girl impossibly trapped inside herself for whatever reason; ""Gorgeous Johnny"" waxes Dylan over a simple little Band-indebted progression, more pleasant yet equally as plain as anything else here. It's not that there are any cataclysmic duds, though ""Dixie Cups in the Dead Grass"" ultimately tumbles over itself like a sprinting drunk, and ""SGL's, et al"" is about as repetitive and irritating as a song gets. The real problem is that the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) model needs to somehow circumvent the complacency and redundance. That, or maybe a record about your wild and flaky friends shouldn't submit to such hollow sameness.","This San Franciscan duo returns with another record of Cali-fried folk and blissed-out Americana.

Rated O,Oneida,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f8c0084474cd0c05eb/1:1/w_160/c38ecc2c.jpg,2009-07-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13215-rated-o/,JagjaguwarBrah,"Even three decades beyond the punk era, there's still a lingering urge to scoff at the supposed bloat and indulgence of the double album. Concision is often held as a virtue for many modern indie bands, and, let's face it, there are scant few double albums in rock that really have the ideas and vision to sustain their runtime. Save for prolific geniuses like Frank Zappa or Prince, the even-rarer triple album is more common for weighty anthologies, or documenting the live shows of acts with drooling fan bases, from the Grateful Dead to Pearl Jam. Sure, the ClashÂ brought us a rare triple triple album of original material at the peak of their critical capital, but even that was reviled in certain circles. So... why on earth would any band release a triple album now? Maybe you've never met Oneida. When so inclined, they'll fill a whole side of vinyl with one long track, one whole CD's running time with two or three-- and if you haven't seen them on the festival circuit lately, it's because they went ahead and started their own. The reason they can do this (aside from keeping their dayjobs) is that their fans-- being open-minded enough to absorb the many permutations of repetitive, inexhaustible rhythms, and stinging vintage organ and guitar over 10 years-- eat it right up. Those fans won't be surprised by the behemothÂ Rated O-- some have been waiting for it ever since it was planned and then scrapped before 2006'sÂ Happy New Year. Before putting the idea of a 3xCD set aside, Drummer Kid Millions told an interviewer the project was ""the stone tablets of Onieda."" Given how hard it is to nail the band down to one sound, figuring out what those tablets could be remained a mystery. The good news: Between beat-heavy studio workouts, some of their loosest instrumental jams, and their most liberal use of ""O""-related puns in song titles, Oneida were considerate enough to build it all around lean, no-frills rock on par with the best of their earlier work.Â Rated O contains the band's wildest experiments while still covering most of their previous sonic tentpoles. The first disc introduces the band as beat-hungry, dub-obsessed studio scientists, where at least 10 minutes go by before any sound resembling a guitar is discernible. While opener ""Brownout in Lagos"" is ostensibly inspired by dancehall, its rubbery and distorted beat sounds only remotely like that genre or any of Oneida's previous work. It features bona-fide toasting from Dad-Ali Ziai, but the guest is another texture in a very strange soup of radar blips, tin cans, and faraway explosions. ""What's Up, Jackal?"" begins with echoing drums and a hiccupping Eastern tone, before leading into muffled screaming and a dizzy studio collage that sounds like the aural equivalent of a strobe light, with that hiccup being the only constant. The first minute of 10 on ""10:30 at the Oasis"" has a similar fakeout before emerging into a more delirious and layered version of the sleek jams that Trans Am were later known for (which makes sense, as Trans Am's Phil Manley/Double Rainbow contributes here, alongside former Onieda axeman Papa Crazee). This first disc is new for band, fans, and unacquainted listeners alike, and there aren't a whole lot of hooks to guide anyone. As with much of Oneida's work, it starts and ends on the beat, leading listeners through percussive whirlwinds of psychedelic sound. The middle disc is closer to the band's live sound with few overdubs, and is an exemplary document of the hell the band can raise as an honest-to-god rock outfit. ""The River"" starts from Oneida's familiar monotone patter before uniting on a simple but massive-sounding theme, showing more melodic certainty and fearless classic-rock worship than they have in a while. Proto-metal riffs power spacey but insistent workouts like ""I Will Haunt You"" and ""Ghost in the Room"", while more exotic rhythms push ""The Life You Preferred""; these tracks sprint and shimmy and drone without ever losing momentum. As the sluggish chant of ""Luxury Travel"" slows to a halt, the most stretched-out part of the three-disc set begins with disc C: ""O"" is an anchorless sitar-laden haze until minute five, when the rhythm builds and the guitars coagulate around brief, hypnotic tones. ""End of Time"" is a formless, nervous drone (smoke break!) that leads into the 20-minute ""Folk Wisdom"". Make no mistake: The band is jamming. But Oneida's version of jamming tends to be a more pulsing, atmospheric, moody affair than the scale-fingering aimlessness the word probably calls to mind, and the tracks on the third disc are no exception. They don't have the same layers or utilize the studio in quite the same way as last year's instrumentalÂ Preteen Weaponry did, but marathon sessions like ""Folk Wisdom"" maintain their anxious, yearning edge while revealing the intuition and chemistry of the band through its many subtle shifts and turns. The last section ofÂ Rated O may feel like work to some, but at this point in the record (and their careers), it also feels earned. While it's not quite three discs of all killer and no filler-- the plodding anguish of ""The Human Factor"" is difficult enough the first time through--Â Rated O could stand easily as three discrete records, with each of them meriting their own release. Putting them all together is what makes it a statement: In an era when easy availability of music makes attention spans dwindle, it's an audacious listen the first time around, not to mention the repeated listens that Oneida records often reward. And as music gets increasingly reduced to a ""niche interest"" (shudder) and focuses more on the novelty of the physical package, the triple-gatefoldÂ Rated O is undoubtedly a beautiful package. More than anything,Â Rated O is part and parcel of the band's long-standing and always-increasing ambition--don't forget this massive slab is part of a triptych of albums, with the third installment yet to come. Few bands push themselves this far from their comfort zone, fewer still this late in their career-- and that slice of the pie chart gets even smaller when considering what little attention the band has received, even in indie circles, while they've continued to innovate and sweat. Maybe you've got some other Brooklyn band pegged as your creative north star-- and that's cool, this year has some contenders-- but Oneida are the only band running that I could tell a listener with a straight face, yes, it's worth three discs, and it's worth your time.","Only a band as inscrutable as Oneida would attempt a 3xCD in 2009; only a band brimming with this many ideas could pull it off.

"Live From Austin, TX",Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5775e6ef95969320ae7/1:1/w_160/0de7a62b.jpg,2009-07-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13324-live-from-austin-tx/,New West,"The Drive-By Truckers have had a pretty remarkable decade, kicking off with the ambitious, career-making double album Southern Rock Opera in 2001 and capping with the gritty short-story collection Brighter Than Creation's Dark last year. The former introduced what would become the band's favorite topic-- ""the duality of the Southern thing""-- and was so good it overcame the handicap of that awkward band name. The latter effectively expanded their scope well beyond the South, writing about Iraq vets the way Springsteen wrote about Vietnam vets in the 80s. In between, they released two great albums and one good one, as well as two solo albums from Patterson Hood and an odds'n'sods collection slated for next month. Few bands have been both so prolific and so consistent this decade. Their latest 00s release is Live From Austin, TX, a CD/DVD set that documents their 2008 performance on ""Austin City Limits"". The 13-song tracklist draws heavily from Brighter Than Creation's Dark, but also digs deep into the band's catalog, as far back as their 1998 debut, Gangstabilly. Parallel with their ambitious, sprawling albums, the Truckers have earned a well-deserved reputation as a dependable live act with energy, stamina, and an ever-present bottle of Jack Daniels. ForÂ ""Austin City Limits"", this is a raucous performance, but for the Truckers, it's politely subdued, at times even a bit staid. It's a good show, but they play better shows every night. If their guitars don't churn and ramble as much as they might during a regular club show, this approach puts more emphasis on the band's songwriting, showcasing the uptempo tension of ""The Righteous Path"", which moves almost too fast for Hood to get his lyrics out. That rush heightens the song's desperation palpably, befitting a tale about everyday people struggling from one day to the next. Likewise, Cooley's Southern boogie guitar licks on ""3 Dimes Down"" and closer ""Marry Me"" lose none of their energy in this setting, and ""Space City"", which was lost in the studio sheen of 2006's A Blessing and a Curse, becomes a particularly devastating country lament, especially sung in his distressed baritone. When Hood spits venom on ""Puttin' People on the Moon"", it's hard not to be reminded of the man most closely associated with the Texas Capitol dome on the Austin City Limits backdrop, but none of these Bush-era songs prize the political over the personal. They are character-driven compositions, and Hood has no trouble singing from these perspectives even as he himself comes across as a raconteur on stage. Hood is as compelling setting up these songs as he is singing them, offering lengthy intros to setlist staples ""18 Wheels of Love"" and ""The Living Bubba"" (although he doesn't take as much time and care setting up newer songs). Sure, his prologue to ""18 Wheels of Love"" may be the very same story he told on 1999's live Alabama Ass Whuppin', right down to the words and inflections, but it's become part of the song itself, as crucial as the chorus and verse. Besides, the decade between that album and this one has added a new chapter in the unlikely romance between his mother and stepfather that's so miraculous you might have trouble believing that happy ending. ""You think I make this up?"" he hollers, his voice going raw. ""I could never make this up!"" Alabama Ass Whuppin' looms large over Live From Austin, TX. Released two lineups ago, it captures the band just before Southern Rock Opera, when Rob Malone was still a member and long before Jason Isbell and Shonna Tucker joined. It's the better live album, retaining the band's scouring guitars and gritty punk urgency. The 2005 DVD Live at the 40 Watt is similarly a more representative document of their live shows, benefitting from an excitable hometown audience and the presence of Isbell completing the three-songwriter/four-guitar assault. But the 2009 Truckers are a better band than either the 1999 Truckers or the 2004 Truckers: Hood and Cooley have written some of their best songs this decade, and the additions of bass player Tucker (whose ""I'm Sorry Huston"" shows her to be a strong vocalist and songwriter in her own right) and keyboard player Jay Gonzalez have strengthened their attack considerably. What could have been a simple fans-only release-- essentially redundant at this point in their career-- is instead a strong compliment to what has come before: Live From Austin, TX is a marker in time for a band that seems always to be finding new ways to kick ass.","This CD/DVD set documents what is for the ""ACL"" TV show aÂ raucous performance; for the Truckers, however, it's politely subdued.

A Lovely Sight,Pisces,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4eac0084474cd0c05c2/1:1/w_160/189053dd.jpg,2009-07-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13201-a-lovely-sight/,Numero Group,"Who knows how many mute inglorious psychedelic bands never managed to put out an album? Pisces were one of them: a group from the nowheresville of Rockford, Illinois. Their Lennon and McCartney wannabe auteurs were guitarist Jim Krein and keyboardist Paul DiVenti, who came up through the bar-band scene, put together a little studio and recorded piles of material, basically because they'd heard Sgt. Pepper's and the White Album and had to let it out somehow. Barely any of it was ever heard outside the walls of their studio, A Lovely Sight (which was briefly the band's name, too)-- just three singles on a label run by a Rockford tailor with big ambitions for his own easy-listening sides. This isn't an unreleased album, as such, despite the disingenuous ""bonus tracks"" at the end of the CD: it was pieced together from bits of a half-disintegrated acetate, their singles' A-sides, and a few other tapes that have survived the last four decades. It's not quite a lost masterpiece, either. Pisces weren't a big deal the first time around, partly because they were stuck in the Midwest, but mostly because Krein and DiVenti were strictly average songwriters-- most of their material is somewhere in the range between underdeveloped and barely germinated. The low point is probably ""Elephant Eyes"", an embarrassing Doors impression with a carousel-music bridge flown in from ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" What Pisces did have going for them was a van-load of clever arrangement ideas (like the way the lurching bass riff of ""Dear One"" triggers the song's textural shifts), and mightily impressive studio technique for a couple of guys who were basically doing everything on their own. Every song here has a distinctive and freaky sonic identity that makes a lot out of their limited resources-- they were effectively Elephant 6 avant la lettre. The drum loop that propels ""Mary"" is years ahead of its time (although the flange effect it's run through, along with about half of the rest of the album, is the king of psychedelic clichÃ©s). Accompanied by heady harmonies and a wasp-nest bass riff, it sounds amazing for about 45 seconds; then Krein and DiVenti run out of song and throw in a slowed-down breakdown and a bunch of atonal tape noise and sound effects until it's time for the fadeout. Nice try. Pisces' greatest asset, though, was a singer who was only passing through: 17-year-old Linda Bruner, who sang Krein's lyrics as if she were choking back tears. (Great detail from the liner notes: ""When last heard from, Linda was embroiled in a check fraud scheme and was on the run."") Her voice has the smoldering singularity that Krein's and DiVenti's lack, and she's the star of the album's centerpiece: ""Sam"", a woozy, chorusless, one-chord farewell that was way too much of a bummer to make an impact as a single but staggers out of the album to glower intently at anyone willing to listen to its naked pain. Krein found an ideal interpreter in Bruner, and rose to the opportunity. The four tracks he wrote for her are A Lovely Sight's best and deepest-- effectively an awkward but priceless EP, a little bad-trip marvel. Next to them, the rest of Pisces' surviving output just sounds like context.","Turned on by the Beatles and the Doors, Pisces were a little-known 60s group from Rockford, Illinois, and are now Numero Group's latest excavation.

Azar,Venice Is Sinking,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52cb1335d7bf1698b32/1:1/w_160/b5b5fdbb.jpg,2009-07-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13261-azar/,One Percent Press,"Athens, Ga., quintet Venice Is Sinking emerged in 2006 with what might be best described as a pleasant surprise: debut album Sorry About the Flowers showcased a band with some solid songwriting chops and a brand of earthy chamber pop that was easy to root for. Rather than refine the rough edges of Flowers, however, Venice Is Sinking have charted a different course with Azar, their 2009 follow-up-- though anyone who paid close attention to the intro to ""Undecided"" or stuck around to hear ""Blue by Late"", the 19-minute ambient track that closed Sorry About the Flowers, might have seen this coming. Azar is structured around four electronics-heavy instrumental movements spread across the album, what we might collectively call the ""Azar Suite"". ""Azar One"", with its warm, impressionist tonal swaths eventually given shape by steady march drumming, suggests Explosions in the Sky gone Pure Moods, shot through with just the slightest touch (no pun intended) of Fennesz. ""Two"" takes the main theme into more delicate, twilit territory, and ""Three"" introduces tape manipulation chatter, while ""Four"", which begins as somber undersea waltz as performed on some phantom player piano,Â only turns more gloomily nostalgic with the introduction of strings. Taken together the suite conjures some pretty big, cinematic imagery-- too big, as it turns out, for the still-modest indie pop in between. See, the problem here, and what makes Azar a more satisfying listen in parts than as a whole, is the rather epic disconnect between the ""Azar"" bits and the seven actual songs that comprise the blood and guts of the album. Take ""Young Master Sunshine"" as an example: the track sports an Elephant 6-esque title and comes in a pretty package, with an elegant swaying tempo and a horn- and string-saturated outro reminiscent of Okkervil River, but is ultimately sunk by a chorus-- constructed of slight variations on the line ""It's not enough/ But sometimes it's more than enough""-- too bland and ambiguous to leave much of an impression. It's not for want of trying; while Karolyn Troupe's viola-playing anchored most of the tracks on Sorry, here it's almost an afterthought amid a sound rich with horns, woodwinds, percussion, and atmospheric flourishes. Yet more often than not the grand arrangements tend to smear together rather than punctuate specific moments, and overall these more cautiously optimistic tracks lack the weight of their determinedly melancholy counterparts on Flowers. In short, this is still a small band with some big ideas. Despite its flaws, however, Azar feels like a necessary step for Venice Is Sinking. They're getting their feet wet with some new sounds and departing from the fairly strict structure that kept Flowers engaging but prevented it from ever truly soaring, and one gets the sense that the lessons learned here have the potential to foster some really exceptional material from these guys in the future. And indeed, the band has already cut a third, decidedly less produced album-- recorded live to tape at a local theater subsequently destroyed by fire-- so it's clear they're not just going to fall back on their day jobs for now and hope Azar catches on. They're already trying a new look, and perhaps this will be the one to stick.","Promising Athens, Ga., band continues to expand its sound in intriguing ways, here balancing itsÂ earthy chamber pop with forays into ambient electronics.

Legends of Benin,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4dc5e6ef9596932097b/1:1/w_160/80bfb6f3.jpg,2009-07-15 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13173-legends-of-benin/,Analog Africa,"Analog Africa's Samy Ben Redjeb has spent a lot of time in Benin getting the story of the country's music down, both on paper and on disc. Legends of Benin is his label's third compilation of wicked Beninois groove, and it's easily on par with the first two, one of which was devoted entirely to TP Orchestre Poly-Rythmo, Benin's greatest band. Poly-Rythmo actually make a few appearances as a backing band on this compilation, which is one of uncountable reasons to check it out. The tracklist focuses on four of Benin's greatest, most distinctive bandleaders-- HonorÃ© Avolonto, Antoine DougbÃ©, Gnonnas Pedro, and El Rego-- and each brings something special to the table. Each singer could support a compilation on his own, so getting to hear all four duke it out in the same space is a total blast-- they had decidedly different approaches to floor-burning Afrofunk, but there's not a track here that won't make you want to move. Two of the men featured here preferred to lead their own bands, with musicians they selected. Gnonnas Pedro put together a succession of tight outfits over his career, assembling groups that could throw down a hard funk groove one minute and then turn around and reel off a lilting Afro-Cuban track. El Rego's Commandos often came off a little more rocked-up than their counterparts but could hold their own with just about any kind of beat. Antoine DougbÃ© and HonorÃ© Avolonto tended to bring in the ringers; each spent time with both Poly-Rythmo and sensational trumpeter Ignace de Souza's Black Santiago orchestra. De Souza and Black Santiago (and before Black Santiago, the Melody Aces) were among the first groups in Benin to incorporate Western soul and R&B into their sound in the early 1960s, and they make a perfect backing band for Avolonto on ""Dou DagbÃ© WÃ©"", a burbling Afrobeat track underpinned by a laidback organ figure and head-nodding bass line. He's that much harder with Poly-Rythmo behind him on ""Tin Lin Non"", a sick Fela-influenced Afrofunk workout that shares a lot with what was being recorded next door in Nigeria around the same time in the mid-70s. Yehouessi Leopold uses his drumsticks more to kiss his snare than to smack it, painting behind the needling guitar and staccato bass as the catchy vocal call-and-response works itself into a lather up top. DougbÃ©'s track with Poly-Rythmo, ""Ya Mi Ton Gbo"", has an infectious bounce buoyed by a summery organ, and it reaches an ebulliently joyous high as DougbÃ© calls out to Poly-Rythmo vocalists Vicky and Eskill, who provide spirited backing for DougbÃ©'s rapid-fire vocal. The song is positively weightless, but if that track floats, ""Non Akuenon Hwlin Me Sin Koussio"" practically scours the earth with its heavy reggae thump. The song's completely unexpected modulation after the first couple of verses for a concise instrumental jam is a great example of the kind of detailed, thoughtful composition that makes funk from Benin so constantly rewarding to listen to. Gnonnas Pedro and His Dadjes Band's 1966 cut ""Dadje Von O Von Non"" updates an old rhythm called agbadja, spinning it into a crazily memorable light-speed bed for an earworm of a vocal call-and-response. Pedro was an eclectic bandleader, and that shows even in the small sample heard here. ""La Musica en VeritÃ©"" shows his Afro-Cuban side, combining hints of Cubano son with voodoo rhythms, highlife guitar, and a touch of psychedelic organ to emerge with something all his own. ""Okpo Videa Bassouo"" is more of a crash-and-bash, chicken-scratch funk track with heart-stopping drum fills and stabbing horns. That leaves El Rego, whose ""Feeling You Got"" launched the entire ""jerk"" scene in Benin. Dig the accordion holding down the chord progression as a raw guitar hammers the beat. Ghanaian singer Eddy Black Power, who clearly had some James Brown records, provides the gritty soul-man vocal. ""Vimado Wingnan"" is spiked with a wah'd-out guitar solo, as if the buzzy organ and wild drums (catch the insane break two minutes in) weren't enough to drive it home by themselves. He dials it back for some slow, airy funk on ""E Nan Mian Nuku"". The sequencing of the tracks is well done, moving you from a light bounce to a heavy rhythm and back, playing up the variety without throwing you out of the groove. Mixing the four bandleaders together makes it feel a little like a battle of the bands where everyone won, and it accentuates the contrasts in their styles while allowing for the similarities to show through. Analog Africa is mining serious gold from Benin's funky past, and Legends of Benin is yet more proof that the country had an incredible scene in the 60s and 70s, equal in quality if not quantity to the country's much larger neighbors.","Analog Africa continues its exceptional run of reissues with a compilation that highlights four bandleaders working out of the tiny West African country Benin.

VH1 Storytellers,David Bowie,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ecb1335d7bf1698a9f/1:1/w_160/f3294306.jpg,2009-07-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13202-vh1-storytellers/,VirginEMI,"""Oh you don't know the half of it."" Said in an over-the-top manner, this was David Bowie's inauspicious kick-off to an over-sentimental start to ""Life on Mars"". Like the rest of his 1999 performance on ""VH1's Storytellers"" series, it poses a question, or more accurately, suggests the audience will be privy to inside information. But the answers don't come during a mostly tepid eight-song set. Broadcast in August 1999, a quarter-century after he hung up his Ziggy Stardust kimonos, this episode teased fans with a rare chance to hear the shape-shifting artist discuss and deconstruct part of his mythology. Bowie was running on the fumes of what was a disappointing decade-- between albums like Earthling, Outside, and the then forthcoming Hours...-- but if anybody had an iconic back catalog, a colorful personal narrative (or narratives), and an amazing supporting cast to draw stories from, it was Bowie. Sadly, only flashes of his wit and gregarious storytelling come out during this CD/DVD release of his television performance. Standing at the center of what looks like a bad community theater stage set, entertaining an overly polite audience while donning a gray hoodie, Bowie comes off likable and very off the cuff. Take his introduction to ""China Girl"". After a hushed retelling of a story about a story-- Iggy Pop, over coffee, recalling a 1970s Berlin punk show where German artists built and destroyed a replica of the Berlin Wall-- he says, ""this is a song I wrote with Jim at around that time, and I guess this one's also about invasion and exploitation, take it away, Mike."" There's no mention or insight into Nile Rodgers, the Nazi reference in the song, or the then-controversial, award-winning music video-- just a somewhat interesting little tale followed by a piano intro better suited to some low-budget made-for-TV movie. His storytelling continues in this vein, jumping between the Paul Anka connection to ""Life on Mars"", an Eartha Kitt obsession and the shocking admission that the mid-70s was a dark, drug-fueled period impervious to recall. What's especially frustrating is that he's charming and self-deprecating, tossing out casual references to a meeting with Abbie Hoffmann and doing an amusing Marc Bolan impression, suggesting he could actually tell dozens more interesting, relevant, and revealing stories if he felt like it. Musically, things don't go much better, occasionally sliding into cheesy, cabaret-lite renditions from a band that looks like a casting call for session player stereotypes. Two of the tracks on the original broadcast, along with two more of the bonus tracks on the DVD, come from Hours..., not many fans' first choice. Two of the extra tracks, ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" and ""I Can't Read"", provide a slightly more-well rounded look at his career, but none come with additional commentary, making them four modest live performances, nothing else. It's part of the puzzling DVD/CD element of this release. A DVD with a companion CD that doesn't bother to separate the songs from storytelling or include the bonus tracks makes it an audio recording of a television episode. Don't major labels have enough problems with venerable and archaic media formats without working hard to invent new ones? The substance of this reissue seems indebted to a famous name instead of adding significantly more insight into a famous and intriguing career. It's hard to imagine a fan outcry for a DVD filled with decent to muddled performances.","Based on the storytelling abilities he displays on this CD/DVD set, it's better David Bowie maintain the mystery.

Voltaic,BjÃ¶rk,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52513d1975652138e9c/1:1/w_160/c020c351.jpg,2009-07-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13254-voltaic/,One Little Indian,"Up to this point, the bounty of extracurricular BjÃ¶rk releases-- the live DVDs, remix albums, live LPs, odds'n'sods box sets, surround sound packages-- have all orbited around an astounding centerpiece, whether it be Debut or Post or Homogenic or Vespertine. Such bonus materials were meant to augment the primary artifact and, more often than not, did just that-- even the hilariously excessive Surrounded Dolby 5.1 set came in an irresistible cotton candy-colored square. But VoltaÃ¯c's task is tougher. BjÃ¶rk's latest foray into the deluxe edition world not only has to bolster 2007's Volta, it has to save it. Because even the dude with the Homogenic tattoo on his leg has to admit-- Volta is BjÃ¶rk's worst solo album. In his review of the album, Pitchfork's Mark Pytlik keenly observed that it sounded ""almost unfinished,"" and the heftiness of the VoltaÃ¯c package almost seems to acknowledge this fact. Of the five available versions of the set, the most maxed-out boasts a live DVD chronicling two Volta-era gigs, a DVD stuffed with Volta music videos, a CD of Volta remixes from the likes of Simian Mobile Disco and Ratatat, a Volta-heavy CD recorded at London's Olympic Studio with BjÃ¶rk's Volta tour ensemble, and three LPs that reiterate the tunes on the aforementioned CDs. VoltaÃ¯c isn't a victory lap as much as an attempted rescue mission. The Volta Tour live DVD is the set's centerpiece and offers the best evidence for re-evaluation. Ironically, though, the disc's two shows-- a full-stage extravaganza taped at the Olympia in Paris and a solemn, largely acoustic performance at an Icelandic church-- didn't make me want to give the original Volta another go. Even with frills including BjÃ¶rk's Rainbow Brite-inspired getup, a 10-piece female brass ensemble dressed up like Skittles, and plenty of green lasers, songs like ""Earth Intruders"", ""Vertebrae by Vertebrae"", and ""Wanderlust"" simply can't hope to compete with greatest hits like ""Army of Me"" and ""Bachelorette"". But the DVD does make a great case for what may be BjÃ¶rk's most mysterious and eccentric album, 2004's underappreciated MedÃºlla. Since the singer didn't tour behind that all-vocal curio upon its release, the Volta tour marked the live coming out of several MedÃºlla tracks. Re-arranged for her full band, a mini MedÃºlla suite from the the Paris show proves to be its most unpredictably stunning stretch. ""Where Is the Line"" digs even deeper into its death metal-meets-Gregorian chanting roots, churning with enough gothic evil to satisfy Sunn O))). Then, ""Who Is It"" fulfills the sprightly, weirdo-pop pleasures that Volta promised but didn't deliver. Finally, ""Desired Constellation""-- a static-y electro-ballad that finds BjÃ¶rk ecstatically questioning her own place in the world-- glides like a worthy successor to Homogenic classic ""All Is Full of Love"". Meanwhile, of the five tracks performed at the hushed Reykjavik locale, MedÃºlla's three entries roundly trump the two Volta selections. Modern hymns ""VÃ¶kurÃ³"" and ""Sonnets / Unrealities XI"" take advantage of a full choir to translate a dark knowing seemingly born of another epoch entirely. Volta's understandably forgotten mother-to-son finale, ""My Juvenile"", gets an appropriately warm voice-and-harpsichord treatment and goes lengths to show this 43-year-old pop irregularity looks and sounds noticeably more comfortable in a church than an arena. The rest of VoltaÃ¯c is marred by redundancies. While the remix disc collects an impressive list of producers-- XXXchange, Matthew Herbert, Modeselektor-- almost the whole collection is based on not-completely-radical reworks of the same three songs: ""Earth Intruders"", ""Declare Independence"", and ""Innocence"". Even considering upgrades like XXXchange's admirably funked take on ""Earth Intruders"", the disc becomes wearisome. Kudos to Ratatat, who take on the less obvious-- and not-exactly-danceable-- track ""Wanderlust"" and flip it into something more pop-friendly and fun than anything on Volta proper. Most inconsequentially repetitious, though, is the Live at Olympic Studios disc, recorded by the Volta tour band near the beginning of the trek's 18-month, on-and-off itinerary. Stuck in a purgatory between live album and studio creation, it offers risk-less takes on five Volta tunes, which once again sound staggeringly unmemorable next to stuff like ""Pagan Poetry"" and ""Hunter"". Which brings us to the music videos DVD. To say the videos from Volta were disappointing is an extreme understatement; the album's five clips are not just ""bad for BjÃ¶rk,"" i.e., sub par material from possibly the most original and ambitious video artist this side of Michael Jackson and Madonna. Most of these videos are just inept, full stop. It's almost shocking. But there is a common thread, which may speak to Volta's overall lack of luster. In all of the clips here, BjÃ¶rk's face is obscured or completely computer generated-- from the embarrassingly amateur CGI head of the ""Earth Intruders"" video to her constellation-ized face in ""Dull Flame of Desire"" to the Michel Gondry collaboration ""Declare Independence""-- their least successful vid by miles-- where her head is mostly seen behind a megaphone. This may not matter if BjÃ¶rk didn't have one of the most expressive visages in all of pop; previous eye crushers like ""Big Time Sensuality"", ""Hunter"", and ""Hidden Place"" all rely almost exclusively on the unique contours and twitches of her cheeks, mouth, nose, etc. She even made a straight-up robot appear more than human with the help of video auteur Chris Cunningham in the ""All Is Full of Love"" clip. This second-hand facelessness runs throughout Volta, which still reads oddly rote and cold with this addendum. Even with its hulking abundance, VoltaÃ¯c is flesh without bone.","The latest extracurricular BjÃ¶rk release, this box of live DVDs and CDs, remix CD, and more does more to draw attention to MedÃºlla than toÂ Volta.

The Stars Are Out,Sarah Borges and the Broken Singles,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5725e6ef95969320ad8/1:1/w_160/e133207e.jpg,2009-07-14 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13318-the-stars-are-out/,Sugar Hill,"Punk-spirited honky-tonkerÂ Sarah BorgesÂ is the frustrating sort of artist who displays real songwriting talent yet insists on releasing albums that are half comprised of covers. Not that there's anything wrong with a clearly savvy listener like Borges resurrecting a bunch of once-familiar or never-remembered gems from other artists and interpreting them in her own individual voice and style. But two or three covers per record seems about enough, especially for someone who's already shown she has interesting things to say on her own. Borges' debut featured only four non-originals, yet between her 2007 sophomore releaseÂ Diamonds in the Dark and the newÂ The Stars Are Out, Borges (with her terrifically-named band, the Broken Singles) has released 22 songs, a full 10 of which have previously been recorded by someone else-- almost all of them, it bears mentioning, by someone quite good. One clear testament to the fact that Borges is a pretty damn strong tunesmith is the fact that it's not always readily obvious which of her songs are the covers and which are her own compositions.Â Diamonds in the Dark included material penned by X andÂ Tom WaitsÂ as well as a song popularized byÂ Dolly Parton, yet Borges' own moodily metaphorical ""Modern Trick"" and heartbreaking ""Belle of the Bar"" stood nearly shoulder to shoulder with those selections, while ""The Day We Met"", ""Lonely Town of Love"", and ""Lord Only Knows"" showed her assured command of the bar-rock basics. Unfortunately, the originals onÂ The Stars Are Out aren't always as impressive, and in fact some of the ""is this a cover?"" head-scratching owes more to Borges' imitative sonic and lyrical choices, like the outdated talk of ""party dresses"" on the girl-group-influenced ""Me and Your Ghost"" or the overt fusion of southern rock and bubblegum girl-punk on the opening ""Do It For Free"". Both of these songs are fine for what they are, but do worryingly seem to be the kind of pastiche stuff that normally would represent the high-water mark for a covers-dependent artist. Luckily, we have ""Symphony"" to prove that's not the case with Borges-- it's a lovely, arty song largely devoid of bar-rock influence, marked by pensiveÂ acoustic guitar, soaring violin and a wonderfully affectless vocal turn from its author. And then there are the covers themselves, of course, which I'll admit are admirably inspired in the sheer variety of Borges' source material, and on the whole quite engagingly read. NRBQ's ""It Comes to Me Naturally"" is bar-rock boilerplate, and it's pretty hard to fuck upÂ Smokey RobinsonÂ (Borges doesn't on ""Being with You""), but unearthing the 1980 nugget ""Yesterday's Love"" from Costello soundalikesÂ Any TroubleÂ is certainly laudable, as is digging up theÂ Lemonheads' shaggy ""Ride with Me"" and daring to take on ""No One Will Ever Love You"" from the Magnetic Fields' classicÂ 69 Love Songs. Borges remains a skilled, sensitive interpreter, and because she seems so comfortable in her skin as a keenly sympathetic music buff and sometime songwriter, it's hard to really knock the path she's currently following. Still, I can't help wishing she'd let her own muse have a bit more of the spotlight.","Punk-spirited honky-tonker continues splitting time between writing and covering songs; here, tracks by Smokey Robinson, the Magnetic Fields, NRBQ, and others.

Hustle Beach,Baby Teeth,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52b13d1975652138eab/1:1/w_160/80f889a8.jpg,2009-07-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13259-hustle-beach/,Lujo,"To say that ""Big Schools"", the opening track on Baby Teeth's third album, is both a patience and litmus test is true, but it's also far from the Chicago trio's fault. The song, about meeting a chick at an awesome frat party and more generally about how great it was to go to a college with a monstrous enrollment, is played earnestly and without a whiff of irony, like Robert Pollard with his leg kicks and British affectations, or Brandon Flowers doing whatever Brandon Flowers does. It then becomes a matter of my own taste that I find it so hard to sign off on beer-bongs and cornhole as the source of viable cultural expression, even when it's done well, as it is here. Even more, I realize the irony in that I have no problem with Thin Lizzy's bro-down ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", which Baby Teeth use as the foundation for ""Schools"". Hell, even Steely Dan's ""My Old School"" was at least about a drug bust. Yet the fact that Baby Teeth go full bore on song one into an aesthetic that would no doubt make many Pitchfork readers run for the safety of their Hold Steady LPs makes me respect these dudes. Even better though, graduating from ""Big Schools"" dumped me out into a record that does what few American indie bands are willing to do nowadays: sound like a really good college bar band. These guys clearly grew up listening to classic rock radio and watching MTV, and I'm assuming they're in their early thirties-- if not, then they fake it well-- because integration of the FM era's most outre top 40 stuff, from glam to power pop, bandannaed cock-rock and New Romanticism, shouldn't come this easy, or sound this good. This mix sounds over the top, sure, but it turns out that the best part of Beach is its sense of control-- not to be ""tasteful,"" but just to stop things from flying over the top. Singer Abraham Levitan tempers his occasional histrionics with plenty of restraint, and the band thankfully eschews too much grandiosity in lieu of simple arrangements, sticky melodies, and hooks. ""Shrine""s refrain puts Pollard's melodic swagger over a Fast Times at Ridgemont High bed, and ""The Part You Play"" bends a standard lovelorn lyric into a plaintive, almost soulful wail. Don't front: if the high-gloss danger and spiky synths of ""Hustle Beach"" and the geeky siren wails on ""Snake Eyes"" were made by a group from Paris, or posted on a .rar blog specializing in out of print early-80s New Wave, you'd be all over this. Truth be told, the sociological part of my brain wants to position Baby Teeth as the lower-stakes, Midwestern Vampire Weekend, and my indier-than-thou side wants to assert that Dan Bejar does more inventive things with similar source material, while creating his own mythology to boot. While all of this stuff might be true on some level, none of it, again, has anything to do with the band. Sure, deep down they might think they're pulling one over on the world by sneaking bits of Billy Squier here and there. But who cares, right? It might be hard for some of us, but, especially when the biggest indie song of the year features a protagonist worried about his social status, it's a bit refreshing to hear a band clearly not looking over their shoulders.","Integration of FM-era pop, from glam to power pop, bandannaed cock-rock and New Romanticism, shouldn't come this easy, or sound this good.

Till Makabert VÃ¤sen,Bergraven,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5275e6ef95969320a31/1:1/w_160/4cb5e90e.jpg,2009-07-14 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13256-till-makabert-vasen/,Hydra Head,"For the edge of metal's map, consult Hydra Head Records. The L.A.-via-Boston label started out in New Mexico in the 1990s bending the rules of hardcore punk with bands like Converge, Cave In, Coalesce, and Botch. About five years ago, Hydra Head began taking on metal. Influential acts like Jesu, Khanate, and Xasthur have stretched metal's boundaries. Now metal includes the fuzzy, the broken, and the weak-- characteristics antithetical to traditional metal (precise, constructed, strong). In short, Hydra Head metal is art metal. Purists hate it for abandoning metal culture. In place of the metal uniform (black shirts, blue denim) is an array of pastel colors. Goodbye, spikes and leather; hello, trucker hats. Those who like loud guitars but are scared of metalheads can get with Hydra Head. On one hand, the label's metal is a diluted kind. Few things are as powerful as pure, uncut metal, whether it be death metal, doom metal, black metal, or thrash. These subgenres have had decades to work out ideal formulations. But purity can come from fence-sitting if that is an artist's nature. Sweden's Bergraven, a one-man band by PÃ¤r Gustafsson, is one example. Its debut, 2004's FÃ¶rdÃ¤rv, didn't know whether to be black metal or something else. The record's black metal was serviceable, but stray codas and preludes suggested a predilection for psychedelia. Three years later, follow-up DÃ¶dsvisioner embraced such duality. Bergraven turned into sort of a dark rock act. Elements of black metal, like raspy vocals and raw guitars, remained, but clean tones and bent melodies weaved throughout. Unlike much of black metal, the band had an identity. Till Makabert VÃ¤sen goes further down this path. Now the melodies are elongated and spidery. Their off-kilter dissonance suggests a quieter Deathspell Omega. Slint playing black metal might sound like this. Gustafsson doesn't forget to step on the distortion pedal, though. After wandering through funhouses of skewed high end, songs return to big, rocking riffs. Fellow Swedes Lifelover similarly mate black metal and pop, though they are more tongue-in-cheek. Katatonia on hallucinogens also comes to mind. Some passages suggest Opeth's ornate prog, though much spicier. Pop music often compresses huge worlds into small structures. Bergraven does the opposite. Song start small, then grow tendrils, teeth, and fur. Five minutes later, they're roaring and hissing. Then the shoots and leaves return to the ground. They leave behind an aroma with many notes: black metal, rock, pop, studio weirdness. The smell is unmistakably Bergraven's.","Bergraven's latest continues down a path from black metal to dark rock with clean tones and bent melodies.

...And the Ever Expanding Universe,The Most Serene Republic,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a526ea9e61561daa5084/1:1/w_160/037ccf23.jpg,2009-07-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13255-and-the-ever-expanding-universe/,Arts & Crafts,"Apt title. The Most Serene Republic are, as they always have been, a big band; seven members, expansive arrangements, eyes on the horizon, that sort of thing. They're effective when they sound like a small band, too-- when they manage to wrench as much power out of their tenderest, most threadbare moments as they are when seven people are banging the hell out of their instruments. Though they've had gossamer moments on their two LPs and 2006's fine Phages EP, what they've not yet done is make a record that strikes the right balance between their formidable skills as arrangers and instrumentalists and their penchant for penning affecting, Stars/Mates of State-esque twilight melodrama; you know, retrofitting their little heartbreaks with just the right amount of bombast. Their latest, ...And the Ever Expanding Universe, gets grandiose in nearly all the right places; it's the singing part of the songs that could use a little beefing up. It took them long enough, but these Canadian many-piecers and Arts & Crafts signees finally hooked up with producer of mostly MSR labelmates and Canadian many-piecers Dave Newfeld for Universe. It's Newfeld, so the difference is clear; surely I can't be the first to liken his work behind the boards to bobbing up and down in mildly troubled waters on an otherwise beautiful afternoon, but whatever the description, if you've listened to much indie rock in the past five years or so, you know it well. Newfeld helps MSR suss out some of their tendencies towards overcrowding and lends the quieter moments a lovely glow, but as with most Newfeld productions, there aren't many moments where you can't hear the guy conducting; one can't help but wonder if he's instructing guitarists to strum everything in that dun-dun-d-dun ""Almost Crimes"" rhythm. I mention all this not to belittle the band's role in its own record, but to reemphasize: ...And the Ever Expanding Universe is a truly gorgeous sounding album, and while that's certainly got plenty to do with Newfeld, it's no less impressive for it. Arrangements pop where before they might simply pile it on, and songs rise and fall with requisite grace. The formula of 2007's overworked Population hasn't changed significantly, it's just been, er, expanded upon; it's roughly the equivalent of seeing a movie you've grown up with on TV on a big screen for the first time, and everything's just a bit brighter and given a lot more room to walk around. I'd argue, too, that Adam Moerder's closing complaint in his review of Population was met about halfway here: melody lines do bob and weave-- there's plenty of diversity between the relatively straight-up strum-pop of ""Heavens to Purgatory"" to the synth throb of ""Don't Hold Back, Feel a Little Longer"" and lightly orchestrated ""Patternicity"" to answer that charge-- but when you remove the window dressing, the songs still seem a little shabby. But this is, after all, a big band, and you've got to give all those idle hands something to do. Besides,Â those instrumental passages are the songs as much as anything with a fuckton of flutes on a Sufjan record is. I suppose the trouble lies in the fact that the most memorable parts of Universe, just as with the band's past work, tend to be the instrumental flourishes rather than the singing-- a weird thing for a vocal pop record. It's a manifold problem: Adrian Jewett affects a near-brogue when he sings so even his most assured vocal lines feel a bit swallowed, Emma Ditchburn's got kind of a wispy Isobel Campbell thing going on, which doesn't really fly in a mix this busy, and when the two double up (as they so often do), it's all those things at once. Indeed, there's a couple of impressive vocal turnarounds in opener ""Bubble Reputation"" and ""Heavens to Purgatory""; bless their hearts for singing ""gadzooks gadzooks gadzooks!"" on that one with reasonably straight faces. But even the most straightahead track here, the slightly Jock Jammy ""Don't Hold Back, Feel a Little Longer"" is more compelling in its clatter than its crooning. Structurally and, gadzooks aside, lyrically, the non-orchestrated are fine; it's just that a sound this expansive needs more swagger behind the mic, lest the tunes get lost in the fray yet again. At least this time out, losing yourself in the fray's not a bad way to go.","Arts & Crafts band hooks up with frequent A&C production wizard Dave Newfeld (BSS), who helps give its work more polish and beauty.

Ill Communication [Deluxe Edition],Beastie Boys,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a530ea9e61561daa5097/1:1/w_160/bd714efe.jpg,2009-07-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13319-ill-communication-deluxe-edition/,CapitolCapitol,"By 1994, the Beastie Boys were a lot closer to 30 than they were to 20, and it's not much of a stretch to interpret their fourth album as a growing-up phase of sorts. Where Check Your Head was a jam session turned venting process turned crossover success, Ill Communication is the album that let them infuse their turn towards sincerity with a renewed sense of playfulness, solidifying their transition from the gleefully exaggerated bad-boy anarchists of their first two albums to a trio of (slightly) more mature, trend-setting enthusiasts. It's as if they took stock in their history, realized they were past the point of having to prove anything, said what the hell, and decided to throw their whole repertoire into the album. Considering the record was assembled over a comparatively brief six-month span, it's an ideal, condensed snapshot of the Boys' genuine interests and cultural obsessions, whether they were spiritual (Buddhism), musical (late-60s/early-70s soul-jazz) or recreational (no less than three members of the 1993-94 Knicks get shout-outs). It's the Beasties at their most lifestyle-savvy, though they came across less like opportunistic youth marketers and more like the idiosyncratic hipsters they'd always been. (Remember, this was in 1994, before ""hipster"" was a pejorative.) Their lyrical personalities are a bit more distinct, too, even as they keep up their traditional mic-passing back-and-forth rapport: MCA's the pistol-smashing, anti-misogynist, spiritual one, who gets a couple of solo joints to mull over the decaying state of the world (""The Update"") and espouse upon his Buddhism (""Bodhisattva Vow""). Mike D's the instigator of analog throwbacks (""I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD""), working-class style (""I'm shopping at Sears 'cause I don't buy at the Gap"") and b-boy golf chic (""Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot/ Then you throw me off the green 'cause I'm strictly hip-hop""). And Ad-Rock's the irreverent name-dropper who compares himself to everyone from underground cartoonist Vaughn Bode to Moog pioneer Dick Hyman in the process of big-upping his microphone technique. But even amidst all the Gen-X cool-hunting and social-conscience soul-searching the Beasties were undertaking at the time, Ill Communication rings true because it stands as one of their most dedicated engagements with hip-hop culture. They're game as far as actual lyricism goes; even if they're a half-step behind the dizzying, rapid-fire linguistic free-for-all of Paul's Boutique, there's enough quotables and inspired moments of limber beat-riding in tracks like ""Sure Shot"", ""Root Down"", and ""Do It"" to hold up. It helps the cause that the Caldato-abetted beats have a close affinity with the classic post-Premier/Pete Rock early-90s NYC production sound, to the extent that it sounds a bit like the work of a Native Tongues auxiliary-- and not just because of Q-Tip's great, off-the-cuff-sounding guest spot on ""Get It Together"". It's an influence the Beasties wear on their sleeves, focusing ""Root Down"" around the reverently-acknowledged 1972 Jimmy Smith jazz-funk classic of the same name, infusing cuts like ""Alright Hear This"" and ""Flute Loop"" with Village Vanguard atmosphere, and throwing around a cratedigger's shopping list of names-- Les McCann, Yusef Lateef, Archie Shepp, Bernard ""Pretty"" Purdie-- in ""Alright Hear This"". Throw those moments alongside anything off Buhloone Mindstate or Midnight Marauders and they stand up strong, plus you've got yourself a hell of a pool party mixtape. A whole album full of that caliber of straight-up hip-hop would've been a pretty safe bet for borderline-classic status, but the fact that Ill Communication frequently switches between that and their more sprawling live-band stuff actually adds to its kitchen-sink charm a bit-- largely because so much of it's cut from a similar cloth as the soul-jazz records they sampled for their lyrical cuts. Sure, the big axe-swinging titan at the center of this album is the fuck-yeah highlight ""Sabotage"", the meatiest slab of moshpit rap-rock aggression the Beasties ever put to tape, and it stomps around a bit conspicuously between the funk-bop grooves of ""Root Down"" and ""Get It Together"". It's a classic case of the album's biggest single being its least-representative track, though I ain't complaining about its inclusion in the least; I think the one time I listened to that song and didn't get all amped, I was in a bronchitis-fighting NyQuil stupor. But the instrumentals that they'd started experimenting with on Check Your Head are a bit more at home here, and they benefit from some additional polish and a tighter structure. The growly, early-Funkadelic-meets-El Chicano doom-funk jam ""Futterman's Rule"", the violin-driven shtetl-dub of ""Eugene's Lament"" and Money Mark's sleek electric piano vibe-out showcases ""Ricky's Theme"" and ""Transitions"" reveal a band that's busted their asses in the process of honing a relatively new aspect of their craft. They also wisely relegate their hardcore tendencies to the realm of absurd intermission-caliber comedy tracks; they might not be the most indispensable songs, but there's something inherently hilarious about using Minor Threat aesthetics to rail against a ""Bill Laimbeer motherfucker"" pickup-game nemesis. Like Check Your Head, this reissue of Ill Communication comes with a bonus disc of B-sides and remixes; unlike Check Your Head, the B-sides and remixes are mostly good-to-great, though a bit redundant if you already own 1995's Root Down EP and/or are uninterested in listening to 87 seconds of the Beasties playing basketball. Still, it's worth it to hear the Prunes' Free Zone Mix of ""Root Down"" and the live performance of ""The Maestro"" where Ad-Rock goes fantastically apeshit on the ""yeah, you motherfuckers, I'm all that"" bit. In any case, the best thing about this reissue is that it's a good excuse to reassess an album that isn't quite as derivative and tossed-off as you might remember. Since it shared some of their previous album's stylistic tendencies, a few listeners were left trying to pinpoint where the groove ended and the rut began when the album first came out. It's still regarded in some circles as a water-treading attempt to continue drawing off the aggro-punk/garage-funk blueprint of Check Your Head, and lord knows I'll probably draw some what-the-fucks for opining that Ill Communication's actually a fair bit better. But once the Beasties got a steady grip on their live-band sound, the fact that they found a way to reincorporate the gleefully adolescent goofiness of Licensed to Ill and the retro-funk style and pop-culture obsessions of Paul's Boutique is what really let them put together their ideal here-to-stay mission statement.","The Beastie Boys' expanded reissue campaign rolls on.

Over and Over,The Legends,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d9ea9e61561daa4fe3/1:1/w_160/262de2c6.jpg,2009-07-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13176-over-and-over/,Labrador,"As secretive Swedish songwriter Johan AngergÃ¥rd has shown, the upside of fronting a band that doesn't actually exist is that you can make it do whatever you want or don't want it to do, without having to nurse the guitarist's ego or endure the new song your drummer's just written. Over the course of three albums, AngergÃ¥rd's faux-band concept the Legends has been variously re-imagined as 1980s-vintage indie aesthetes (2004's Up Against the Legends), dreary post-punk miserablists (2005's Public Radio) and discotheque-courting synth-popsters (2006's Facts and Figures). But, at the same time, the Legends haven't really changed at all. At the core of almost every single song is AngergÃ¥rd's crestfallen voice, so consistent in its ability to convey longing and so unwavering in its forlorn tenor, you'd swear it was some computer preset. Listening to the Legends' discography, one doesn't so much get the sense of an artist undergoing some gradual album-to-album evolution, but rather one that tries on and sheds stylistic dressing like paper-doll outfits. On Over and Over, this process is more arbitrary than ever, marking both a return to the live-band, fuzz-pop feel of the Legends' beloved first album and further deviations away from it: the album opens with an uncharacteristically melodramatic mope-rock anthem (""You Won"", which suggests Oasis if they were more in thrall to early-80s Cure than the Beatles) before touching on breezy bongo folk (""Jump""), middle-gear motorik krautrock (""Something Strange Will Happen""), and-- when all else fails-- Psychocandied pop squall. Unfortunately for the Legends, this return to their formative mid-80s Creation Records influences arrives at a time when those same sources have been recently and thoroughly milked by The Pains of Being Crystal Stilts, and some tracks (""Always the Same"", ""Recife"") can't help but sound like standard-issue riffs on the typical noise/pop dichotomy. But there are instances where all that unrelenting feedback plays more than a simply decorative/desecrating role: on ""Seconds Away"" and the beautifully brooding title track, the white-noise wash proves to be an uncanny complement for AngergÃ¥rd's emotionally numb vocals, like ghosts communicating through TV static; on the ecstatic garage-rock rush of ""Dancefloor"", AngergÃ¥rd's high-note vocals distort to the point of sounding Auto-Tuned, blurring the line between primal performance and studio science. But if Over and Over encourages the Legends' noisiest impulses, it also tempers the dissonance to showcase some of AngergÃ¥rd's most winsome songwriting since Up Against the Legends: ""Monday to Saturday"" is a snap-along, C86-eriffic he-said/she-said duet, and ""Heartbeats"" presents its confessions of pill-popping binges and panic attacks in the form of a shimmering, synth-swathed slow dance. With its abundance of obtrusive distortion and shuffle-mode stylistic shifts, Over and Over renders AngergÃ¥rd's as enigmatic and inscrutable a figure as ever. But after two albums that were overly reliant on precise, clinical aesthetics, the rough-edged randomness of Over and Over makes the Legends a myth worth believing in again.","The shapeshifting project of Sweden's Johan AngergÃ¥rd (Club 8, Acid House Kings) returns to the live-band, fuzz-pop feel of its beloved first album.

Bandages for the Heart,Lacrosse,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d2ea9e61561daa4fd2/1:1/w_160/350bb0d7.jpg,2009-07-13 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13182-bandages-for-the-heart/,Tapete,"You wouldn't need to pay attention to the lyrics on Lacrosse's sophomore album to understand that every track is about love. Not just any love, mind you-- a big, big love; the sort of gigantic feeling that threatens to distract you from everything else in your life. The music is enormous and often overwhelming, with every hook and gesture blown out to absurd extremes of joy, desire, and anxiety, emulating the heightened emotional reality of romantic comedies and teen soaps. Every moment of the album sounds incredibly exaggerated, but at their best, Lacrosse replicate the intense drama of ordinary love with uncanny accuracy. There are many ways to sound huge on record, so let's clarify: Lacrosse's approach to pop music falls at the intersection of the Arcade Fire's propulsive life-or-death anthems and Alphabeat's hyper-romantic glee, resulting in an odd but immensely appealing hybrid sound that is perhaps best described as stadium twee. The lyrical concerns and general aesthetic of the band is essentially the same as what you may expect from, say, any band on the Darla label, but the music is far more muscular and ambitious, trading in the demure self-deprecation of homegrown indie for the forthright emoting of full-blown chart pop. Every track on Bandages for the Heart is a male/female duet, with singers Nina WÃ¤hÃ¤ and Kristian Dahl mostly singing in unison to add punch to their otherwise thin voices. The immediate effect of their overlapping voices is to exacerbate the urgency of the music, but in the context of their lyrics, the technique mostly serves to highlight the fact that every song is about the communication between two people. WÃ¤hÃ¤ and Dahl can be quite thrilling when they sing together, but they are even better when they split into constrasting parallel parts that offer differing perspectives on the same theme. This approach is especially effective in ""I See a Brightness"", an uplifting rocker about one half of a couple attempting to bring the other around to a more optimistic point of view. Though many other bands can write peppy, catchy songs with anthemic choruses, Lacrosse are exceptionally gifted in dramaticizing the nuances of human relationships, and this anchors their bombast to relatable experiences rather than vague, fluffy sentiment. The characters on the record may be in different states of romantic angst, but each comes off as a real person in a specific situation, and the lyrics skillfully tip prosaic expressions of excitement, lust, and anxiety into witty asides. The lyrics are even better when they attain a level of lucidity nearly at odds with the hysterical emotion suggested by the music, as in the ebullient ""Come Back Song #1"", or the freakishly giddy ""It's Always Sunday Around Here"". Lacrosse's aggressively perky tunes about love are exceedingly well-executed, but they tend to only be endearing if you are in the right state of mind. At the wrong moments, even the most glorious and life-affirming songs on Bandages for the Heart can be overbearing and flat-out aggravating, particularly if the very last thing you want to think about are the romantic entanglements of relentlessly grinning Swedes. Of course, only the blandest music can serve all purposes. When heard in moderation, or better yet, when in perfect allignment with its sentiment, these are some of the boldest, most evocative pop tunes you are likely to hear this year.","Throughout this LP of love songs, every moment sounds exaggerated, but at their best, Lacrosse replicate the drama of ordinary love with uncanny accuracy.

Music From the North Country: The Jayhawks Anthology,The Jayhawks,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a528ea9e61561daa5088/1:1/w_160/8f0b4ce5.jpg,2009-07-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13257-music-from-the-north-country-the-jayhawks-anthology/,Legacy,"Despite recording one of the foundingÂ alt-countryÂ documents, the Jayhawks never really sounded especially country or punk-- not in the early 1990s and certainly not in the late 2000s. Instead, the Minneapolis band gravitated toward dusty iterations of classic rock-- more Tom Petty than Gram Parsons or the Minutemen. What distinguished them-- and what qualified them for membership in the alt-country club-- was the vocals: Gary Louris and Mark Olson sang like they were born joined at the throat, alternating between tight harmonies and unisons in the style of such old-time country duos as the Louvin Brothers, whom they have covered repeatedly throughout their quarter-century career. Music From the North Country is the Jayhawks' first retrospective of any kind, which seems odd for a band so closely associated with such a prominent trend, but the band itself has been in disarray for half a decade now as its members focus more on solo and duo albums. In fact, this release seems geared more toward Louris and Olson's recent joint tours than toward the band's reunion gigs in Barcelona and Minneapolis. Music from the North Country traces their story from their beginnings as a struggling local act to their final chapter as a struggling national act. Arguing persuasively for the Jayhawks as great vocalists, decent style synthesists, and thwarted careerists, this candid compilation doesn't overlook mistakes or strain for happy endings. It's fitting, then, that the retrospective opens with ""Two Angels""-- not the more well-known Hollywood Town Hall version, but the rawer recording from Blue Earth, whose forlorn harmonica and roomy vocal reverb make it not only an ideal introduction but a good point to measure just how much or how little their sound expanded in 15 years. The songs from Blue Earth, Hollywood Town Hall, and 1995's Tomorrow the Green Grass show the band at the top of their game, making the drama of ""Take Me With You (When You Go)"", the narrative specifics of ""Clouds"", and eloquent arrangement of ""I'd Run Away"" sound easy and natural. Shortly after the release of Grass, Olson left the band to make a series of inconsequential albums with then-wife Victoria Williams (of the overrated ""Miss Williams' Guitar""), robbing the band of its most distinctive characteristic and leaving Louris to soldier on as frontman. The biggest surprise on Music From the North Country is how well the tracks from the Jayhawks' first Olson-less album hold up. Trading their classic-rock harmonies for dark pop influences*, Sound of Lies* chronicled their own career inertia, and while Louris can sound self-absorbed, he can also be brutal in his self-assessment, calling himself ""a has-been at a mere thirty-five"" on ""Big Star"". Yes, it's named after the Memphis band, and yes, it romanticizes their obscurity, yet that song and ""The Man Who Loved Life"" are hearty rock anthems for any musician with more dreams than fans. The commercial and critical failure of Sound of Lies was a self-fulfilling prophecy, which is unfortunate since it's also the last time the Jayhawks sounded so compellingly hungry. After ""The Man Who Loved Life"", Music From the North Country falters and never recovers: The tracks from their 2000 album Smile are busy with bells and whistles, as if desperate to convince listeners of their songs' importance, and those from 2003's possible swan song Rainy Day Music have some nice moments-- the streamlined tempo of ""Tailspin"", the empathetic chorus of ""Angelyne""-- but in general, the band sound too comfortable, as if cowed by their diminishing horizons into making a safe album. That's the official story, ending not with a bang but with a series of whimpers, and as such, Music From the North Country seems less interested in prompting nostalgia in long-time fans than in telling newcomers told-you-so. But the deluxe edition of this retrospective provides a parallel history that is just as compelling, if not necessarily as accessible. In addition to a DVD of videos and promo clips (including a cameo by ""Weeds"" star Mary-Louise Parker), it features a second disc of rarities, covers, live cuts, and demos, starting with their self-titled debut and ending with rough takes of Rainy Day Music tracks. Opener ""Falling Star"" and Hollywood-era ""Stone Cold Mess"" make the country elements of their sound much more explicit, while Fred Neil and J.D. Loudermilk covers suggest the breadth of styles they processed. This disc contains alternate versions of some of their most popular songs, some of which improved from demo to studio (""Old Woman from Red Clay"" now sounds like a strange karaoke version of ""Two Angels"") and others that suffered during the same process (""Someone Will"" has a sharper lyrical sting than the vaguely creepy ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me""). Presenting so many what-if scenarios, this disc tracks a very different career arc in which the Jayhawks never get as famous as they might have expected but never seem to care.","Oddly, this is theÂ first retrospective of any kind for the Jayhawks,Â one of the founding and key alt-country bands of the 1990s.

Drums of Passion,Babatunde Olatunji,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5295e6ef95969320a38/1:1/w_160/c605679a.jpg,2009-07-13 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13258-drums-of-passion/,SonySony,"Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji enjoyed a rich musical legacy during his lifetime. He is credited as being one of the first musicians to bring genuine African music to Western ears en masse, having burst on the scene in 1959 with his debut, Drums of Passion. It was the first known album of traditional West African drumming and chants to be recorded in the United States (Olatunji moved to Atlanta in 1950 before relocating permanently to New York City), and was released during a high tide of political and cultural change-- including appearing alongside epochal jazz recordings by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, and Ornette Coleman. As listeners were exposed to different styles and the collective interest in world music and jazz continued to grow in popularity, Olatunji helped turn people's attention away from the corny melodies that dominated the exotica genre fad by offering authentic, captivating songs from his native homeland. Six years after Olatunji's death at age 75, and 50 years after its original release, Drums of Passion has received the deluxe treatment as a beautifully packaged 2xCD containing its companion album More Drums of Passion (1966) and a well-chosen smattering of jazz-influenced bonus tracks, some of which were previously unreleased in the U.S. It also benefits from considerate remastering: the sound snaps with color, defining the rhythmic fabric with greater clarity while illuminating the integrity and magnetic intensity of Olatunji's arrangements. In some ways, the impact of this sonic resuscitation feels even more vital on a recording that is structured primarily by multiple tiers of voice and percussion, as the distinction between them were often tricky to capture, particularly in studios with comparatively limited equipment. Olatunji frequently drafted a vivacious, disparate ensemble of musicians and vocalists to contribute to his recordings, and many of these people drifted in and out of the studio unknown and unaccredited. By its very nature, his music is designed to be performed by large groups-- it is this communal input that gives Drums of Passion its infectious vitality and relentlessly entertaining energy. The elated female and male chants on ""Odun De! Odun De! (Happy New Year)"" glide over a knot of polyrhythms, while the call and response vocals on ""Baba Jinde (Flirtation Dance)"" are injected with so many whoops and jeers that the song ends up sounding like a pack of copulating hyenas, pinned down by a surge of ecstatic Afro-Cuban rhythms. ""The spirit of the drum is something that you feel but cannot put your hands on,"" Olatunji once explained to an interviewer. ""It does something to you from the inside out. It hits people in so many different ways, but the feeling is one that is satisfying and joyful."" This zeal lay at the root of Olatunji's music, and is arguably felt more ferociously on Drums of Passion than any other of his many recordings. It may not be as immediately accessible as some of his later work, but in terms of improvisational liveliness and the sheer animation of his rhythmic phrasing and arrangements, itâs hard to beat. Over the last several decades, fans of world music have had access to a plethora of material from all over the globe. But it's worth retracing the steps to this virtuoso, who not only brought genuine West African music to popular attention but also influenced musicians such as Quincy Jones, the Grateful Dead, and Bob Dylan. Olatunji was a remarkable entertainer, whose impression on world music is as enjoyable and significant now as it was in the early 1960s. He has achieved a gold standard in music: Timelessness, and an ardor that does not simply simmer but glows fiercely, and joyfully, from within.","Nigerian drummer's highly influential 1959 debut is remastered and packaged with its 1966 companion piece and well-chosen extras on this 2xCD reissue.

Horehound,The Dead Weather,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4cab1335d7bf1698a47/1:1/w_160/09ddbc41.jpg,2009-07-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13187-horehound/,Third Man,"Pretty much every city in North America has an FM radio station boasting a slogan along the lines of ""Where Classic Rock Lives!"" But really, these are the places where classic rock goes to die, fossilized onto playlists that haven't been updated since the second Black Crowes album. You think it's hard getting attention for your psych-folk-disco-shitgaze collective? Try being an up-and-coming meat-and-potatoes blues-rock band, who are shut out from both hipster-blog discourse and the sort of mainstream media channels that theoretically should be nurturing them. Most people laughed at the Blueshammer scene in Ghost World; me, I just felt sorry for those dudes-- because once they leave that bar, there's really nowhere else for them to go. The plight of the post-millennial blues-rocker thus makes Jack White's ascent to superstardom all the more remarkable, having refashioned such dead-horse devices as slide-geetar riffs and Bonham-style boogies into something both exciting and exceedingly profitable. And he's done it by not just honoring the blues' authenticity, but exploiting the music's capacity for mythology, using it to color his world any way he sees fit, be it the candy-striped fantasyland of the White Stripes, or the wood-panelled, Dazed and Confused-style nostalgia trip of the Raconteurs. And it's the reason he's been able to extend his golden touch to now a third band, the Dead Weather, who delve even deeper into the blues' swampy roots and devil's-music deviancy, but in a manner that's every bit as stylized, sexually charged, and trashy as an episode of ""True Blood"". Of course, the major difference this time out is that White's dropped the guitar and returned to his first instrument, the drums. But the rear-admiral position hardly diminishes his presence; arguably, it gives him an even better vantage point to direct his cast, which includes Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence, Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist/guitarist Dean Fertita, and, in the starring role, Alison Mosshart of the Kills. Even though the Dead Weather is unquestionably a full-band effort, Horehound is designed as a showcase for its lead vocalist as much as the White-produced Van Lear Rose was for Loretta Lynn-- Mosshart's face is front and center on the album cover, and after the cool electro-pop maneuvers of the Kills' Midnight Boom, her cat-in-heat performances on Horehound suggest an eagerness to bust out of that band's minimalist, drum-machined parameters, and give the sort of scrappy, scuzz-rock songs that defined the Kills' early releases a full-blooded treatment. But while built from the same rudiments as its principals' other bands, the Dead Weather are greatly distinguished by a richness of atmosphere. Over its 11 tracks, Horehound rarely relents in its murky, humid, southern-gothic ambience-- one that's greatly thickened by Fertita's Dr. John-style organ mojo and Lawrence's array of fuzz-bass effects. And if both the White Stripes and the Raconteurs have traditionally positioned their singles in the album-opener slots, the Dead Weather take their sweet time to settle into the deep marshland miasma of ""60 Feet Tall""; taking a page from PJ Harvey's size-queen routine, Mosshart belts out the title as a badge of invincibility while the song ebbs and flows between solitary blues-picking and eruptions of blast-furnace noise. On top of setting up Horehound's greyscale scenery, ""60 Feet Tall"" also establishes White's drumming style for the album-- simple and steady-as-she-goes, favoring tension-building snare-rim rolls and strategically placed cymbal taps, with echoplexed accents to expand the sense of space. Or, in the case of the less-than-incendiary (and not entirely representative) single ""Hang You From the Heavens"" or its sluggish sister track, ""No Hassle Night"", he'll trip up the rhythm in an attempt to make a repetitive blues-rocker sound more dynamic. But even when perched behind the kit, White's not one to turn down a duet with fetching female foil, and Horehound really shows its teeth when he and Mosshart battle for mic control. Thankfully they do often, blurring their voices on the gender-bending reggaeified funk strut ""I Cut Like a Buffalo""; playing call-and-response on a deliciously sleazy Led Zepped take on Bob Dylan's ""New Pony"" and the Bad Seedy chain-gang chant ""So Far From Your Weapon""; and, literally, playing tug of war for control of the Royal-monster-Trux groover ""Treat Me Like Your Mother"", which in Mosshart's hands sounds like less a plea for respect than an Oedipal enticement. Even *Horehound'*s most reverential blues gesture-- the strung-out acoustic reverie ""Will There Be Enough Water""-- retains the album's haunted vibe, with a completely spent White and Mosshart begging for a few life-saving drops that they know will never come. The songs on Horehound don't so much rock as writhe, reinstituting the idea of the blues as a sinister, morally corrupting force that's as much the province of voodoo priests and witch doctors as musicians. Perhaps Jack White's continued dominance over contemporary blues-rock is in fact the product of some deal with the devil-- and if that means more bands as fully realized as the Dead Weather, let's hope that Beelzebub will consider a contract renewal.","Jack White teams with Alison Mosshart (the Kills) and members of QOTSA and his Raconteurs on this project, whichÂ delves deep into swampy blues rock.

Moondagger,Deastro,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49ac0084474cd0c0514/1:1/w_160/9e77181e.jpg,2009-07-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13315-moondagger/,Ghostly,"Deastro is a project led by Randolph Chabot, an ambitious young guy from Detroit for whom no mode of expression would seem to be wholly sufficient-- in terms of scalability or just sheer size. Everything he does is dramatic and huge: every synth sweep, every guitar charge, every utterance about something either big and momentous or small and more significant than most of us, simply moving through a day, might stop to notice. Chabot also has a good grasp on all the things that conspire to make up pop hooks, which helps. A lot. It helps keep his heaviness light, and it helps make Deastro all the more endearing when the weight of Chabot's ambition wobbles out of sorts. Deastro began when Chabot was a teenager-- with hundreds of songs written by the time he was 17, according to a biography that also includes mention of a ""space symphony"" visited upon him in a fit of prayer. Then last year came a more earthly offering: a gathering of songs released as part of the fruitful digital-download program eMusic Selects. Somewhere in that duality lurk signs of Deastro as a whole: an easy mingling of cracked divination with a manically prolific, savvily web-wise work ethic. The eMusic album, Keeper's, cast Deastro as a one-man synth-pop band given to vast Technicolor soundscapes with mouthy melodies and grand emotive gestures. It's the kind of homemade music in which no one good idea goes without 10 sub-ideas to attend it-- and expand it, usually, to charming effect. For Moondagger, the official debut for Ghostly International, Chabot built up a fuller rock band and aimed even bigger-- for better and worse. It's less than a minute into the first song, ""Biophelia"", that Moondagger reaches a dramatic crest, with a crash of drums and an explosion of guitar that play like parts of an imagined anthem. ""There are no clever words/ There is no poetry/ It's how I feel,"" Chabot sings, with a ton of moody passion. As Moondagger unfolds, he proves wrong on the first two counts and right on the last one. As a songwriter, Chabot comes off like a curious mix of Jeff Mangum and Depeche Mode. He sings of ""dreams of dogs with two faces"" in ""Biophelia"" and feverish rushes of gothy brood-bait in songs with titles like ""The Shaded Forests"" and ""Toxic Crusaders."" In the last, Chabot shows off a giddily ecstatic, defiantly hopeful side that proves more prevalent than his dour one: ""Our culture says we were born like this / With mutant genes and no will to give/ But even the darkest sin has the taste of regret/ We can't be all that bad if we wish were different."" All this over tracks that positively overflow with sound, from billowing synth builds Ã¡ la M83 to little churning whirligig guitar notes that spin out melodic hooks with all the surety of Phoenix. It's accomplished and impressive always, but sometimes to the point of verging on an overstuffed din-- the aural equivalent of occasionally strained lyrics like ""Egyptian ruins are a mystery mansion full of new mystic scansions and matriarchal advancements"" (those from ""Greens, Grays, and Nordics""). The drums and the bass parts of the full-band Deastro-- not to mention the what sound like literally dozens of layers of synths-- can come off as cluttered. And the seams that seeded the sense of Chabot as a labor-happy home-producer on his more demo-like songs get ironed out in production that favors the big over the endearing. But rousing highlights like ""Kurgan Wave Number One"" and the aforementioned ""Greens, Grays, and Nordics"" (a four-minute epic that actually earns and makes sense of those ""Egyptian ruins"" lyrics) play like the anthems they were conceived to be. And Chabot seems to know his place, with perspective, in the end. In a song whose long title threatens to drown out any lyrics within it, he sings, ""I'm small, but I'm important still."" He sounds like he's singing to himself while also managing a dramatically inclusive personality he couldn't turn down if he tried. (That song title, incidentally: ""Daniel Johnston Was Stabbed in the Heart with the Moondagger by the King of Darkness and his Ghost is Writing This Song as a Warning to All of Us."") That's all of us, to be sure.","Prolific bedroom auteur Randolph Chabot hires a backing band and finally releases his long-awaited Ghostly International debut.

Waxing Gibbous,Malcolm Middleton,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56db1335d7bf1698bc9/1:1/w_160/5f10fb74.jpg,2009-07-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13313-waxing-gibbous/,Full Time Hobby,"Sloppy reading led me to wonderÂ  (for longer than I should admit) why Malcolm Middleton would name his fifth solo album for ape hair-removal. The former Arab Strap multi-instrumentalist is known for his black, oddball sense of humor-- his 2007 Christmas single was called ""We're All Going to Die""-- but figuring out how a bald gibbon would play into the personal themes of his songwriting was both intriguing and maddening. Luckily (or sadly, depending on your point of view) the collection is actually called Waxing Gibbous, a phrase that refers to a more-than-half-full phase of the moon and has nothing at all to do with zoo animals. For Middleton it is a sly nod to his critics who have long labeled him a downer of the Morrisseynian variety. ""Look,"" he seems to be saying, ""my glass is half full!"" And thus he begins the record, which he has threatened will be his last for some time, with a track so florid and anthemic that you have to wonder if the former folky Scottish sourpuss has been on an all-Bruce Springsteen listening diet. ""Red Travellin' Socks"" is not just the album opener, but also a five-minute thesis statement of sorts. It finds Middleton stretching his legs beyond the morose finger-picked acoustic guitars and deadpan delivery that has become his trademark. He experiments with jaunty rhythms and a bombastic (by his standards) arrangement that includes vocals shared with longtime collaborator Jenny Reeve that are some of the most melodic of his career. Though the song starts out as your typical homesick-musician-on-the-road lament (""I've left my girlfriend alone for too long/ I need to get back where I belong/ Take me home""), it digs deeper, exploring why the journeyman journeys to begin with. So, as the rolling E Street Band pianos (courtesy of Mogwai's Barry Burns) slow and the rest of the instruments recede into the background, Middleton sheepishly croons, ""It's time to dig out my traveling socks/ The walls are shrinking and I think I've got itchy feet/ And you're needing your space/You're starting to look like you're sick of my face/ Take me away."" Listeners often mistake such unblinking honesty as miserablism, but much like Morrissey, Middleton uses self-deprecation as self-expression. There's buoyancy to his bleakness and a wit present in even his most depressive tracks that gives his songs spark. So even if listeners want to use his songs as sad-sack soundtracks, they were clearly not intended as such. That said, most of tracks on Gibbous don't follow in ""Red Travellin' Socks""' lively footsteps, and that is probably for the best. Though the rollicking rhythms of ""Kiss at the Station"" and jaunty backing vocals of ""Shadows"" are infectious, I still prefer my Middleton slightly dry in delivery and slow and hushed in dynamic. ""Ballad of Fuck All"" is, therefore, the standout, a track that is reduced to just churchy ""oh""s, rolling acoustic arpeggios and Middleton's unadorned voice. It feels like a Leonard Cohen ballad: torchy, sad, intensely masculine, and backlit by feminine backing vocals. It's a shame that Middleton seems ready to toss his solo career away now, just when he's carved out a path for himself that is separate from Arab Strap. Waxing Gibbous is a good, if occasionally overdone, album that proves that his musical imagination is still a fertile one. That's the irony. Though he sings, ""Everything I do is redundant, everything I say is a lie,"" on ""Don't Want to Sleep Tonight"", he is singing such a sentiment over unusual electronic bloops and proggy keyboard lines that are, in fact, like nothing he's ever done before. But maybe that's why he's finally able to see the moon as half full: because it's the last one he's planning to see for a while.","The former Arab Strap multi-instrumentalist, known for his black, oddball sense of humor, makes like he's fronting the E Street Band on his fifth solo album.

Well Known Pleasures,VEGA,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f19d034d5c69bf31a7/1:1/w_160/b0afe1ed.jpg,2009-07-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13210-well-known-pleasures/,Vogue College,"Alan Palomo was wearing a Michael Jackson T-shirt in publicity photos before TMZ told us the King of Pop had left the building. Earlier, as frontman for Denton, Texas, electro-funkateers Ghosthustler, Palomo appealed to Nintendo Power Glove nostalgia in a memorable video by director Pete Ohs. Now based in Austin and leading VEGA, Palomo has moved closer to the ""dream"" side of the ""dreamwave"" descriptor coined for his acts, but he's still refashioning the past with the loving dedication of so many VHS-to-YouTube archivists. Palomo may have his Power Glove in a few too many young-urban-retro-futuristic pies. Lefse Records has just announced a release date for the upcoming debut album by Neon Indian, Palomo's project with video artist Alicia Scardetta; at their best, the group's synth-dripping bedroom-pop hypnotism rivals some of Deerhunter-er Bradford Cox's Atlas Sound home recordings. Meanwhile, in Ghosthustler, Palomo made head-banging dance-pop with the twiddly synths of Chromeo and the aggressive distortion of then-ascendant French house labels Ed Banger and KitsunÃ©. VEGA's Joy Division-referencing debut EP, Well Known Pleasures-- originally slated for May release, and finally out digitally this month-- blasts that basic sound into more cosmic-disco-influenced frontiers, with pillowy electronic drifts and proggy solos. Given the evolution in band logos, it's tempting to see VEGA as Sega to Ghosthustler's N.E.S.: same computing power, more of a ""cult"" appeal. Except Well Known Pleasures has a couple of tracks that seem a bit more immediately crowd-pleasing than anything I heard from Ghosthustler. Opener ""No Reasons"", with its chopped-up vocals and laser squiggles, is a fine piece of French-touched synth-pop that ought to win over some fans of Cut Copy. And the title track, described by Discobelle as a ""smooth synthy pop track with a nice housey feeling,"" is basically just that, though the still-developing vocals and lyrics shouldn't keep Phoenix up nights. In other places, despite taking a celestial name that most music fans probably associate with Suzanne (""Tom's Diner"", ""Luka"") or Alan (Suicide), VEGA could almost score the credits of a vintage episode of PBS's ""Nova"". Slow, dramatic arpeggios float out from high-sustain synths on space-disco power ballad ""Fondly"", which ends with the type of noodling prog-isms you'd expect on a LindstrÃ¸m epic. Closing synth lullaby ""Other End"" is over and forgotten in barely a minute and a half. But ""Kyoto Gardens"" is the only spot where VEGA really fall flat, stumbling over the same well-worn lyrical material as Little Boots' ""New in Town"" with a by now familiar formula of 80s electro, turn-of-the-millennium French house, and late-2000s spacey expansiveness. All that adds up to two pretty good tracks and three somewhat satisfying but generally unremarkable ones, in less than 30 minutes. If you're as focused on VEGA's particular niche as they are, then Well Known Pleasures might well be a pleasure. That's still a long way from the all-embracing pop of the guy on the T-shirt. I'm more excited for Palomo's future-- retro or otherwise.","Alan Palomo'sÂ (Neon Indian, Ghosthuslter) VEGA project'sÂ Joy Division-like debut EP-- originally slated for May release-- is finally out digitally this month.

The record misses frequent collaborator Stuart Matthewman and initially has an almost underwhelming live-performance feel when compared with his older records. But while it lacks the iconic significance of his debut, BLACKsummers'night is a record more than worthy of Maxwell's talents, because it trades the physical sensuality of his earlier work for a deep emotional resonance, the performance of an artist whose focus and attention to detail gives his expression a singular veracity. Maxwell's debut, Urban Hang Suite, is one of the top R&B records of the 1990s. Back then the young,Â precociousÂ singer wielded an introverted, understated persona; he seemed to have a profound understanding of himself with a quiet-spoken reserve that, when blended with incredibly crafted songwriting, came across as confidence. Here was an artist who seemed to have shaped every chord change for maximum emotional effectiveness. Maxwell was also a performer who knew that songwriting was not simply writing melodies and chord progressions, but could be structurally ambitious, with the kind of consistent unpredictability and subversiveness of the song form, embracing the unexpected, like the sudden crash after the long pause in the middle of Urban Hang Suite's ""Dancewitme"". His latest record finds these kinds of details, this external, broad-perspective view of what ""composition"" really means, the love of intricacies, its best songs balancing compositional excellence, development, and tension, with carefully designed moods that reflect or complement each work's lyrical focus. Take ""Help Somebody"", for example: Maxwell begs the listener to show love, turning such feelings into a moral imperative, tension ratcheting with a gradual build, musically searching for release that never comes, a long hopeless cry to force logic to intrude over irrational feeling. Maxwell's power is least effective when he loses this composed structure; ""Stop the World"" reaches for raw, unrehearsed expression, but without organization, it feels listless. By contrast ""Fistful of Tears"" is anchored by a Prince-inflected quarter-note harmony waltz; not coincidentally, it's also the album's most immediately affecting track. Although Maxwell has always seemed preternaturally mature, there is something new here, a depth of emotion appropriate for this level of heartbreak. ""Pretty Wings"", the lead single and album centerpiece, doesn't work in simple binaries or reductive ideas; it lays out a fair yet confused examination of a relationship's fall. Maxwell even acknowledges his own mistakes after an indictment of his partner's, creating a realization of loss and all of the intricate personal responses that implies. But what is truly powerful is that it is just as musically complex as a relationship's disintegration is emotionally. Maxwell's patience allows him to effectively write such paens to devotion; it is as if he wanted to catalog every aspect of this very human breakdown, identify each strand to create a song that fully captures, laid bare, the complex emotional terrain that wells up during such an exceptionally difficult and human experience. This level of detail carries with it a lived-in feeling, a convincing truthfulness simply because the emotions are too specific to be anything but real.

Catacombs,Cass McCombs,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d4c0084474cd0c059c/1:1/w_160/40bd6742.jpg,2009-07-10 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13180-catacombs/,Domino,"Cass McCombs works quietly. Over the course of three full-lengths and five years, McCombs has quickly slipped in and out of scenes, skipping from one major American city to the next like he owed stacks of cash in every one. He's played with folk, grafting bedroom pop flourishes to sonic skeletons just strong enough to support them. He swam through 1980s Brit jangle and deep chasms of reverb. No matter how much mileage he accrued, one constant held firm: His lyrical shell games often kept listeners at arm's length, regardless of how well-crafted and inviting his melodies were. McCombs' songs were addictively opaque-- easy to hear, tough to digest, and even more difficult to describe to your friends over beers. McCombs'Â slipperinessÂ seemed as much like a rejection and re-routing of the traditional singer-songwriter tag as it did a refusal to meet a listener halfway, as though the dude were allergic to interpretation or the idea that someone, anyone, might want to peer inside his braincave. It all sounds like a carefully conceived blend between garden-variety male vulnerability issues and wild-eyed, guitar-toting-dude-who-fancies-himself-an-enigma bullshit. But on Catacombs, his fourth full-length and most stripped-down effort to date, the singer-songwriter steps out from behind the curtain that's cloaked his work in the past. And despite the sparser arrangements and increased focus on direct lyricism, it's every bit as aurally hypnotic as his previous work. It seems like he realized there was someone he really did want to sing to. Reportedly a tribute to his wife, these are songs for the heart more than the head. Opener ""Dreams Come True Girl"" is beautiful evidence of that. It's a straight-ahead chord progression that's just a minor chord kiss away from Bright Eyes' ""First Day of My Life"" and Bob Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"". McCombs washes it in Pacific surf, lets it dry, and then flips it into a late-blossoming duet with actress Karen Black ofÂ Easy Rider andÂ Nashville fame. A stunt cameo like that could easily fog up a recording, but Black's turn and lower register compliments the feet-up vibe really well. ""You Saved My Life"" waltzes farther into territory, McCombs' croon swaying along to a bass line that never ever loses its way.Â Hammocks of pedal steel, duvets of synth, steady breaths of acoustic guitar-- it's a warm, understated arrangement that typifies music for sunlit rooms and Sunday mornings. Most impressively, there is not a trace of sap or slobber to be found anywhere. ""The Executioner's Song"" takes the same approach to speech-song serenading and despite a defiantly mid-tempo pace that borders on drowsy, its heartbeat doesn't waver. ""Harmonia"" and ""Prima Donna"" are simple strummers that recall early-70s Dylan, the former an especially strong showcase for McCombs' voice. Smooth as river stones and perfectly evocative when dipping into baritone raps or twirling in falsetto, it's fit to carry songs so bare. ""Lionkiller Got Married"" traces narrative threads back to 2007'sÂ Dropping the Writ and signals a shift towards the outwardly old-timey and too well-defined-- a rickety template that only serves to box him in. In fact, the bounce of ""Jonesy Boy"" and Main Street shuffle of ""One Way to Go"" both run on and out of steam. It's good reason to come back to the beginning though, to the track whose directness stands tall above a set with inches to spare: ""Dreams Come True Girl"". Given a song like this (the chorus straight up kills me every time), and a staggering mind/skill set like McCombs', it's remarkable that he's avoided being part of the greater discussion on great American songwriters. While Conor Oberst's been saddled/showered with New Dylan hosannas and critical tongue baths this decade, McCombs has fashioned himself a groove as new school rambler and pokerfaced tone poet totally under the radar. It's a space he seems and sounds to have been most comfortable in. Until now.","The singer-songwriter's fourth full-length is both his most stripped-down effort to date and also his best.

My Son's Home,The Roadside Graves,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4da13d1975652138de8/1:1/w_160/4fb24b98.jpg,2009-07-09 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13175-my-sons-home/,Autumn Tone,"The Roadside Graves are such an awesomely named band that you have to think somewhere there's a metal act kicking itself for not coming up with the sobriquet first. The evocatively dubbed New Jersey seven-piece may actually ply its trade in shambling folk-rock, but don't think for an instant this group's not worthy of its morbid moniker, not when the band's newest album, My Son's Home, is so deeply, resolutely soaked in bodily and spiritual dissolution. First things first, however, listening to the Roadside Graves does require a certain suspension of disbelief. These guys have taken a significant number of pages from Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes playbook, which I guess makes them doubly antiquated by dint of borrowing heavily from 60s musicians who were themselves resurrecting early 20th century song forms. Lead singer John Gleason warbles in a wavering whine that's cousin to Dylan's legendary wheeze, and musically the group makes liberal use of accordion, organ, and barroom ivories. The women you meet in these songs are going to have names like Ruby and Delia that nobody under the age of 80 actually owns anymore. Certainly these moldy affectations can be an impediment when you're trying to enjoy music on your iPod in 2009, but if you'll allow the Graves their need to play dress-up, My Son's Home is well-stocked with stirring narratives and sketches that just happen to be almost unremittingly obsessed with the crypt. Yet what's really remarkable about the record is the band's ability to treat death from so many different perspectives and with such a widely divergent range of moods and sympathies. There are moments of haunting, fragile stillness here, particularly the Josh Ritter-ish ""Wooden Walls"" and the elegiac, mandolin-trilling ""To the Sea"", yet anger flares up too, in the bitter ""God Touched Me"", a bravura mini-epic that initially rides a pulsing, faintly malevolent organ but resolves on a harmony-laden outro that evokes a demented ""Hey Jude"". As war is one of death's most helpful earthly engineers, it should be no surprise that armed combat is such a heavily recurring motif on the album as well, starting with its title track, a heartbreakingly precise snapshot of a family awaiting the return of their solider son, possibly in a coffin. Elsewhere, there are images of flowers on a brother's grave ""next to his number and name,"" a leg lost presumably in battle and a narrator who ""left a path of blood back in Vietnam."" Perhaps most admirably of all, the Roadside Graves excel at the brave and difficult paradox of suffusing death with life, injecting vivacity and humor into their reflections on mortality. Musically, the boozily raucous, devil-may-care singalong ""Ruby"" proves someone in the band's been listening to The Pogues, while lyrically it erases the line between sex and death until they're literally under the same roof (grandma dead in her chair with a Â cigarette in hand while ""you and I were on the couch touching each other""). ""Dirty Work"" revels in the same messy collision, mentioning a hearse and a father in the past tense yet concluding with a guy apparently pleasuring himself in the corner of an Elks Lodge's kitchen. And of course there's a murder ballad of sorts to boot, ""Where the Water Flows"", though in this case it's sporting a bristling college-rock riff to complement a tale wherein ""I followed her by the light of the moon"" gives way to ""they found her by the side of the road."" No time to dig a hole for this unfortunate victim, however-- the Roadside Graves have already moved on to the next last throes, the next death rattle.","The shambling folk-rock group offers its fourth album, a recordÂ deeply, resolutely soaked in bodily and spiritual dissolution.

Killingsworth,The Minus 5,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51dea9e61561daa506d/1:1/w_160/b53d625b.jpg,2009-07-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13244-killingsworth/,Yep Roc,"As a linchpin of Seattle's rock scene for the last few decades, Scott McCaughey's surely granted a few favors and garnered his share of goodwill. Still, there must be more to the guy, given the artists he's been able to call in for his ongoing project the Minus 5. As a longtime R.E.M. auxiliary player, roping in pal and Pacific Northwest neighbor Peter Buck was probably a no-brainer, as was the participation of fellow R.E.M. helper Ken Stringfellow and Jon Auer, Stringfellow's partner from the Posies. But the number of helping hands just kept growing. Soon the Minus 5, originally conceived as a solo parallel to McCaughey's ongoing Young Fresh Fellows endeavors, attracted input and contributions from members of Pearl Jam, Guided by Voices, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, and the Decemberists, among many, many others, and the list keeps getting longer. Certainly the presence of all these high-profile guests elevates the Minus 5 above mere side-project, but even so, McCaughey has done a remarkable job keeping things relatively low-key. It turns out that what McCaughey's done right all these years is rarely gone egregiously wrong. On Killingsworth, he and Buck are joined by the bulk of the Decemberists, and given that band's predilection for overblown pomp-rock you'd be forgiven for thinking this disc might follow suit. Yet everyone is on their best behavior here, subdued in service of some of McCaughey's more somber songs, mostly in mellow country-rock mode that hovers somewhere between the Byrds and Big Star (with some touches of the Dead's genial twang tossed in for good measure). Of course, the disc's unassuming demeanor may have had something to do with McCaughey's ongoing work with the Young Fresh Fellows, whose concurrent I Think This Is was produced by Robyn Hitchcock and which offers McCaughey ample opportunity to get his ya-ya's out. Yet one can't help but be impressed by McCaughey's ability to not just juggle hats but do so convincingly. Killingsworth is hardly some clearing-house but a fully realized start-to-finish album, with each of its 14 songs very much of a piece and the overall effect the farthest thing from a lark. Quality tracks like ""The Long Hall"", ""The Lurking Barrister"", ""It Won't Do You Any Good"", and ""Ambulance Dancehall"" are the sorts of songs buddy Jeff Tweedy stopped writing circa Being There, but that's not a criticism of either artist, especially considering how well McCaughey has taken to the style. McCaughey also subtly sifts through rock's storied back pages to construct the likes of ""Vintage Violet"", ""The Disembowelers"", ""Smoke On, Jerry"", ""Your Favorite Mess"", and ""Scott Walker's Fault"", the last featuring Colin Meloy on vocals. Each may be informed by familiar genre tropes and the usual musical inspirations, yet they're hardly redundant retreads. Far from it. Rather, McCaughey embraces and embodies his 1960s and 70s touchstones (twisted, as might be expected, by often sneakily subversive lyrics) but he never relies on them, so they never overwhelm the proceedings and send it into pastiche. The ever-modest McCaughey's aversion to flash may mean he'll never be as famous as many of his friends, and he knows it, but that glass ceiling has apparently also freed him. While his friends gallivant about sometimes trying too hard, he's quietly managed to foster a career in the shadows strong enough to keep pulling in those peers for a taste of the good stuff.","Young Fresh Fellows'Â Scott McCaughey andÂ R.E.M.'s Peter Buck are joined by most of the Decemberists on their latest record of country-rock and Big Star pop.

Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi,David Lynch,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5235e6ef95969320a27/1:1/w_160/7eaeca18.jpeg,2009-07-09 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13252-fox-bat-strategy-a-tribute-to-dave-jaurequi/,David Lynch MusicADA,"When asked about his relationship to music at a recent press conference, David Lynch smiled, squinted and said, ""You're listening to music sometimes and-- whoa, things just come out at you."" He paused. Then, to clarify, he offered a full minute of borderline-meaningless sentences that did nothing to explain his relationship to music but plenty to reinforce what his movies have conveyed for 30 years: Our wildest, most intense feelings crush our ability to describe them. Music-- whether an original score or licensed pop song-- is as essential to Lynch's movies as light. Blue Velvet wouldn't be Blue Velvet without Dennis Hopper's lipstick-smeared face bearing down on Kyle MacLachlan to Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams"", or without Angelo Badalamenti's score, or without the muffled throbs that come through the speakers during close-ups of fire. Eraserhead, his first feature-length, has about a page of dialogue. Without Alan Splet's nightmare of hum and clatter, most of the movie would play like unnerving surveillance footage of Jack Nance looking through his sock drawer. Fox Bat Strategy was recorded in 1994 by musicians Lynch worked with on Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, a post-series prequel shakily premise that what ""Twin Peaks"" needed was more tit and a role for David Bowie. The musicians-- who contributed a couple of instrumentals and appear in the film's club scene, mysterious in cowboy hats-- were called back by Lynch in 1994, given some lyrics, and told to improvise. Dave Jaurequi, one of the session's guitarists and namesake of the album, sang. In 2006, he passed away-- and the release of Fox Bat Strategy is Lynch's tribute to him. According to Smokey Hormel, another one of the session's guitarists, Lynch's instructions were: ""It's the 50s. It's late at night and it's been raining."" A high-school jazz band might need more guidance, but for people sensitive to Lynch's rhythm and aesthetic, the image is a siren: 1950s America is a wide circle drawn around upright Ozzie and Harriet and the glamorous nihilism of James Dean; the birth of suburbia and hellish suburban boredom; a time when teenagers were no less lusty but chaperones were more prevalent-- a time, in the words of Lynch, ""of innocence and pain mingling."" The music, then, is predictable: Low-lit, hot-breathed, soft-focus rock with some synthesizer touches-- the musical mood Lynch has explored for decades. And it's a mood that turns me so thoroughly inside out that I feel like I'm violating a colonial-era law just talking about it. Warm stuff. I've heard this vein tapped elsewhere-- in doo-wop, in Bruce Springsteen's ""I'm on Fire"" and Suicide's ""Dream Baby Dream"", in Beat Happening and, most recently, music by Deerhunter and Au Revoir Simone (a band Lynch has praised in public). But nobody seems to understand it as innately and effortlessly as Lynch. But Fox Bat Strategy, despite good intentions, doesn't carry the heft of the feeling that ""Twin Peaks"" did, or Julee Cruise's Floating Into the Night (another ""TP""-related album that Lynch ostensibly ""directed""). Jaurequi's voice is occasionally great-- masculine and somewhat anonymous, the idea of a rebel. And at best, Lynch can turn a cardboard cutout of a human being into a central character. (Nicolas Cage, deadpan, to Laura Dern in Wild at Heart: ""Did I ever tell you that this here jacket represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?"") But sometimes-- and this happens throughoutÂ Fire Walk with Me-- the result is no more than the sum of its parts. Which, in this case, means a band dressed up as Chris Isaak for Halloween. There are parts of Fox Bat Strategy that just sound like a band dressed up as Chris Isaak for Halloween. I'veÂ always thought Lynch's movies were more like music than, say, literature or drama-- art that is essentially abstract. Watching Lynch's movies is usually thrilling; talking about what they ""mean"" is usually a hassle, especially when it's with people who cling to literal meaning like ticks on dogs. As far as whether or not his movies are ""weird,"" well, Transformers is weirder. Lynch's worst work isn't even that bad, it just seems that way because people like me blow a lot of hot air defending it. His best movies, though-- and the best moments of his musical projects-- drag his audience into oceans of loose association and feelings that can't quite be boiled down or sorted out. A place where, sometimes,Â whoa-- things just come out at you.","Recorded in 1994 by musicians that David Lynch worked with onÂ Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, the filmmaker is finally now releasing the record.

War Angel,50 Cent,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a520b1335d7bf1698b16/1:1/w_160/1530d244.jpeg,2009-07-09 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13249-war-angel/,self-released,"Despite diligent scorekeeping from Internet watchdogs, there were no losers in the beef between Rick Ross and 50 Cent from earlier this year. Certainly not Ross-- befitting his completely dysfunctional relationship with reality, he took 50 as a serious threat to his non-existent credibility and somehow ended up with the best album of his life. Not 50 either-- hilarious transmissions from ThisIs50.Com served as better promotion for When I Get Around to It (or whatever he's calling his TBA follow-up to Curtis) than any of his recent singles.  And if you were a fan who didn't feel the need to choose sides, or young enough to consider Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Ricky Steamboat the equal of KRS and Rakim in 1988, it was rap-as-Wrestlemania at its finest. So why theÂ *War Angel LP? *50's gone on record saying the LP appendage in the title is necessary to let rappers know they need to act like 50's competing with them for a record deal, mixtape or not. Granted, he's been popping this ""back to basics"" shit since before Curtis (we saw how that ended up), and the biggest problem is how 50 is trying to get back to a version of himself that never existed. Even with Power of the Dollar, you didn't rely on 50 for hot punchlines, detailed street narratives, or thoughtful wordplay. You could tell from the start that he was primed to embody the New York Yankees state of mind-- when they're winning, their arrogance and loose spending make them a fantastic heel; when they're losing, you just get pissed that you're still forced to care. He's at his best when he's at his most mercenary (as if you have to be reminded, he's made two albums called Get Rich or Die Trying), and on War Angel, 50 raps like someone who knows better than to give quality shit away for free. Forget ""48 Laws of Power""-- you'd think 50 brushed up on Hobbes'Â Leviathan the way every warfaring and solitary track is nasty,Â brutish, and short, with verses of anonymous threats that begin and end at almost completely arbitrary points. Like it was a latter-day Kool Keith album. And although his lisping, sing-song cadence is still a hell of salesman for any hook he comes up with, here he mostly just repeats the song's title over and over again. Like it was a latter-day Kool Keith album. And the album's clear highlight is a skit boasting a possibly fictional event in the projects with completely random guest stars (all the kids get taken to Great Adventure after a pickup game featuring Tim Thomas and Rafer Alston). Like aâ¦seriously, are Pimpin' Curly and Dr. Dooom drinking buddies? Sure, it's an internet-only mixtape whose sole cost is about 30 minutes of your time, but what makes this truly depressing is how close it sounds to his actual studio records-- turns out he's partial to short-arms/deep-pockets imitation of Dre whether Interscope is financing it or not. We can't even get the kinds of diss tracks we should expect from a guy who'll never run out of money:Â You'd think he'd at least use ""London Girl"" as a vessel for, I dunno, a decent Estelle gag or subliminals at Kanye, but instead you get five seconds of the worst British accent ever heard. That's really the worst part of this project: On earlier mixtapes, 50 castigated rappers who took themselves too seriously. But here heÂ comes off like another guy whose stint on Aftermath took all the fun out rapping. It's not surprising that ""I'll Do Anything"" is the lone passable track on War Angel, since 50's area of expertise as of late is making sex-for-financial-security songs so condescending that they actually manage to attain a bizarre sincerity. ""I can't fit in with these niggaz, man!/ I mean niggaz got mohawks!/ And wearin' skinny jeans."" That's about as clever of a skewering as we get here, not even worth the effort of pointing out that it's a curious attack on rap masculinity from a guy who has never shot an album cover with a shirt on. In actuality, 50 Cent fits in absurdly well in today's rap-is-pop landscape, lest we forget that ""Best I Ever Had"" will never catch on with your little sister and parents like ""In Da Club"" or even ""P.I.M.P."" did. It's not that he doesn't fit in, he's been passed by and is now hip-hop's easiest rite of passage: outsold by Kanye, ignored by Wayne, artistically outstripped by Rick fucking Ross, and even the Game can't seem to be bothered these days. Good thing Relapse came out, because that seems like the only way we'll hear 50 Cent on a platinum record in 2009.","This internet-only mixtape finds 50 Cent trying to peddle someÂ ""back to basics"" shit that never actually figured in his career in the first place.

LP,Discovery,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56e5e6ef95969320ace/1:1/w_160/fff62b97.jpg,2009-07-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13314-lp/,XL,"And to think: People considered Vampire Weekend divisive. How about a V-dub spinoff featuring their keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij (the dude who typically looks like he's wearing threeÂ keffiyehsÂ to everyone else's one) and Wes Miles from Ra Ra Riot (the dude who looks like...well, until our recent Pitchfork TV shoot with them even we weren't sure what he looked like) making bedroom R&B? It worked for Junior Boys, right? Granted, they pulled it off with precision, style, and disarming observations about heartache. Discovery, true to their name, sound more simply wide-eyed and eager.Â In fact, the whole thing comes off like one in a line of acts from the Shaggs to Jonathan Richman to Grandmaster Flash to Orange Juice, artists so in love with big, communicative pop that they had to take a shot at making the stuff-- technical, financial, or God-given limitations be damned. So sure, knees are going to jerk just from the description, albeit for questionable reasons. Because there's nothing inherently wrong with the approach here, it's just the execution that can frustrate.Â The idea that a few eager white kids can't play with contemporary notions of R&B is of course a load of bullshit. See: Dirty Projectors, the E Street Band, the Rolling Stones-- hell, the whole British Invasion. Cringing at some people because they appropriate the textures and sounds of modern black music is a weirdly conservative and territorial reaction that forgets that quite a bit (if not all) of the forward momentum of pop/rock music over the past five decades was due to cultural cross-pollination. Cynics could sneer that pop/rock stopped having forward momentum a few decades ago and they'd have a point, and the sort of wannabe duality that leads people to piss and moan about the mere existence of a group like Discovery is arguably part of the problem and the reason why that momentum arguably halted in the first place. So, yeah, there is going to be a lot of contextual talk about Discovery, same as there was about VW. And this thing is even a divisive listen: The first half is weirdly awesome in places, confounding in that exciting way where someone comes along and ruptures expectations, creating something both straightforward and pleasing that's also head-scratching. Discovery's sonic strengths bring to mind VW, boostingÂ Batmanglij's claim as the central figure in the latter's sound. The groups' music aren't directly related-- there's no highlife or soukous influence in Discovery, and there might not be a single shared instrument between the two. But the spacial relationship and the approach to sonics are similar:Â Batmanglij'sÂ tones in both places are rounded and warm, eschewing the harsh mid-range of many current recordings. Space and pauses are important, giving the songs a dramatic tilt even when they're primitively constructed. Simplicity is the rule with both, repetition is often key, and in each case, the bands pleasantly (too pleasantly, for some tastes) draw in a listener rather than bludgeon them. The record kicks off with ""Orange Shirt"", ""Osaka Train Loop"", and ""Can You Discover?"", a quietly audacious 1-2-3 of quirky songs about playing pretend jetsetter made by a couple ofÂ quietlyÂ quirky guys playing pretend pop stars. It's like an extended dismantling of Dirty Projectors' ""Stillness Is the Move"" spreading the parts over three songs, creating a more straightforward facsimile than that art-obsessed project would ever dream of. Eventually they even invite Dirty Projectors' Angel Deradoorian to do that melismatic skat thing she does all over ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"". ""So Insane"" then shows up with Miles picking up Deradoorian's stop-start vocals and, holy shit, they're kind of pulling this off. And then, the second half of the record. There's a solid Ezra Koenig collab here but for the most part the whole thing starts to go from crisp and pulsing to sort of static and mushy. The rank amateurishness of the producers comes to the fore, and starts to sound like kids playing dress-up Justin Timberlake; less modern geek-pop, more bad ""Sleng Teng""/M.I.A. goofs and a teeth-gnashing cover of the Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"". In essence, the first half sounds like they're making music without looking over their shoulders-- it's most assuredly their sensibilities, they're simply working with a different set of tools and aims than with their typical groups. Then the second sounds like pastiche, like tongues becoming lodged into cheeks as a substitute for having anything at all to say, musically or lyrically. Weird thing is, most people will have less of a fence-sitting take. This could be your favorite or most-hated record of the year, and there aren't many records one could say that about. But here, the split really comes down to choices in instrumentation, i.e., favoring electronics over guitars. As I moaned in an otherwise enthusiastic review of (the still underrated!) Dark Was the Night compilation earlier this year, there are some sad filters regarding the so-called roots of sounds increasingly being applied to certain sections of the indie rock spectrum. The indie world can't live on fingerpicking and textural guitars alone, and a variety of sounds and multiculturalism in indie rock isn't the enemy here; shitty Jackson 5 covers are.","Vampire Weekend keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij and Ra Ra Riot singer Wes Miles put their own spin on modern R&B.

Golden Oldies / Shitgaze Anthems,Psychedelic Horseshit,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a567ea9e61561daa5122/1:1/w_160/d0d10ce7.jpg,2009-07-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13310-golden-oldies-shitgaze-anthems/,Wasted Vinyl,"Surely you've heard the party line on this newish crop of lo-fi revivalists: given enough time wading in the muck, you start to filter out the noise and the song remains. Certainly that much is true for the best of them; as for the recent avalanche of also-rans, the tightrope walk between craft and crunch tends to leave one wanting for more of both. So what's to be done with a band like Psychedelic Horseshit, who've got little interest in pop of any sort, who make their extraneous noise out of necessity rather than some aesthetic choice, and who, through their limited recording budgets and less than sophisticated songwriting prowess, are kind of not a lot of fun to listen to? En route to their forthcoming sophomore full-length Too Many Hits (this seems unlikely), Psychedelic Horseshit have dropped a few curios that explain this band's unique, er, appeal: Golden Oldies, a collection of CD-Rs and other small-batch material that predates their 2007 LP debut Magic Flowers Droned, and Shitgaze Anthems, a collection of would-be B-sides from the aforementioned Hits LP. Placed in order, one can see something like progress in Psychedelic Horseshit's sound: Oldies is especially turgid and tune-averse, Magic Flowers adds a lot of dynamism to the thick-as-a-brick mix, and Anthems is a little longer and more carefully wrought (though even here, there's still plenty of 'tude and not a lot of what most folks consider hooks). Even at their most braying, there's something to Psychedelic Horseshit's songs. When so moved, they can juice the lo-fi production aesthetic into something far less brittle and caged-in than that qualifier often signifies, and Matt Whitehurst's misanthropy (anyone who's heard Magic Flowers Droned's ""New Wave Hippies"" in concert knows that whole Wavves-bashing incident was hardly isolated) does make for some amusing phrasings. But you could wait roughly forever for maybe 80% of the songs to all of a sudden appear out of the ether here; confident as they are in their slack, stoney, surf-and-mod-tinged no wave, one gets the feeling some of that confidence lies in a belief that almost nobody is going to listen to this weird music beyond the dudes making it and a few passing burnouts. Certainly that much seems true of Golden Oldies, which makes it tough to recommend. These aren't quite demos, but as songs, they're half-baked at best, half-formed at worst. It's awfully long, lacks cohesion by design, and finds a skronky, idiot-savanty band at their loudest and dumbest. Oldies is not the best introduction to their work, but it is perhaps the finest microcosm of their charm. Of the 20 tracks, you could count on one hand the number you'll remember even after a dozen listens. The chronologically arranged set gets less dunderheaded and more tuneful as it plays, and once you get around to the Summertime Suicide EP-- with its appropriately sunny ""Anxiety of Influence"" and true shitgaze anthem ""Nothing Is New""-- you do start to see a band worth giving a damn about emerging, even if you're not having much fun in the discovery. Psychedelic Horseshit at times recall the early Pavement singles later collected on Westing (By Musket and Sextant)-- snide charm and crappy sound figure heavily into the success of both. And, like Westing, you're better off listening to Oldies in their original EP-size chunks. This much scuzz at once, coupled with Matt Whitehurst's oft-impenetrable but generally downtrodden lyrics, can be too much bum-out for a single sitting. The snide charm thing's still very much the thing on the six songs that make up Shitgaze Anthems; the first song is called ""We're Pink Floyd, Bitch"", which, even with the spacey keyboard lick around the chorus, they are so not. But the song-to-skronk ratio strongly favors the former, the sound occasionally veers into the middle-fi, and the tunes typically don't just go from noisy to noisier as they do on Oldies; if you don't find yourself pumping your fist to the chugging X-like intro of ""Dreadlock Paranoia"", you might just find yourself nodding your head to the dub that closes out the track, and that the song spans genres should tell you what you need to know about the progress that's been made between discs. Sure, in the band's past work there are hints of the twangy, stoney rave-up of ""Are You on Glass"" and the can't-believe-I'm-calling-this-gorgeous 5 a.m. balladry of ""As In Dreams Pt. 2"". But never before have so many of their good ideas worked out quite so well. It's still squelchy, uncompromising, uneven music, still not quite meeting the ""pop"" part of ""noise-pop"" halfway, but these are far better songs for them to squelch over, and far more vibrant squelching is taking place here. Shitgaze is not exactly brilliant, and it's still far from what most people consider fun listening. But if these truly are the cast-offs from the next full-length, well, Too Many Hits might have a couple, actually. Fun remains to be seen.","Two collections of stray tracks and cast-offs from a band far more interested in the skronky part of the noise-pop equation.

Drift,Nosaj Thing,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a522b1335d7bf1698b1d/1:1/w_160/26e2d537.jpg,2009-07-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13251-drift/,Alpha Pup,"Nosaj Thing is Jason Chung, a 24-year-old producer from California with loose ties to Flying Lotus and the L.A. glitch-hop scene. His gorgeously haunted debutÂ DriftÂ makes it clear that while he shares a lot with Flying Lotus-- a base of operations, like-minded compatriots, a deep love of hip-hop and a thousand strains of electronic music-- they'reÂ pretty far apart in terms of approach. Spatially speaking, Flying Lotus' music is like a cluttered studio apartment overflowing with interesting bric-a-brac-- hip-hop records, comics, pieces of modern art. Chung's music,Â meanwhile, is spacious and reverberant, every element echoing into the emptiness surrounding it.Â DriftÂ came out on Alpha Pup, the label run by underground hip-hop producer Daddy Kev, and Nosaj Thing produced tracks on Busdriver's latest record, butÂ DriftÂ has little of anything that might be recognized as ""hip-hop"" on it, none of Flying Lotus' breakbeats or his analog-tape warmth. From a mood point of view, its gloomy beatscapes have a lot more in common with the bass-heavy London dubstep scene than anything his fellow L.A. laptop nerds are doing. *Drift'*s dubstep influence is immediately apparent in the chilly minor-key synths and fractured, ghostly drum programming of ""Us"" and ""Fog"", which evokes Burial. Chung has a similar flair for atmospherics and fondness for dank spaces; the drum sounds on ""IOIO"" resemble both the dripping of leaky pipes and swarming, squeaking rats. He also shares a firm belief that great drum sounds come from everywhere. On ""1685/Bach"", for instance, they come from the peeling of masking tape and jingling change. This magpie ear for odd, leftfield sounds isÂ Drift's most explicit link to glitch-hop. The endlessly pinging synthesizer on ""Light #1"" seems to careen off every available surface, while it's companion ""Light #2"" builds from a prism ofÂ Tron-like laser blurts. Chung clearly relishes a good rug-pulling, and he plays a thousand little tricks on your senses throughout the record-- breathing sounds fluttering high in the mix, echoing, hall-of-mirrors synthesizers. Occasionally, things get a little too lava-lamp; I wouldn't want to listen to ""Coat of Arms"" while stoned, as I think the halting strobe-light effect might make me seasick. Chung is clearly also fascinated by darkness and impenetrability, andÂ Drift is filled with nighttime sounds. The brief moments of light, when they penetrate, feel slightly unreal; the woozy major chords of ""2222"" sound submerged, an impression reinforced by the sucking sounds surrounding them, similar to the noises you hear in your ears as you swim for the surface of a pool. At the two-minute mark in ""Light #1"" synths streak across the track like shafts of sunlight, and on ""Lords"", the final track, we're surprised by the late entrance of a rarely heard sound on the LP-- harmonized human voices, relatively untouched by filtering and effects, cooing wordlessly. It's a last dose of cold water to the face on a record full of such moments. There are sonic Easter Eggs for a thousand listens here, and it would take six pairs of headphones and an equal number of high-grade strains of weed to track them all down. Happy hunting.","Like Flying Lotus, Nosaj Thing has a greatÂ ear for odd, leftfield sounds andÂ makes gorgeously haunted, glitch-y hip-hop.

Back to the Feature,Wale,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a519c0084474cd0c0648/1:1/w_160/7795a5d1.jpeg,2009-07-08 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13241-back-to-the-feature/,self-released,"No upside. Skills won't translate to the ""next level."" Gimmicky. If he's on the wrong team, he'll be exposed as a limited talent who's been coddled by swagger-hating purists. Wale loves himself some NBA namedrops, so even as The Mixtape About Nothing stands as one of 2008's best rap albums, it can't sit well with him that his detractors talk about him as if he were college star/NBA rookie Tyler Hansborough. Especially since he closes out Back to the Feature by coincidentally comparing himself to Psycho T's new teammate, the far more physically dominant scoring machine Danny Granger. So it's understandable that he's gotten a little defensive on Back to the Feature, if not a little worrying-- Nothing's biggest risk wasn't its sampling of Seinfeld, but the spots where he threatened to get too caught up in the navel-focused minutiae of being an up-and-coming rapper (answering MySpace requests, Soundscan numbers, etc.). Despite Feature's motivation (""we just wanna let these broads know, [we] be rappin'""), the secondary theme is constraint-- being boxed into the same old comparisons (Lupe, Lil' Wayne) and the fishbowl effect of internet tastemaking, where the ability of haters to bring him down far exceeds his ability to rise above it. ""Think Barack got it bad, try being a rapper"" goes a particularly overreaching line, and if Wale isn't exactly gunning down his detractors, he's at least trying to let them in to more than just his shoe closet (though he still boasts about having property in Beaverton and ""Phil knight talking about, 'How you got them?'""). You might not think that was the case judging from the features-- Talib Kweli, Royce Da 5'9"", Joe Budden,Â Skyzoo, Joell Ortiz. Basically, if you've heard someone recently complain about how post-Kanye and/or southern trends have ruined hip-hop, those are the guys they're probably saying you need to listen to instead. True or not, it's hard to overlook the fact that all of these guys are super talents, and in terms of pure quotables, Feature has few peers this year. The feature-heavy lineup can detract from Wale being able to display his personality, a sort of Everyman that skirts the usual blue-collar connotations of that word to embody the sort of person for whom constant immersion in ESPN.com results in pop culture references finding themselves infecting every part of their life-- from relationship dust-ups (""I wouldn't fuck another girl out in the club/ I was Rodney Stuckey, wasn't giving my number up,""), to dealing with overzealous fans (""They be hawkin'/ I call them hoes Josh Smith"") to just general shit-talk (""new MJ's hurting their eyes like Amare,"" ""you ain't doin' shit til you putâ¦uhâ¦10 g's on fantasy football""). I could listen to him go off on that all day. But the idea of Wale being only as good as his team takes on added weight in terms of the production-- though he boasts that 9th Wonder is a legend with all kinds of beats, here he's more content to ladle out bowls of turn-of-the-decade comfort food that envision a dystopia where Little Brother's The Minstrel Show actually guided the course of hip-hop. It's most certainly a gimmick move to rap over Peter Bjorn and John's ""Nothing to Worry About"", but also kind of a relief to hear Wale on a beat where the drums don't sound like they're stuffed with down comforters. Not surprisingly, the most exciting stuff here comes when just about anyone other than 9thÂ is behind the boards-- ""Um Ricka"" features unsurprisingly horn-heavy production from Mark Ronson, but more surprisingly is how K'Naan can do an obvious ""hey, you think you can rap about Africa?"" verse and not sound like he's done it dozens of times already. Even better is Ronson's grimy, Premiere-evoking ""Pot of Gold"" as well as the surprisingly underutilized Best Kept Secret, who expertly handles the waterworks on the closing ""New Soul"". Plus if Wale's DMV thing ever falls through, I'd hope he'd consider relocating to Philadelphia to become a permanent member of State Property-- ""Cyphr"" and ""Hot Shyt"", as their titles indicate, are little more than a bunch of guys rapping their asses off over minimally dressed bangers, and few do it better than Black Thought, Freeway, Peedi Crakk, and here even Young Chris. Back to the Feature certainly stands as a worthy follow-up to The Mixtape About Nothing, but I can't help but think of it in the terms of how 2007's most unorthodox commercial success story (the ""Radiohead model"") bears such [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| similarity to 2008's (the ""Lil' Wayne model"")-- the fact that they're considered ""models"" instead of a strange commingling of irreplicable circumstances has hurt way more artists than it helped, especially those without a decade's worth of goodwill. With Wale and hip-hop in general, it feels even more pronounced: ""They used to call me the future/ A month later, say ""fuck it-- I've grown used to him'."" It's not an easy situation to be in, to have fans who bitch about how rappers aren't making classic albums anymore, but expect nearly constant production from the new guys. But as Asher Roth and Charles Hamilton and such have ultimately proven, it's not like those people are really the fans worth staking your career on. If tapes like Back to the Feature are what we can expect from Wale should this whole ""ft. Lady Gaga"" thing not work out, that's fine, but instead of shouting out his classmates in the XXL Freshman 10, he might want to put up his Nike Boots for a minute and learn from their mistakes.","Another excellent mixtape finds Wale reveling in anÂ Everyman persona that skirts blue-collar connotations to embody an immersion in ESPN results and pop culture.

Ye Gods (And Little Fishes),Martin Carr,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5315e6ef95969320a49/1:1/w_160/0704e909.jpeg,2009-07-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13265-ye-gods-and-little-fishes/,Sonny Boy,"Martin Carr spent the 1990s writing songs and playing guitar for the Boo Radleys, one of the most idiosyncratic bands ever to be lumped in with the Britpop thing, a movement they really weren't a part of. Their Wake Up! LP scored them a couple of hits, but it's the previous record, Giant Steps that really showed Carr's incredible scope as a writer. He could do catchy blasts of sunshine, dub freakouts, noise opuses, straight-ahead rock, and intentional kitsch with equal aplomb. His solo career after the band split in 1999, carried out primarily under the stage name Brave Captain, has embraced a similar eclecticism-- Carr's last album under that name, the 2006 free download Distractions, was loaded with electronic textures and even some decent rap courtesy of Akira the Don. His first album under his given name is more of a back-to-basics thing. It's as friendly as Wake Up! and the Boo'sÂ Kingsize, but also more stripped down and intimate. It could just be that Carr is writing these songs for himself to sing-- he wrote songs for Sice Rowbottom to sing with the Radleys, and though they have similar-sounding voices, Sice was more at home belting and yelping, while Carr prefers a very English sort of understatement. Opener ""The Dead of Winter"" could be a leftover from Carr's mid-90s heyday-- it sounds familiar the second time you hear it, like it's been with you for years. It features a tumbling vocal melody, blasting horn theme, frantic drums and nasty guitar break that keeps you guessing which sides Carr is going to show on the rest of the record. Mostly, he shows his quiet side on brooding songs such as the dark, undulating ""Tired, Broken, Black and Blue"" and the slow crawl ""Pontcanna Stone"", where he gets in a haunting lead guitar part that drifts through the song as though some part of it were smoldering, giving off waves of heat. The album's six-minute centerpiece, ""Goldrush '49"", is built up from a few simple acoustic guitar phrases to a long, stretched-out chant of nothing but the word ""California"". Carr can still deploy an easy melodicism seemingly at will, as the late-album duo ""Orpheus Lament"" and ""Running"" demonstrate. He gives one of the best songs to his wife, Mary, to sing. ""Why You Gotta Bring Me All This Rain?"" is one of those awesome, miserable British slow songs that inevitably makes you feel better about things after listening to it. Though it lacks the conscious ambition and open challenge of his best work, Ye Gods (And Little Fishes) is still a very pleasing album, and Carr is way past the point where he needs to open up a bag of tricks to make impressive music. If you and Carr last communicated when he was still a Boo Radley, this might be a good time to get re-acquainted, and if you've followed the Brave Captain through every stage of his voyage, you'll certainly want to take this opportunity to get to know him on a more personal level.","After a series of records credited to Brave Captain, the former Boo Radleys leader releases his first LP under his given name.

Anok Pe: Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain,Current 93,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47cb1335d7bf1698994/1:1/w_160/d2ecb376.jpg,2009-07-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13108-anok-pe-aleph-at-hallucinatory-mountain/,Coptic Cat,"Four tracks into Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain, David Tibet finally relaxes his draconian, dramatic voice: ""My teeth are possessed by demons and devils/ And I was by myself but not myself,"" he offers calmly through a patter of circular jazz drumming and a stout bass throb. For Tibet, who's spent many of the last 30 years pushing against reductive self-definition in Current 93, these two lines might be as close to an artist's statement as we'll ever get.Â  Tibet has long written from the troubled threshold between his mind and God, juxtaposing images of himself as a heretic and an acolyte while sorting through interpretations of Christianity, mysticism, the occult, and the inane. In Tibet's gnostic vision, none of us-- God included-- is perfect or beyond reproach, so Current 93's oeuvre serves as a tool for self-flagellation and self-assessment. On his 1992 masterpiece, Thunder Perfect Mind, Tibet suggested that, ""In the dark, you must look in your heart."" With Aleph, Tibet-- a devout Christian who reads the Bible in Greek and occasionally writes and sings in the ancient Coptic language-- recognizes his troubles in another moment of solitary desolation. This time, he's asking for help. Behooving a sinner, Tibet's rarely been alone for his most personal explorations: From Antony Hegarty and Ben Chasny to sound artist Hilmar Ãrn Hilmarsson and Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton, he's amassed a revolving army to provide sounds worthy of such intimate and existential conflicts. Aleph is a charging, rock'n'roll appraisal of Tibet's central concern-- living with respect to himself and to God-- supported by one of the best casts yet. Stapleton, improvisational drummer Alex Neilson, Chavez's Matt Sweeney, and harpist Baby Dee return, along with Andrew W.K., Rickie Lee Jones, guitarists James Blackshaw and Keith Wood, and the artistically ambitious porn star Sasha Grey. Carefully orchestrated beneath Tibet's uncanny voice, they create not only Current 93's most rock-oriented album to date but also a fine, fitting crown for Tibet's prolific decade. A surprisingly tuneful, consistently compelling mix of industrial stomp and folk grace, Aleph offers both a career-spanning capitulation for newcomers and a bold push forward for zealots. As with most of Current 93's albums, specifically 2006's sprawling, apocalyptic dream-state manifesto, Black Ships Ate the Sky, Aleph is a concept album of connected scenes and themes. At its center stands an exploration of the archetypes we often reduce into binaries-- good and evil, dark and light, God and Satan. Aleph, the murderer, and Adam, Eden's original innocent, personify the warring factions of Tibet's mind. Instead of opposites, he makes them equals, where the existence of one implies the other: ""Almost in the beginning was the murderer,"" two children chant by way of introduction, Tibet reverting to his decades-old trope of letting the most innocent of babes reveal the most difficult of truths. Purity doesn't last long, and anything less would be unbearable, the album posits. For instance, during its triumph, ""Not Because the Fox Barks"", Aleph has given into goodness and is ""creating starlings with brightness."" Bored and brooding, he hates it. Tibet understands: ""This is Terminal Eden/ A killer of dreams/ Of hopes/ Of galaxies."" Aleph rages again against Adam. Aleph's music synthesizes many of Current 93's directions over the last three decades into a potent, relatively lean 54 minutes. In the early 1980s, Tibet emerged from a stint in Psychic TV with a handful of audacious industrial albums, in particular 1984's Dogs Blood Rising. Though certainly not formless, Rising bent barbaric howls and noise floods into long tracks that treated traditional song structure and quiet as anathema. In the late 80s, inspired by a nascent interest in English folk, Tibet shifted to vaguely song-oriented music written largely for acoustic instruments. Aside from various electronic pieces (see the excellent Faust and I Have a Special Plan for This World) and several heavy exceptions, Tibet's long kept his intensity but foregone the early cacophony. But Aleph unites those extremes imaginatively, plating rather pretty arrangements with slabs of distortion. Serrated drones slowly overrun the 12-string Blackshaw array that opens ""Poppyskins"", while blades of cello knife through the lumbering metal of ""On Docetic Mountain"". Drummer Neilson bridges both aesthetics, pushing the songs forward but complicating with nuance. It's arguably the most populist music Tibet's ever made. Unfortunately, no amount of explanation or influence can move many beyond the hurdles of Tibet's chilling voice or his earnest quest for religious revelation. And, sure, Tibet can sound like the Devil himself, and any lyricist that's as wont to reference Reese Witherspoon or Tupperware as he is to recite scripture or quote in Coptic is bound to frustrate the majority. Perhaps the rising stars of writers like the Hold Steady's Craig Finn or Destroyer's Dan Bejar-- both wild-voiced poets who compose in hypertext, connecting ideas across multiple releases while incorporating rapacious literary minds-- have expanded our collective interest in singers who sound like no one else and write with something bigger in mind than the next hook. If so, David Tibet's got approximately 50 records waiting in his back catalog, with the latest-- the excellent Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain-- suggesting he's still a long way from the Omega.","This guest-heavy album-- Andrew W.K., James Blackshaw, Rickie Lee Jones, porn star Sasha Grey-- is David Tibet's most rock-oriented to date.

Now I Am Champion,Sister Suvi,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46cc0084474cd0c04af/1:1/w_160/24685fa9.jpg,2009-07-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13094-now-i-am-champion/,Common Cloud,"Sister Suvi are a strange meeting of three very different minds. Strangest of the three is Merrill Garbus (tUnE-YaRds), whose swooping voice and arch ukulele make her sound like she just escaped from the circus. Drummer Nico Dann is her opposite: a fiendishly precise percussionist with jazzbo credentials, Dann is as straight and unflappable as a Hal Hartley leading man. And Patrick Gregoire (also of Islands), a self-described indie rock guy with a moaning tenor, is the fulcrum. I first caught Sister Suvi on a bill with Canadian compatriots Shapes and Sizes, who are another eclectic and free-thinking band with an engaging female lead beside a stolid male. But Sister Suvi rightly took the headlining spot: where that band has found its style in fits and starts, Sister Suvi jumped in up to their chin. The ""Montoronto""-basedÂ trio brings a raft of influences to their first full-length, Now I Am Champion, and it takes a couple of listens to enjoy all its strengths. The first impression, from singles like the breakneck ""The Lot"" or Zeppelin-esque ""Golden"", is of an off-kilter indie rock act.  The production is raw but muddy, and when the songs get loud-- and all of them do-- the guitars smear and the vocals can be a blur. But then you catch the stellar bass lines (by both Gregoire and Garbus), the groovy shimmy of ""Desolation"", and the jazz/reggae rhythm and psychotic lyrics of ""American"".Â The three-part harmonies are brash but complex, and Dannâs drum parts are relentlessly fascinating. And Garbus sports a uke, but she never treats it gently: The amplification makes it an aggressive lead instrument, and it also sounds great bowed, as on ""Longlegs"". All three member split lead vocals, but when Garbus takes the mic, she risks stealing the show. Each of her songs sticks her in a new weird character, tossing political and religious signifiers like cherry bombs and giving the album its centerpiece on ""American"", a song that mixes the daffy with the depraved: Even as she waxes poetic about her ""tushy,"" she sings a song about a love so destructive that it has to see guts and flesh to feel realized. Whether it's about obsessive love, or an allegory for how we like to export the American dream guns-first, the song is a captivating horror show. The weird whoops and calls on title track ""Champion"" may warm up the song, but you'll stay for the chorus, where Garbus tears loose: Her wail is huge and vast, and the band rises just as quickly. As the most flamboyant member of the trio it would be easy for her to dominate it, and thankfully she doesn't.  Sister Suvi are a collaborative trio, three different but equal partners who just found a repertoire that set them all on fire. And they sound like they're just getting started.","Members of Islands andÂ tUnE-YaRds collaborate on thisÂ eclectic and free-thinking project.

The Sound of UK Funky,Ministry of Sound,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51b13d1975652138e82/1:1/w_160/0fe84fdf.jpeg,2009-07-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13243-the-sound-of-uk-funky/,Ministry of Sound,"UK funky has been the most exciting thing in dance music the past 18 months or so, but it nonetheless remains a tricky thing to pin down. After all, what is UK funky other than house music produced by Londoners? Sure, it's house produced by refugees from UK garage and grime looking to have a good time while bringing their sonic and stylistic baggage with them: But, well, so what? It's still just house, isn't it? But UK funky is both ""just house"" in its most conventional sense and also ""other than house"" in pretty much every manner that is worth pursuing. It's house at the point where house becomes rave, R&B, rap, dancehall, soca, and, a lot of the time, just manic percussion. But also, a lot of the time, just house. All of which makes packaging this emerging genre a difficult proposition: UK Funky is like a magic eye picture, its startling multi-genre topography invisible to the naked eye until you discover, perhaps by accident, the right perspective from which to observe it. For many listeners, myself included, the right perspective was provided by the imposition of the MC. On a good radio set-- mixing fast and loose from one track to next, treating full-blown songs like they're functionalist riddims-- the MC confirms that the closest fit for funky's sensibility is dancehall: hence the obsessive focus on dance crazes, the trash'n'treasure opportunism of its sonic eclecticism, and, most importantly, the unlikely balancing act of its covalent relationship between vocal and groove, mouth and body. In its overdue attempt to come to grips with UK funky, the Ministry of Sound stable was never going to allow an MC to spoil proceedings, if only because this might alienate listeners expecting a more conventional take on ""funky house."" Partly as a result, this slick 3xCD collection cannot capture the ravey excitement of a the best funky radio shows (so search, if you can, Mak 10 and MC Shantie's set for Deja Vu FM). But these reservations aside, Ministry of Sound Presents the Sound of UK Funky is about as good as anyone reasonably could have hoped. Well, nearly: the mostly great first disc courtesy of Pioneer can drift into tepid territory at times, keen to remind you [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| of the music's roots in the more polite end of U.S. house. But the second and third discs, mixed by Footloose and Supa D respectively, are mostly spectacular. Of the two, Supa D gets the lion's share of current scene anthems, from Crazy Cousinz's peerless xylophone workout ""Inflation"" to the hyperactive electro-dancehall of Perempay & Dee's ""Buss It"" to the rippling but rough bongo fetishism of Fr3e's ""Tribal Skank"" (spoilt somewhat by the addition of a perfunctory and uninspired vocal). But if Supa D's set is strongest track-for-track, Footloose's set is the more enjoyable by a small margin, perhaps because it edges closer to portraying UK funky in its absolute best light. Put this down to the irrepressible energy of Footloose's mixing, the way he impatiently jumps from one track to the next, or teases out transitions to create hybrid tracks where competing rhythms jut into one another like rotor blades. It also seems to be mixed slightly faster, giving snare-heavy tunes like Crazy Cousinz's remix of Kid Cudi vs Crookers' ""Day 'N' Nite"" or Tru's remix of Karizma's ""Darqness"" a steroidal muscularity they might lack at a more stately tempo. Funky's stumbling but cheerful rhythms seem primed to soundtrack alcohol consumption rather than drug use, but at their manic best these selections latch onto that fleeting moment at the very beginning of drunkenness, when enthusiasm and adrenalin bring on a rush of energy that's as dangerous as it is enjoyable. What Footloose and Supa D's sets share is an almost perverse attraction to the genre's extremities: both take a childish delight in jumping from sweet vocal tunes to menacing percussive numbers and back again. So Footloose switches from the hyper-intense rave-soca of his remix of Brasstooth's ""Celebrate Life"" into the slinky Latin swish of Delio D'Cruz vs KCAT's ""Get Off The Wall"", all high-pitched vocals and shiveringly delicate beats, while Supa D overlays the sly R&B of L.A. Cartier's ""Call Me"" with a full minute of overbearing, clanking tribal drums from Bakongo's ""Bambara"". But UK funky isn't solely about this kind of outer-edge gymnastics. Rounding out Supa D's disc, the driving piano stomp and yearning, ghostly male vocals of Fuzzy Logik's ""The Way You Move"" offer a simple, moving love letter to classicist early house, while closer ""I Feel"" by Nat-Mor is simply timeless, delectable vocal garage, its lush groove and stirring diva chorus temporarily making ""other than house"" seem like a pointless destination. It's not, but UK funky's fetish for transformation isn't pursued at the expense of remembering its origins, and the resulting conflation of past, present, and future offers the best of all possible worlds.","The most exciting strain of dance music the past 18 months, UK funky-- an offshoot of UK garage and grime-- finally gets a sprawling, solid introduction.

Hometowns,The Rural Alberta Advantage,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b4b1335d7bf1698555/1:1/w_160/e02efe1b.jpeg,2009-07-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12739-hometowns/,Saddle Creek,"Over the course of the past 10 or so years-- from Neutral Milk Hotel to Arcade Fire to Bright Eyes-- winking detachment has ceded an increasing amount of indie rock ground to unmockable earnestness. Next in that line of serious, and seriously emotive, songwriters are the Rural Alberta Advantage. The Toronto-based trio, led by born-and-bred Albertan Nils Edenloff, has created an affecting debut that's full of nostalgic songs about hometowns (hence its title) and heartbreaks, marrying salt-of-the-earth acoustic rock to energetic rhythms and grand orchestral arrangements. Even Edenloff's nasal, impassioned singing and lyricism are practically naked in their straightforward sincerity. Though these tracks may be serious in content and delivery-- ""Frank, AB"" even nods to the titular mining town's deadly 1903 landslide-- they are buoyed by majestic arrangements. All 13 songs on Hometowns are built on a foundation of quirky synthesizers and sober acoustic guitars, but the drums (which are front-and-center in the mix on so many of these songs) sprint with breathless insistence on ""Four Night Rider"", some elegant strings add organic warmth to the skittering rhythmic intensity of ""Don't Haunt This Place"", and the glittery innocence of the acoustic arrangement adds whimsy to the earthy stomp of ""Rush Apart"". The band's theme song, ""The Ballad of the RAA"", combines all these elements for a thumping gem of rich, mournful cello, hopeful glockenspiels, bittersweet synths and even a surprising a cappella moment. The lyrics are the plainspoken, wistful longing for the details of small-town life on the prairie. With odes to the night sky as seen from a particular part of Alberta or descriptions of an old apartment, Edenloff mourns for relationships and homes lost or gives voice to the uncertainty one feels when moving on from people or places. Given his reedy tones and preoccupation with the past, it would be easy to compare RAA to Neutral Milk Hotel (the death-haunted lyrics of horn-studded ""Luciana"" make it the track most easily confused for a lost Jeff Mangum opus). But with more intensely vigorous drumming, more obviously personal lyrics, and a more blatant interest in glossy electro-pop, Edenloff's band carves out their own niche. It is one that masterfully blends the masculine and the feminine, the refined and the coarse, the dark and the bright. Hometowns ends with ""In the Summertime"", a solemn ballad (the lone true ballad of the whole collection) of droning organs and heartbeat drum thumps that's one part Postal Service synthesized sentimentality, one part final-merry-go-round-ride-of-the-summer calliope melody. In barely two and a half minutes the trio evokes the serenading cicadas and sticky skin of uncertain but excited young lovers. ""In your summer dress, I was holding you, but you were holding less/ It's not the words, it's the ones you stress/ I love you is I love you, just don't love me less"", sings Edenloff, proving why the Rural Alberta Advantage were known as the best unsigned band in Canada before Saddle Creek snapped them up and re-released this debut. And it's a good thing they did; songs this good deserve to be heard by audiences as large as their sonic scope.","This affecting debut-- an underground hit for months, now out on Saddle Creek-- blends acoustic,Â nostalgicÂ rock, energetic rhythms, and grand arrangements.

Music From the Atom Smashers,Kate Simko,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a0ea9e61561daa4f4a/1:1/w_160/6a31f99c.jpg,2009-07-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13137-music-from-the-atom-smashers/,Ghostly,"Great science is full of intuitive leaps, but the producers of The Atom Smashers, a documentary about physicists at Fermilab, employed a strictly rational approach for the soundtrack: They sought out an electronic musician who already works in evanescent particles and focused beams. It doesn't downplay Kate Simko's considerable talents to say that she was born to make this score, although perhaps you could say that of any techno producer as steeped in ambient and modernist music as she. Music From the Atom Smashers simply gives her a template on which to do what she does: one that nudges her away from crisp dancefloor fare like ""She Said"", toward the mysterious realms of Steve Reich, Wolfgang Voigt, and Brian Eno. In fact, almost half of the album expires before we hear the first real house track, ""God Particle"". This is the particle for which the physicists are searching, and appropriately, the song seethes on the verge of an epiphany, with a melodic feeling of anticipation and bass so elastic it seems to be trying to mutter a revelation. Only ""Sociber"", an intestinal tunnel with drums that whiz and ping, similarly threatens to move your body. On most of the album, Simko is instead more interested in moving your space-time continuum. It would be tautological to call this ""pattern music,"" but it's certainly pattern-conscious. Outside of the dance tracks and the anomalous but excellent ""The Creative Part"", a Philip Glass-indebted composition for burnished ostinatos and piano sunbursts, Simko works in layered pulses, like sheâs breaking billiards racks in slow motion. She makes you feel the weave, not the line. A number of recurring motifs betray the record's soundtrack status: skittering palpitations, sifting shards of broken china, cosmic slide-whistles, shamanistic rattles, and striated rumbles roughing up bloops, snaps, crackles, and pops. A lot of Rice Krispies, to be sure, but Simko remembers to cut in plenty of fruit: warm blurs of melodica on the splintering dirge ""Quiet Daydream"", lingering symphonic chords on ""Nature Surreal"". More interesting than the sounds themselves are the intelligence and sensitivity of their deployment, the constant attention to weight, color, and direction. You never get the feeling that Simko cued up a few devices, hit record, and kicked back with a crossword puzzle. She hovers over the album, alert and meticulous, fitting a bass line with anti-gravity boots here, skewing the angle of a comet's tail there. As a result, the repetitive nature of the sounds subsides from your attention, as you marvel about how they penetrate sonic spaces you couldn't perceive until they were filled.","Rising Chicago DJ and house producer here also displays a considerable talent for creating experimental electronic music.

These Four Walls,We Were Promised Jetpacks,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49f5e6ef959693208f7/1:1/w_160/f78eb0fc.jpg,2009-07-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13136-these-four-walls/,Fat Cat,"This debut by FatCat's latest Scottish discovery, We Were Promised Jetpacks, is exactly what you'd expect from the label that gave us the Twilight Sad and Frightened Rabbit: an anthemic collection of heavily accented singing, insistent rhythms, and intense sincerity. But just because it's not surprising doesn't mean it's not appealing. With songs that marry tough riffs to tender glockenspiels and find a balance between muscular, masculine drumming and singer Adam Thompsonâs vulnerable, striving warble, there is much to like within These Four Walls. Discovered by the label thanks to Frightened Rabbit's MySpace page, We Were Promised Jetpacks are destined for comparison to that band of brothers. It's not just that their accents sound the same-- though, Americans take note, the Jetpacks are from Edinburgh and the Rabbits from Glasgow. Both bands traffic in rousing, emotive guitar pop driven by thundering drumming, though Frightened Rabbit come at it from an acoustic angle and are obsessed with the heaviness of the kick drum, while WWPJ come from a post-punk place where every 4/4 rhythm is punctuated with cymbal 16th notes. And Scotland must really be chilly because both bands are preoccupied with maintaining heat. FR, on their last album, admitted that ""it takes more than fucking someone to keep yourself warm,"" a theme that appeared on more than just the track called ""Keep Yourself Warm"". While, coincidentally, WWPJ's best song is ""Keeping Warm"", a more-than-eight-minute track that spends half of its run time as an instrumental-- spackling glockenspiels, guitars, and what sounds like a saxophone over its increasingly galloping rhythm-- and the other lamenting the loneliness of life. Perhaps there is something about a thick Scottish accent that allows us to indulge in grandiose emotional sentiments. If an American band gave us a track like ""It's Thunder and It's Lightening"", with its earnestly soaring melody that explodes out from an insistent strum, it would come off as gratingly emo. But swaddled in glottal stops and guttural consonants, the dramatic changes in dynamic feel earned and the sensitive lyrics feel roguishly honest. Maybe that's also due to the hugeness of WWPJ's drum sound-- maybe it's easier to be sincere without sounding like a pussy when backed by such rumbling, macho percussion? Though ""Quiet Little Voices"" feels a bit like Bloc Party with a brogue, thanks to the clinical skitter of its cymbal-heavy attack, ""Short Bursts"", which sounds like it was recorded in an echo-y cave, is fast and messy with all of its other elements racing to keep up with its tribal pounding. Because the intensity of their rhythmic assault can become tiring, We Were Promised Jetpacks smartly break things up with songs such as the spacey, drumless instrumental interlude ""A Half-Built House"" and the hushed, finger-picked album closer ""An Almighty Thud"" (though some of the more introspective tracks, like ""This Is My House, This Is My Home"", are a little too soppily ""Grey's Anatomy""-ready). But their best songs are still the barnburners. While they can teeter on the verge of being too angsty or overindulgent-- a fault not aided by Thompson's penchant for repeating one dramatic line over and over again-- We Were Promised Jetpacks were built for speed. And thanks to the taut grooves of a tight rhythm section, they sound better the faster they play. They don't have the lyrical complexity of the bands that they will be compared to (from a young U2 to the aforementioned Frightened Rabbit), but they do have the energy and that's a promising place to start.","This debut by FatCat's latest Scottish discovery is exactly what you'd expect from the label that gave us the Twilight Sad and Frightened Rabbit.

American Central Dust,Son Volt,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f7b1335d7bf1698ab4/1:1/w_160/34e27df5.jpg,2009-07-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13214-american-central-dust/,Rounder,"In the late 1980s, the members of Uncle Tupelo were checking out the entire country and folk sections from their local library and passing them around like bootlegs, which exposed them to many of the artists and styles that would inform their sound. A few of the records they cite as inspirations-- including 1975's High Atmosphere: Ballads and Banjo Tunes from Virginia and North Carolina-- were compiled and released on Rounder Records, which at one time specialized more in old acts than new. It's not especially surprising that Son Volt, Jay Farrar's post-Tupelo band, have finally signed with the venerable label, placing them alongside acts as diverse as Nanci Griffith, Rhonda Vincent, and Farrar's hero Woody Guthrie. That might sound like a circle finally completed if Farrar sounded today as galvanized as he did 20 years ago. Son Volt's label debut, American Central Dust, is some of the sleepiest protest music ever made: Every song saunters by at a slow tempo, Farrar's voice sounds increasingly inexpressive, and John Agnello's production makes everything sound real purdy but lifeless. Of course Farrar is never going to rock out again-- and the muddy electric guitars on the 25-mph ""When the Wheels Don't Move"" doesn't count-- but this folksier sound he has settled into during this decade rarely works up a sweat or even rouses you from a light doze. His deep, commanding voice-- perhaps one of the most imitated sounds of the alt-country movement-- has mellowed considerably over the years, such that at times he sounds a little wooden and disengaged. Occasionally he'll hit a high note (""Roll On"") or sustain a syllable into a strange vocal buzz (""Down to the Wire""),  but he can't sell his sympathy for Keith Richards on ""Cocaine and Ashes"" or work up much bluster on ""Pushed Too Far"". Lyrically, these songs prove slightly more straightforward and coherent than much of his '00s output, but even this directness sounds like an effort. On ""Sultana"", about the steamboat that exploded near Memphis in 1865, he approaches the history lessons with dry matter-of-factness and clunky phrasing that's made all the more egregious by the absence of details or point. ""The worst American disaster on water,"" he sings. ""The Titanic of the cold Mississippi was the Sultana."" For the most part, however, Farrar's subject matter is much more contemporary. As always, he's concerned with social injustice, corporate manipulation, job loss, the little guy vs. the fat cats, but in recent years his lyrics have tended toward the poetical and cryptic, dulling the sharp edges of his outrage. Perhaps it all goes back to those Rounder comps: As he has aged, Farrar has grown increasingly reverent toward his source material, learning his entire moral code-- at least the one expressed in his music-- from the singers of coal-mining and union songs. They are undeniably great and knowledgeable teachers, yet his faith in them has become not simply unshakable, but unexamined and unquestioned. His outrage once took instrumental form-- in the roar of guitars and the boom of that voice-- but now the music feels safe and deferential. Dissent can sound quiet or twangy or even laidback, but it should never sound so compulsory.","The Rounder debut of Jay Farrar's long-running project contains some of the sleepiest protest music ever made.

Wu-Tang Chamber Music,Wu-Tang Clan,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51aea9e61561daa5067/1:1/w_160/18353dc7.jpeg,2009-07-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13242-wu-tang-chamber-music-vol-1/,E1,"First things first: Wu-Tang Chamber Music is not a Wu-Tang Clan album, despite the presence of that W logo on the cover. About half the verses on the album come not from Wu members but from fellow Carhartt-era rap vets like Sean Price and Cormega. I guess Old 90s Rap Dudes Chamber Music didn't have the same ring. There's no Method Man, no GZA. RZA doesn't produce any beats, though we do hear his voice over and over. Second: Wu-Tang Chamber Music is only barely an album. Of the 17 tracks on the CD, only eight are actual songs; the rest are strictly interstitial pieces, kung-fu movie samples, or bits of marble-mouthed mythology already familiar to anyone who read The Wu-Tang Manual. And make no mistake: People who read The Wu-Tang Manual are definitely the target audience here. The mere existence of this LP has a weird late-90s quality to it; it's a throwback to the time when record-store shelves were crammed with with albums by vaguely Wu-affiliated crews like Killarmy and Sunz of Man, when labels would rush out any old crap they could slap that W logo on. A decade on, it's oddly comforting that a label would aim for your Wu-Tang consumer dollar even when that dollar barely exists anymore. But if Wu-Tang Chamber Music is a hackneyed cash-grab, it's a pretty good hackneyed cash grab. Because once you get past the brevity and the non-Wuness of it all, there is some beautifully executed hardhead grown-folks rap shit on here. The music comes from the Brooklyn soul band the Revelations, who do live-band rap music as well as just about anyone, which is to say that you can't tell you're hearing a live band most of the time. There's an organic old-soul crackle to the incendiary trumpet-bursts on ""Sound the Horns"" or the slow-rolling bassline on ""Ill Figures"", but that warmth is the sort of warmth that the better East Coast producers can get out of old records. And so credit might be due to Fizzy Womack, otherwise known as M.O.P.'s Lil Fame, probably the best beatmaker currently working the underground NYC circuit. Fizzy co-produced every actual song on the album, and these tracks have a hard-hitting simplicity that probably serves a quickie all-posse album like this one better than RZA's choked paranoia would. And because the Revelations play music even during the interludes, those bits never fuck up the flow of the album. And it certainly helps that most of the craggy veterans here, Wu and otherwise, go in hard on this thing. Most of these songs don't have actual choruses, so gnarled shit-talk is the focus here, and the assembled old gods still do it well. On ""Ill Figures"", Kool G Rap does twisted-up, lispy, half-off-beat gun-talk so well that you'd probably guess he'd been doing it for decades even if you didn't know. Inspectah Deck, on ""Sound the Horns"", comes with easily one of the top five C. Thomas Howell name-checks I've ever heard on a rap song: ""The sound of the horns says it's on / We storm through like C. Thomas, Red Dawn."" (""P. Swayze"" would've fit in just as well there, but Deck never goes the obvious route.) Cormega remains one of the only rappers who can get away with a line about ""lyrical elevation causes mental stimulation"" because he throws that in the middle of a verse so jammed with internal rhymes and left turns (""this is a lyrical aqueduct""?) that you only barely notice. Even RZA, never a great rapper, comes with at least one hot line: ""My moms put gunpowder inside my Similac."" And in his three appearances here, Ghostface Killah maintains his status as Wu-Tang's MVP, ranting about the shrooms on his tour rider on ""Harbor Masters"" or kicking unbelievably badass warnings on ""Evil Deeds"": ""Don't ever come at me sideways, hands in ya pocket/ Cuz I will turn to Steven Seagal, rip ya arm out ya socket."" But Ghostface's highlight, and the album's, comes on ""I Wish You Were Here"", the one moment of tenderness in the midst of all those boxcutter threats. Over a slow, quavery soul-jam beat, Ghost bleats out one of those emotive sex-rap verses that he does better than anyone else before ceding the spotlight to a raspy old-school soul clinic from singer Tre Williams, who comes off like Gerald Alston on 8 Diagrams' ""Stick Me for My Riches"". So, OK, the various rappers here can lay on the get-off-my-lawn stuff a little thick. (Topics railed against include Hot 97's Summer Jam, skinny jeans, Twitter, and the ever-popular ""ringtone rappers"".) And there's really no compelling reason for this LP to exist beyond these guys' desire to remind us that they're alive. But I haven't heard an album full of anachronistic tough-guy stuff this satisfying in a long time. The world may have moved on to songs with the word ""swag"" in the title, but these guys are still out there, spitting grown-man gangsterisms to anyone who will listen. I call that nobility.","Only tangentially Wu-related, this brief, new collectionÂ is a hackneyed cash-grab, sure, but it's a pretty good hackneyed cash grab.

Wait for Me,Moby,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51e5e6ef95969320a1a/1:1/w_160/2b7ae41f.jpg,2009-07-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13245-wait-for-me/,Mute,"One of the nice things about being a decade past your commercial (and arguably artistic) peak is that you can discover what turns on your true fans. The post-rave cultural context that made his 1999 recordÂ Play a worldwide smash feels more distant than ever, but Moby has yet to stop reliably cranking out a new LP every few years. (Wait For Me is actually his second in the last two.) This consistency makes you assume that somebody's still anticipating the latest post-chill out communique from the world of Richard Melville Hall. His U.S. sales may have slipped from multi-platinum to gold to satisfactory, but that just means Moby's able to provide his core listenership with exactly what they want. Coming so soon after Last Night-- the 2008 ""return"" to high-energy electronic dance from an artist who's never been fully committed to either fast tempos or pure disco-- Wait For Me is more in line with the soft-focus alt-rock of 2005's Hotel, itself taking off from the singer-songwritery side of Play and 18, with blessedly fewer turns from the man himself at the mic. Perhaps he realized his shoegaze-lite stabs at semi-pop songwriting are better suited to wispy lady vocals than his own everyvegan monotone mumble, because there are plenty of tracks on Wait For Me that feature generic, feathery coos. Wait For Me shuffles through two decades' worth of records from the sections of Moby's collection marked ""easy-listening indie rock"" and ""easy-listening dance music"": bedroom-friendly sorta-techno that's like a low-fat version of prog house's voluptuous synths (""Walk With Me"") and portentous string arrangements (""Division""); vaguely post-punk influenced songwriting, like Joy Division with all the menace and weight scraped away until nothing but a vague, twangy ennui remains (""Mistake""); instrumental miniatures like Satie shoved into 90s ambient dress (""JLTF 1""); and ethereal textures out the wazoo. (And of course, being a post-Play Moby album, the prerequisite breakbeat-plus-bluesy-African-American-sample track, ""Study War"".) It's all very beautiful in places, but the kind of beauty that's next to impossible to dredge from your memory even a few minutes after track 16 winds down. Again and again, Wait For Me offers some truly gorgeous sounds-- the guy who worked wonders with the ""Twin Peaks"" theme all those years ago hasn't lost his way with a shivery snatch of pseudo-melody-- with very little bothering to tie them together into anything like songs, unless unwavering stoner-tempo beat counts. Wait For Me is an exceptionally pleasant album, which is in no way intended to be sarcastic. It just never strives to be anything more than prettified soundtrack-in-waiting stuff, lacking the memorable-on-the-first-listen hooks (M83) or over the top grandeur (Sigur RÃ³s) of other acts who've explored similar sounds in the last 10 years. And even as ambient, or new age nostalgia, it lacks the textural richness that inspires listeners to repeatedly dive into such seemingly ""static"" discographies as Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. For those outside the Moby cult, Wait For Me is background music in the purest sense, an album of mood-buoying sketches best suited to provide color to otherwise bland scenes (working, studying, waiting on the phone with the cable company, getting your hair did, etc.) from your daily life. It's too listenable overall to be outright dismissed as some sort of flop. But it's too willfully unobtrusive and happy with its lack of ambition to try and sell as good pop, even in a year thin on the mediocre kind.","Moby continues to explore gorgeous melodies, hereÂ shuffling through two decades' worth of easy-listening indie rock and easy-listening dance.

Royal City,Royal City,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49bea9e61561daa4f3f/1:1/w_160/c7dbaa3d.jpg,2009-07-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13132-royal-city/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Funerals are for the living, not for the dead, but the years covered by Royal City's farewell odds and sods compilation, 1999â2004, reminds us of the stressful, joyful, creative lives of many young bands. That time period spans an inexact period of my life-- likely yours as well-- but holds plenty of importance for the members of the Guelph, Ontario, country-rockers Royal City. It covers the lifetime of a band that, along with the Constantines, helped spark an uptick in early 2000s Canadian indie in Guelph and Toronto. Royal City have the profile of a pressurized, scene-making band of ruffians: fervent collaborators, singer Aaron Riches was a prominent figure in Guelph's punk scene, while Jim Guthrie was an already established singer/guitarist. But the band's records, including 2001 pinnacle Alone at the Microphone, showcase a band whose finest quality was restraint. Royal City songs shuffle along, augmented by slight country signifiers, by Guthrie's exacting guitar curls and Riches' modest poetry. So the cover of Iggy Pop's tongue-in-cheek ""Here Comes Success"" that begins Royal City-- as well as the animal howls of ""In the Autumn"", the harder-edged version of Alone opener ""Bad Luck""-- represent a figurative letting down of hair for young men who'd always acted beyond their age. A handful of tracks here suggest Royal City had more to give: ""Postcards"" is a slyly clanging, imagistic epic, the type of statement song their albums often lacked.Â ""O You With Your Skirt"" is flirty and engaged, its reserved lust the perfect soundtrack to your next afternoon spent sundress-gazing.Â ""A Belly Was Made for Wine"" recalls Uncle Tupelo in its tight melodic phrasing; ""Dog Song"" is sweet and literal (""He's a very very very nice dog/Even though he barks""). Royal City doesn't imply progression, though: its tracks are not sequenced chronologically (in fact, it's not close: the compilation is bookended by the only two tracks recorded in 2001, for example), and the highlights listed above are scattered through the band's six years. So the proceeding is not one of mourning what might've been but simply pleasant recollection. If you're a fan, it will allow you to mostly forgive the undercooked acoustic demos (""Can't You Hear Me Calling"", ""I Called But You Were Sleeping"") or retreads (an early version of ""Bad Luck"" offers little insight and no improvement) and revel in details like the kazoo solo during ""Here Comes Success"" (ushered in: ""Here comes kazooooo!""), the self-referential chorus of ""In the Autumn"" (""C-I-T-Y/ Royal city""), and the band's sleepytime cover of the Strokes' ""Is This It"". For a band of Royal City's profile, as scene-makers, as brief collaborators with artists like Feist and Owen Pallett (Final Fantasy), as a young band that started local (on Guelph-based Three Gut Records) and found believers (their final two albums landed on Rough Trade, and Royal City arrives in gorgeous, bound packaging from Asthmatic Kitty), this set lacks a little bit of fire. But it remains pretty true to Royal City's reputation as talented, smart artists who, probably deservedly, remained on the periphery of the Canadian indie rock explosion.","A rarities collection from the inclusive Ontario outfit showcases a band whose finest quality was restraint.

The chugging, scrappy, Velvets-indebted aesthetic is so finely woven into ""classic"" indie rock's DNA (thanks largely to 90s uber-fans like Pavement and Superchunk), that it's easy to take a new album from one of the key Kiwi bands for granted-- even to write it off as quaint and anachronistic. So inevitably, nostalgia nags The Guilty Office, the Bats'Â first release since 2005'sÂ At the National Grid, theirÂ respectable but underwhelming return from a decade-long hiatus. Despite introducing a few upgrades over the years-- actual sound engineering, a greater vocal role for guitarist Kaye Woodard, and the occasional harp-- the band hasn't tinkered with its signature chiming guitars and surging straight-ahead rhythms. But why fix a formula that works? From melodic, bobbing leadÂ ""Countersign""Â to bucolic closerÂ ""The Orchard"", Office is a comfortable, comforting listen, wonderful in its very familiarity. Even as the band sticks to the path of least resistance, it skirts the MOR sandtrap that sinks so many indie rock acts that manage to last a quarter century. The Bats'Â feet aren't as fleet as they used to be; nothing on Office hurtles with the reckless abandon of classics ""United Airways"" or ""The Law of Things"", and there's a higher ratio of slow-to-fast tempoed songs than there used to be. But a tune likeÂ ""Crimson Enemy""Â locks into enthusiastic, even danceable grooves. And although lead Bat Robert Scott has always harbored a hint of despair in his almost-comic frog-throated croak, he's positively ebullient dueting with Woodard onÂ ""Steppin'Â Out"". Even on less-sunny songs like the title track orÂ ""Broken Path"", the dude sounds like he's smiling, like he's (get this!) happy to be there. The record's midsection is a tad soft and somewhat skippable. I'm a sucker for a good ending, though, and orchestra-enhancedÂ ""The Orchard""Â is a knock-out, as pretty and plush as a middle-period Belle and Sebastian track, with a unison-sung chorus that suggests the whole room, including the sound guys, are chiming in onÂ ""here we go a-wassailing around the apple trees again."" Charmingly giddy as that is, you actually have to return to track one,Â ""Countersign"", for the album's essential lyric:Â ""We want you back here/ You've been too long away."" Agreed.","The Kiwi band has come back all the way on this, its first release since 2005's underwhelming return from a decade-long hiatus,Â At the National Grid.

Not only was stic.man a major inspiration and vocal contributor to the far-superior The Nigger Mixtape, but upon hearing Untitled's witless failure at cross-breeding N.W.A. and P.E., it wasn't hard to think, ""didn't Dead Prez'sÂ Let's Get Free do this way better?"" Indeed, that was Let's Get Free's entire M.O., and near-misses rarely come more fascinatingly or glaringly flawed-- just listen to early run of ""I'm An African"", ""âThey' Schools"", and ""Hip-Hop"" and you'll be ready to forgive ""Mind Sex"". Maybe. It's not like there's ever a bad time for Dead Prez to return to the scene, but with their own DJ Lantern-helmed mixtape, a lack of any label constraints, and white people in power fucking up even more than usual, 2009 just feels like the right time for a reintroduction. But ""Don't Hate My Grind"" featuring Bun Bâ¦I mean, ""Hip-Hop"" initially tricked you into thinking that these guys might have been a Dirty South act at the get-go, but is that what they've actually grown into? Sort of. Turns out Young Jeezy was on to something with The Recession, employing a Obama-derived power of positivty within an easily understood, catch-all framework in which concerns of the everyday street hustle can be addressed. ""My grind's my stimulus plan,"" M-1 spits at the end of ""The $timulus Plan"" and it functions as something of a thesis for Pulse of the People-- ""grind"" gets employed with a frequency that rivals Let's Get Free's use of the word ""exploit*.*"" That's not as much of a 180 as it sounds, since ideals of self-reliance andÂ communityÂ empowerment have always been a part of the Dead Prez ethos. Pulse follows suit, dealing less with dubious conspiracy theorizing and Molotov recipes and instead painting characters with broader strokes-- the young, erudite revolutionary-in-training (""Runnin' Wild""), the ethically admirable street soldier (""Gangsta, Gangster""), the anti-authoritarian (""Warpath""). As with their previous work, it can be difficult to figure out whether to evaluate the message independent of the actual music. It's a thankless task to find fault with a song that endorses donating to clothing drives and mentoring the young, but ""Helpful"" doesn't offer much beyond PSA, being the rare point on Pulse where Dead Prez's unfortunate love for sickly neo-soul hooks manifests itself. ""Afrika Hot!"" welds surf-guitar to a get-buck, native tongue chant in the most sonically exciting track, but otherwise, DJ Lantern collects a gaggle of beats all generically synthy and bass-heavy enough to delude itself into Hot 97 rotation; ""Refuse to Lose"" masters the obvious with its sample and I keep on waiting Ron Browz to show up at some point in ""Gangsta, Gangster"".Â Exponentially more difficult to explain is ""My Dirty Valentine"", a hair-pulling, ass-slapping, freek'n you sex jam that's could only be more out of character if it featured Vampire Weekend.

But then again, you almost miss how their earlier work left it up to the listener to determine whether Dead Prez were looking to educate or entertain when they advocated robbing pizza deliverymen or the idea that the only thing that made them angrier than white people are white people bumping ""Hip-Hop"" and ignoring, say, ""Police State"". Pulse of the People finds a pleasant middle ground between those two posts, but listening to Big Apple big-ups like ""NYPD"", I just hope that Dead Prez aren't expecting to find soldiers for their revolution in the XXL Bangers comments section.","Hip-hop (no pun) vets return with a DJ Green Lantern-helmed mixtape, advocating forÂ self-reliance and community empowerment by painting in broad strokes.

Fits,White Denim,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48bc0084474cd0c04f5/1:1/w_160/67d2c04d.jpg,2009-07-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13119-fits/,Full Time Hobby,"My base-level reaction to White Denim-- a trio who have seemingly never met neither a tempo they can't shift out of at a second's notice nor a branch of psychedelia they can't pluck from-- is a sense of jitteriness and slight unease, which could be what they're aiming toward. Yet once I start to gain a real feel for the band, I don't get the sense, as I do with many of their contemporaries, that they're merely reverent pastiche artists. Oh, there's plenty about their latest album Fits that pulls from the past-- the blistering fury of Love's ""7 and 7 Is"" is an obvious touchstone; the Doors' lusty freak-bliss pops up often. But at the same time, the band's choice of name and its aesthetic penchant for surface-level representation makes me think that, far from flipping through back issues of Creem for inspiration, they situate themselves in a nostalgia-for-the-present feedback loop. Still, the first thing listeners will notice about White Denim is the way they switch sounds so abruptly: In openerÂ ""Radio Milk How Can You Stand It"", the first two-thirds of the song is standard White Denim-- bass that sounds like it's reverberating from underground, percussion that chatters like wind-up plastic teeth, James Petralli's squawk mirrored by chippy, dirty guitars.Â Then after a millisecond pause, drums lock with guitar, a skronky sax appears, and Petralli's register shifts to a bluesy howl. The song, still satisfying and surprising on the 10th listen as on the first, could have been drawn from the catalog of any number of psych-based power trios, but it's executed well and makes for a great opener.Â More often, however, Fits featuresÂ hippie paeans likeÂ ""Mirrored and Reverse"", bearing a wispy semi-refrain that suggests the Byrds' Fifth Dimension, without bringing much more to the table than atmosphere. For all the moments Fits locks in and finds a groove strong enough to hang a hook on, it more often slides right past, on some sort of restless vision quest for something it's bound not to find.Â First singleÂ ""I Start to Run""Â sounds like the Red Hot Chili Peppers circa Mother's Milk (there, I said it), and if they want to grind out propulsive, gonzo funk pastiche that's okay with me.Â It's when the group hints at something bigger and grander without manifesting something out of their ambitions, like on the album's last two songs, ""Regina Holding Hands""Â andÂ ""Syncn"", that I stop paying attention and instead start anticipating their next EP.Â ""Regina""Â dispenses with any timbre resemblingÂ ""honk""Â orÂ ""slap,""Â substituting strummy acoustic guitar and a bluesy wail.Â ""Syncn""Â ends the record on an even breezier note, Petralli's vocals holding in a creaky upper register that makes him sound like Devendra Banhart. Incendiary live shows, sure, but White Denim are a product of the Internet, first and foremost.Â And their path has taken the sort of weird turns that one might expect for a band seeking to distinguish itself in a virtual market where seemingly everything's already been done.Â Their first EP was promising, to say the least, and since then they've released two very similar ""follow-ups"", Exposion and Workout Holiday, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, which folded those songs in with a bunch of others that failed to pack as much of a punch.Â And so Fits feels like the band's formal first LP-- lots of what makes them unique, and then those somewhat awkward ""growth"" points.Â That initial itchiness, in other words, never really goes away.","Still displaying more promise than power, White Denim are thankfully able to slowly grow under the dim, fleeting spotlight of the Internet music world.

Reckoning [Deluxe Edition],R.E.M.,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4999d034d5c69bf30e8/1:1/w_160/64c83d89.jpg,2009-07-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13130-reckoning-deluxe-edition/,InterscopeA&MIRS,"Given their vast and varied catalog, it's sometimes easier to imagine R.E.M. as a discography than to picture them as a flesh-and-blood band. Ironically, it may be R.E.M.'s insistence upon operating as a fully democratic entity that has allowed them to shapeshift so completely and convincingly. Whether crafting a subdued folk song or an over-the-top glam rock stomper, R.E.M. have always embraced their chosen approach completely, even if it means former drummer Bill Berry laying low for an acoustic number or singer Michael Stipe handing off a lead vocal to bassist Mike Mills. On their sophomore LP,Â Reckoning, those polymorphous tendencies find root as palpable, electrifying, yet-unexplored potential. And with this aptly named reissue, Reckoning finally gets the ""Deluxe"" treatment (and much-needed remaster) that it deserves. This comes as no surprise; the ""Deluxe"" reissue of the band's debut full-length,Â Murmur, was revelatory, breathing astonishing new life into a 25-five-year-old album.Â Greg Calbi's expert remastering job cleaned up the album's notoriously murky sonics and revealed previously unheard detail and force.Â  This newfound clarity madeÂ Murmur seem much more purposeful, lifting the proverbial veil on an album made by record nerds who understood the common ground between the Soft Boys, Gang of Four, and the Velvet Underground. Reckoning couples the energy of Murmur with the experience of a group that has spent a few years touring and recording, documenting that crucial moment when a band's ideas and ambitions are overtaken by the unique chemistry of its players. Finally, with this remaster, ""Harborcoat"" makes for a fittingly explosive opener. Many of the best songs on Reckoning follow the formula set forth on this debut track: a methodical verse followed by a sly turnaround into a cathartic chorus. Bill Berry's drum parts are at times virtually indistinguishable from song to song, and Michael Stipe tends to sing verses and choruses in the same respective registers. But Reckoning is far from formulaic-- instead, it is host to a kind of determined minimalism, each song building via subtle variations in performance and instrumentation. ""Discipline"" is not a word that gets thrown around a lot when discussing rock music, but it is key to Reckoning's success. Case in point: As with countless songs written before and after it, ""So. Central Rain"" takes up the simple phrase ""I'm sorry"" as its chorus. But the combination of Stipe's strong-yet-unmistakably-fragile voice, Berry's nervous drumming, and the melodic interplay of Mills' bass and Peter Buck's guitar imbue these well-worn words with remarkable force and meaning. For all the arty, pretentious gestures the band was given to, Reckoning shows that they were not afraid to embrace the universal, to transfigure clichÃ©s rather than ham-fistedly avoiding them (see also ""Everybody Hurts""). As with its predecessor, Reckoning finds R.E.M. touching upon different styles while working within a fairly consistent aesthetic. The latter half veers a bit towards Americana, without sacrificing any of the momentum built over the album's stunning opening tracks. Slight embellishments go a long way towards highlighting the band's versatility-- a propulsive piano line in ""(Don't Go Back to) Rockville"" elevates the homespun whimsy of Stipe's voice, and hand percussion on ""Time After Time (Annelise)"" hints at the more understated turn the band would take with Fables of the Reconstruction. The live disc included in this reissue (a 1984 performance at Chicago's Aragon Ballroom) demonstrates how well these songs work without any such production flourishes. While the raw energy of the live show included in the Murmur reissue is toned down a bit, it is fascinating to hear the band grow more sure-footed in both performance and arrangements. It is also interesting to hear how the band's live approach seems to have been absorbed back into their studio recordings; Stipe's trademark live vocal tics are present throughout Reckoning. Declaring Reckoning to be R.E.M.'s ""best"" album sells short just how many different kinds of great albums R.E.M. have released. But, more so than any other R.E.M. record, Reckoning is unified and energized by the very restlessness that has driven the band to explore so many different ideas and identities. It is this paradoxical engine of transparency and mystery that has made the band so unique, regardless of the particular approach they choose to take for a given record. Any way you look at it, this is R.E.M.","The expanded reissues of albums from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. years continue, as the brilliant follow-up to Murmur is augmented with a 1984 live show.

UUVVWWZ,UUVVWWZ,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52113d1975652138e92/1:1/w_160/ddd9d527.jpeg,2009-07-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13250-uuvvwwz/,Saddle Creek,"First, let's get something out of the way: Even if you instinctively recoil in horror just thinking of another band with two consecutive Vs in their name, UUVVWWZ is definitely not the worst band name you've ever encountered. Aside from the fact that the group insists on pronouncing it ""Double 'U' Double 'V' Double 'W'...'Z'"" rather than the more intuitive and percussive ""You You Vee Vee Double-You Double-You Zee,"" it is actually a pretty cool name, at least in the sense that it gives few hints of what to expect from the music. In a field overcrowded with horrendous band names running the gamut from the deliberately obnoxious (Battlehooch) to the painfully pretentious (the Spiritual Machine), UUVVWWZ's moniker does not immediately indicate the musicians' worst impulses, and it has a welcome ring of enigmatic eccentricity. Even if it is needlessly difficult to pronounce, the name invites the listener to figure it out, and wonder what the band is all about. So yes, the big question: What is UUVVWWZ all about? Judging by the sound of their debut album, it seems as though they are still working that out. They certainly have an aesthetic in mind: Loose yet tense, arty yet accessible, epic but not ponderous. The nine songs on the record happen to be the group's first nine completed compositions, and so while many of the tracks have the thrilling buzz of inspiration and discovery, it is also apparent that they're casting about in search of an identity. This is not to say that the songs lack character. The band's best asset is Teal Gardner, a singer blessed with a strong, distinct voice that's compelling even when it comes too close to emulating other vocalists. This is most evident on the album's spazzy rockers, which have the manic chirpiness of Deerhoof and Ponytail, but also the more populist tunefulness of early Yeah Yeah Yeahs. ""Jap Dad"" is the best of these songs, but as much as that number is charmingly bratty, it comes off more like the band are having a good time than being entirely themselves. The quieter tracks on the record feel much more natural and relaxed. The opener, ""Berry Can"", shifts between a sweet, girlish vocal from Gardner and a dark, menacing riff that breaks into the song like an unexpected thunderstorm on an otherwise sunny afternoon. ""NeolaÃ±o"" and ""The Sun"" flirt with outright bluesiness, which encourages Gardner to play up the more bold and womanly aspects of her voice. ""Castle"", the album's centerpiece and best song, falls perfectly at the center of the group's aesthetic spectrum. As the music floats between moments of dreaminess, turbulence, and catharsis, Gardner's performance is similarly mercurial. For the most part, her emoting matches the sound of the band, but her inflections and cadences are often surprising and vaguely counter-intuitive. She is a revelation on this track, seamlessly transitioning between fragility and intensity, and investing her entirely inscrutable lyrics with a convincing urgency. The band would be wise to continue on the path laid out by this song. Clearly, this is Gardner at her most confident and affecting, but it's also the band's most dynamic moment, and allows them to move between a lovely, unapologetically pretty groove and an appealing heaviness. There are plenty of signs that UUVVWWZ are on track to become a better band, but ""Castle"" is the song that will make you impatient for them to hurry up and get to their next level right away.","Nebraska band may still be figuring out what it wants to be, but the best moments here show promise.

Under and Under / The Fields EP,Blank Dogs,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42bea9e61561daa4e3e/1:1/w_160/74d9e969.jpg,2009-07-01 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13040-under-and-under-the-fields-ep/,In the Red,"Blank Dogs make the familiar unfamiliar. For instance, we have seen these elaborate PR tactics before: one man posing, at least in name, as a band, but with studiously guarded anonymity. But the web unearthed a name and pieced together a back-story, and Mike Sniper has been outed as the mastermind behind the project. A walking Wikipedia of music arcana, he played guitar in the New Jersey punk outfit D.C. Snipers, hawks rarities at the Academy Annex record shop in Williamsburg, hand-crafts gig posters and t-shirts, and set up both the power-pop-reissue label Radio Heartbeat and, more recently, the Captured Tracks imprint. His art has colonized every corner of his life. For anyone tempted to paint Sniper as a bandwagon-jumper, chasing some kind of hipper-than-thou low fidelity trend, one glance at this CV would straighten them out. Mysterious, minimalist, alive to antecedents, Sniper's way of advertising himself mirrors his way of expressing himself. Again, there's a faint illusion of laziness. But it's the appearance of a narrow palette and recycled template-- the jog tempo, meekly mechanized drums, tin and treble, voices a room or two down the hallway-- that hides a more complicated reality. As Sniper himself told The Fader: ""I have these visions sometimes of writing songs that sound like Jeff Lynne or the Move, but it still comes out sounding like some blown out Factory Records demo."" But Under and Under dispatches the charge of repetition and ""samey"" songcraft very quickly. Track two, ""L Machine"", flies far off course, continents away from Robert Smith's private property, to land somewhere in Cabaret Voltaire's jungled, more treacherous terrain. While the simplicity of the album opener is preserved-- the guitar's three notes are taken over by the keyboard-- a crude, anxious vision of the future emerges. Howls of electronic static, hissing and beeping like signals intercepted by satellites, vie not only with a spirited acoustic strum, but explosions of broken glass. The startling blend suggests a close encounter of the third kind, followed by a sloshed bonfire. Another brilliant departure comes late in the record, in the aptly named ""Slowing Down"": the song decelerates from Under and Under's usual cruising speed, without sacrificing the project's love of disorder. Even at slower tempos, he pairs echoing guitars with slashing sounds and a chaotic hook, perhaps a decayed ode to decayed love. Weighed against the well-received On Two Sides, released by Troubleman Limited, Blank Dogs' second full-length is more colorfully composed, without straying too far from Brooklyn's increasingly popular ragged-reverb aesthetic. Admirers of Crystal Stilts and Vivian Girls, in particular, will already have a soft spot for Sniper's particular flavor of pop deconstruction. (As of 2008, you can even call them labelmates: the recent Blank Dogs EP The Fields was released by Jeremy Earl's Woodsist Records.) Where Vivian Girls sand their sharp, discordant edges with harmonies, and where Crystal Stilts shower rain over sun-kissed 1960s pop, Sniper veers off in a different direction. There's a temptation to slander these family resemblances as hipster herd thinking; given the obvious sense of community across labels like In the Red, HoZac, Art Fag, of like-spirited musicians collaborating and ideas cross-pollinating, the truth is brighter. The emotions, of course, are darker. In Under and Under, especially, today connects to yesterday through Sniper's abiding love for the overcast moods of post-punk and the gloomier regions of new wave. The struggle to squeeze Blank Dogs into a genre is important to his project-- maybe not to the artist, but certainly to the listener: meaning can be found in each hint of music history, real or imagined. Post-punk's memorial to blighted industry is fittingly evoked here. The Blank Dogs aesthetic, and that of the larger low-fi movement, gracefully soundtracks our moment, as a kind of comment on technology's rising tide capsizing all boats. ""Setting Fire to Your House"" captures the present malaise, expertly pitched between menace and innocence. Like Sniper's earlier ""Leaving the Light On"", the song sinks a charismatic chorus into an enveloping melancholy. It is worth comparing his treated voice to a more famous manipulator. About T-Pain's reliance on Auto-Tune, The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones noted: ""His vocal hooks sound delirious, not desperate."" By shrouding or drowning-- the goth atmosphere demands morbid verbs-- his voice in reverb and distortion, Sniper aligns himself firmly on the side of desperation. The giddy delirium, on the other hand, is the province of the keyboards, which have the whiny timbre of a children's toy, or a campy Theremin, in the moan and sigh of solitary notes. Chords would have been too delightfully unified to capture recession-era fragment and isolation. New wave, which came to describe the groomed and well-behaved child of punk, is no less relevant: Sniper makes use of the style's bittersweet melodies, but muddies them to oblivion, pulling them back closer to the raw emotional punch of punk. The patina of fuzz brings to mind garage rock and gauzy shoegaze (or is that fuzz really Psychedelic Fur?), while others spot goth, all suggesting amped-up arrangements of manic-depressive lyrics. Sure enough, Sniper captures the translucent train-through-fog chug of the Jesus and Mary Chain (""The New Things""), the garbled gloom of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry (""Open Shut""), and the space-age detachment of Soft Cell's Mutant Moments EP. But how can one man call to mind so many styles without sinking into incoherence? The key lies in the tunes' blurry shapelessness, the sense that we're apprehending something through squinted eyes or a Vaseline-splotched lens, and that a kind of Rorschach-blot logic of projecting and imagining takes over. Just don't ask what that something is.","Two releases from the proprietor of the lo-fi Captured Tracks imprint touch on goth, garage rock, and shoegaze.

Street Sweeper Social Club,Street Sweeper Social Club,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5175e6ef95969320a09/1:1/w_160/aae4b0cd.jpg,2009-07-01 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13239-street-sweeper-social-club/,Warner Bros.,"The Coup's Boots Riley and Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello seem more likely to meet on a political talk show than on record, but the pairing has a precedent: Morello added his hiccuping, dying-engine electric guitar sounds to ""Captain Sterling's Little Problem"", from the Coup's 2006 album, Pick a Bigger Weapon, and his distinctive, but unobtrusive contribution somehow worked (even if Boots Riley's affected accent on the same track didn't). Here, on Street Sweeper Social Club's self-titled debut, the ball's shifted more into Morello's court, with funky, though fairly minimal rap-rock. Granted, this album falls into a formula that's instantly recognizable the moment you hear it, for which Morello deserves credit; but with Street Sweeper Social Club, Morello is part of a backing band (and, in pulling double-duty on bass for the record, is most of the backing band), ready for an assertive, engaging personality to take them to the next level. Enter Boots Riley. On paper, he should be perfect for this: Over his long career as a rapper, there's always been a relatable everyman attitude and a warm generosity behind every political platitude. He might be the world's most lovable self-proclaimed communist. But the man is not himself on this record. ""The Oath"" begins with a surprisingly mellow, bluesy intro where Boots shows off his eye for detail (a broken TV bolted to the wall, a lacquered and carved-up tabletop), but it just leads to more staccato blues riffing and vague fight lyrics with a dog of a chorus. Too often, these songs have direct counterparts to old Coup songs that leave them in the dust. He's singing, ""Fight, Smash, Win,"" as three easy steps to resolution, where just three years ago he was singing, ""Laugh, love, fuck, and drink liquor,"" (from Pick a Bigger Weapon's ""Laugh/Love/Fuck"") to achieve the very same thing: Did he think rock kids couldn't relate? Rather than treating the album as an opportunity to find a new audience, Riley writes as if he needs to dumb it down for a different crowd. Some songs take brief respites from the distinctive formula Morello helped to build, from the aforementioned breakdowns in ""The Oath"" to the strummy opening chords of ""Good Morning, Mrs. Smith"" or the more fluid unaccompanied bass lines of ""Somewhere in the World It's Midnight"". Any and all changeups are welcome, and Riley takes those opportunities to ably switch up his flow. But whether they're riding their comfort zones or pushing themselves, the problem isn't style so much as substance. These are rock anthems, not dissertations; but in keeping things vague and general rather than Riley's normally pointed and specific raps, they rarely approach any kind of relevancy. There are a few exceptions, notably ""Shock You Again"", but as a portrait of a soldier ordered to torture, it falls short of indicting any specific person (or method, given the title), and the less said about the lantern-jawed soldier's accent Riley adopts here the better. Even as a record of adequate, vaguely politicized mook-rock, it mostly falls flat, whether by lazy lyrics or some uninspired drumming from Galactic's Stanton Moore, who adds plenty of percussive touches like the judicious cowbell of ""Clap For the Killers"" but sinks more straightforward tracks such as ""The Oath"" like a stone. The touring band already has a new drummer, plus a full-time bassist and rhythm guitarist in place; perhaps the debut can be written off as a rehearsal before everyone involved can contribute their all.","Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello teams with another agit-pop star, Boots Riley of the Coup, for a record of, you guessed it, political rap-rock.

Dillanthology 1: Dilla's Productions for Various Artists / Dillanthology 2: Dilla's Remixes for Various Artists,J Dilla,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4cfb1335d7bf1698a54/1:1/w_160/94a46de7.jpg,2009-07-01 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13183-dillanthology-1-dillas-productions-for-various-artists-dillanthology-2-dillas-remixes-for-various-artists/,Rapster,"As much of a following as James Yancey has garnered since he passed away, it's frequently said that he should have had that following from the start; the only thing that kept him from a certain level of hip-hop celebrity for many years was his tendency to stay behind the boards and avoid the spotlight. As Kelly Louise Carter noted in Vibe's article ""The Battle for J Dilla's Legacy,"" when A Tribe Called Quest's Beats, Rhymes and Life got nominated for a Grammy, Q-Tip practically had to badger him into even going to the award ceremony. By that time, Jay Dee had already put his signature on three of my favorite hip-hop tracks of the mid-1990s-- the Pharcyde's ""Runnin'"", De La Soul's ""Stakes Is High"", and Tribe's ""Stressed Out""-- but since he was still kind of an unknown quantity, I had no idea he'd had a hand in producing them. Even the encyclopedic Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists, published right before the 90s ended, doesn't mention him, unless you count two Ummah remixes listed under ""Q-Tip's Notable Non-A Tribe Called Quest Productions."" That would've been a great time to release something like the two volumes in the Dillanthology series-- when he had a rich enough body of work to justify them, but still had the kind of relative anonymity that would make it revelatory. Instead, what we get with these two compilations-- one volume of original productions, one of Dilla-orchestrated remixes-- is a selection of damn good songs, and not enough of them. By now you know the usual pitfalls with best-ofs: dedicated fans already have most of it, while neophytes still get an incomplete picture, and either group could just as well put together their own tailor-made and arguably better version of it through single-track downloads on iTunes. Throw in the fact that there's a pretty ridiculous surplus of unearthed and repurposed Dilla material lately (rumor has it one of his beats is going to be on the next Opeth record), and putting out a best-of in [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| 2009 is an undertaking that'll only lead to loose ends and missing pieces. Volume 1 is typical of that quandary, where pretty much everything is great but you're left wondering why there's only 13 tracks on a disc that has room for another 25 minutes' worth. So you get ""Runnin'"" and ""Stakes Is High"", but no ""Stressed Out""-- no Ummah-driven Tribe at all, actually, which could be due to the Best Of's eternal hitch of rights issues. At least there's still enough star power to exhibit how wide his reach was: the first seven tracks go Pharcyde-Slum Village-Common-Badu-De La-Busta-Roots, which covers nearly every important collaborator from 95 through 2000 and balances well between the iconic (Common's sing-along classic ""The Light"") and the left-field (""Show Me What You Got"", in which the world learned that Busta sounded ill over Stereolab loops). A few later-period cuts like the heat-sizzle synth throb of A.G.'s ""Hip Hop Quotable"" and Steve Spacek's borderline-avant-garde soul-drone single ""Dollar"" round things out, but it's still the Cliff's Notes version of a sprawling career: here's the classic stuff where he did soul-jazz beats with immaculate drums and beautiful, pulsing bass, now here's a couple of his grimier/stranger early-mid-aughts stuff, now sort it all out. If you really want to get some illumination, the remix-centered Volume 2 is more essential by dint of this stuff being less familiar and often harder to find. By sticking mostly to Jay Dee's work through 2000 it feels more declamatory of a specific style: almost entirely late-90s/Ummah-era, where he had his work cut out for him revamping big hits but still found a way to lend his signature style to contexts where it really shone. Much of it consists of solid alternate takes of stuff he'd already produced (including a more heavy-funk take on ""Stakes Is High"" with new verses from Mos Def and Truth Enola), but there's other nuggets like the unreleased remixes of Masta Ace's ""Sittin' on Chrome"" and the Artifacts' ""The Ultimate"" that make this volume essential. The latter-period stuff shines, too, especially the 2003 remix of Four Tet's ""As Serious as Your Life"" (featuring a super-bugged-out watery guitar loop and verses from Guilty Simpson) and a hazy 2004 mutation of Brother Jack McDuff's ""Oblighetto"" that turns his organ-driven ""Scenario"" source into a netherwordly ether frolic.

If it's your first experience with Jamaican music (tsk, tsk), the variety on hand here should help dispel the myth that dancehall or any other Jamaican sound is monosyllabic. (If you need further proof, Soul Jazz's Dynamite! series is a great place for the uninitiated to start...try 200% and 300% first.) But if you're bugging out over the whole authenticity thing for some reason, Diplo and Switch have lined up a who's-who of Jamaican vocalists: Vybz Kartel, T.O.K., Ms. Thing, Turbulence, Mr. Vegas, Mr. Lexx, and more. Wisely though, they still know their probable audience (i.e. hipsters) and kick this off withÂ ""Hold the Line"", a song featuring Santigold. (the CD case calls the songÂ ""I'll Make Ya"", but some discs have been printed with a sticker letting us know the [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| song is indeed calledÂ ""Hold the Line"", as already indicated from mp3 tags, MySpace streams, and its music video.) Whatever you want to call it, with its rumbling bass,Â ""A Milli""-like vocal hook, and spaghetti western atmospherics, it's a hell of a way to kick off the solid-to-killer six-song stretch that opens the album. Well paced and immaculately produced, the first half-dozen Guns songs nicely move between the past 30 years of Jamaican music, from the sweetÂ ""Can't Stop Now""Â [ft. Mr. Vegas and Jovi Rockwell], which recalls the rocksteady-indebted, pre-digital sounds of 80s dancehall, to the politically chargedÂ ""Anything Goes"" [ft. Turbulence], steeped in modern ragga and the give-and-take between the island's music and American hip-hop, particularly that from the post-Cash Money South. The record derails in the middle, and no points for guessing where based on the tracklisting.Â ""Mary Jane""Â is the requisite weed song, and sadly it's played off as a sniggering novelty, making it both obvious and annoying. (Major Lazer do humor much better later, taking the Baby T-Pain meme and turning it into a clever skit.) There's also a song featuring Amanda Blank,Â ""What U Like"", that's of course a minimalist electro track full of boilerplate sex talk. (Einstein asks the appropriately named Blank if she likes it when badman fucks her, etc.; Blank says yes, actually, I do.) The rest of the back of the album, despite not having the awesome ebb and flow of the first half, features some of its heaviest hitters: Vybz Kartel and T.O.K. (with a return appearance by Ms. Thing) show up and kill onÂ ""Pon de Floor""Â and the Man Parrish-samplingÂ ""Bruk Out"", respectively. And closerÂ ""Jump Up"", with co-production from Crookers (ofÂ ""Day 'N' Nite""Â remix fame) would be the perfect au courant dancefloor filler if it weren't for the record's weird trojan horse:Â ""Keep It Goin'Â Louder""Â [ft. Nina Sky and Ricky Blaze]. So, yeah, buried deep into Diplo and Switch's dancehall record, they went and hid one of the best pop songs of the year. Let's not declare death of Auto-Tune quite yet-- if this thing could get a foothold on the Hot 97s and B96s across the country it would deservedly shoot up the charts. With about three ridiculous hooks,Â ""Louder""Â serves as a nice calling card for Diplo and Switch as crossover producers and a reminder that Nina Sky are weirdly underutilized. Five years after teaming with M.I.A. for the Piracy Funds Terrorism mix and making his excursions to favela funk balls in Brazil, Diplo seems oddly underespected these days. Perhaps it's because he's a better DJ and producer than remixer-- and in the immediate aftermath of his rise to fame, it was a remixer that he got his most work. Perhaps it's because to either those who want pop/youth culture to be somehow segregated-- or to those who believe they've graduated from collegiate suburban solipsism into something more open-eared and less purely straight and white, yet still remain suspicious of other white kids who also enjoy disco/hip-hop/dancehall/pop-- he's an easy go-to negative representation of young white urbanites and their encroaching interest in global black culture (which, historically, is the definition of hipsterdom right there). Whatever the case, he and Switch are kicking off summer with an armful of perfect cookout-, top down-ready songs, like the daytime soundtrack equivalent of all of the summertime night's rooftop music that's been coming from Swedes Air France and the Tough Alliance and their new wave of American indie disciples, such as Real Estate and Memory Cassette in the past year-plus. Best to enjoy it now, even though it will still also sound great in six months.","Diplo and Switch recruit vocalists such as Santigold, the women of Nina Sky, Vybz Kartel, and more for an eclectic dancehall-heavy party record.

Super Animal Brothers III,EAR PWR,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a478c0084474cd0c04c6/1:1/w_160/a65ede62.jpg,2009-06-30 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13104-super-animal-brothers-iii/,Carpark,"Plenty of bands falter when their ambition outstrips their ability, but for Baltimore's EAR PWR, the problem is exactly the opposite. It's hard to get mad at the fun, shallow Super Animal Brothers III, unless you're the sort of person who's infuriated by neon sunglasses and haphazard leotard combinations on principle, in which case, prepare to get heated. It feels like they'd do better if they dropped the postures and affectations that dilute the album and instead focused on fleshing out their songs, which are sown with the seeds of good ideas. From the first sounds you hear-- a pestering alarm and a soupy, panning bass tone-- you know what sort of album it's going to be: puffy-paint party jams Ã  la Dan Deacon, with lots of pixilated analog synth streams, glitchy drum matrices, and faux-kiddy singing about video games, sparkly sweaters, and, I don't know, manatees? You get the impression you aren't really supposed to pay attention to the lyrics. But where Deacon infuses his day-glo riots with brainy intent, EAR PWR recycle the worst tendencies of electroclash: the lackluster rapping and willful inanity. It's frustrating because there's ample evidence that EAR PWR aren't compensating for being shitty at music, they're just dumbing down. Devin Booze studied in UNC-Asheville's music technology program (founded by Bob Moog), where he learned to build the devices used in EAR PWR's music, and he's quite clever at fitting deranged textures around locomotive rhythms. His sequences are lively, squiggling like chiptune, sashaying like Italo-disco, and singing out like new wave. He makes a synthesizer whiz around like a punctured helium balloon on ""Diamonds Liquor Leather"", fashions a kind of demented Irish reel on ""Secret Stars"", and employs glockenspiels and deformed Boyz II Men samples on ""Boys II Volcanoes"". He likes to cut off his loops at the ankles to create a feeling of choppy, precarious progression rather than fluidity, and this air of haste evokes the album as a whole-- a handful of cool loops welded together doesn't automatically make a memorable song. Similarly, Sarah Reynolds can sing a nice hook when she cares to. The choruses of ""Future Eyes"" and the title track are earworms; Reynolds could do more with this Belinda Carlisle-meets-M.I.A. shtick. But it's never very long before she's back to stringing together nursery chants, snatches of unmoored melody, general sassy noises, and rudimentary rapping, and the songs dissolve into a mush of mannerisms. Honestly, the deck is stacked against EAR PWR as a recording entity-- their music, focusing on thrill-per-second immediacy and communal ecstasy, is designed for warehouse parties full of sympathetic friends who find your bad rapping cute. Here, they could take a lesson from Deacon: Live, let the id rage, but let your brain do the heavy-lifting when it comes time to make something for those who couldn't make it to the party.","Homemade electronics. Baltimore. Day-glo analog synths. Glitchy drum machine. Childlike singing. You guessed it: this sounds like Dan Deacon.

"...At the Moment of Our Most Needing or If Only They Could Turn Around, They Would Know They Weren't Alone",Rock Plaza Central,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a479c0084474cd0c04ca/1:1/w_160/a025785b.jpg,2009-06-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13105-at-the-moment-of-our-most-needing-or-if-only-they-could-turn-around-they-would-know-they-werent-alone/,Paper Bag,"Not to knock his vocals, but Chris Eaton is more storyteller than singer. He's published two novels, including aÂ ""cover""Â of Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blues Eyes, and his band Rock Plaza Central's third full-length, Are We Not Horses?, was an odd concept album about mechanical equines who develop their own horsey self-awareness. Even singing, he remains a narrator-- not simply because he's relating connected events, but more crucially because the inflections and expressive accents in his performances suggest a man caterwauling in character. As a songwriter, he creates full mythologies like a Joss Whedon unburdened by the strictures of television, and as a singer, he gives his fantastical characters voice, but it's his band that makes those worlds seem real and relatable. On Horses, they gave his valedictories and conspiracies a soft, elegiac edge, and on their fourth and equally majestic album, they find new ways to illustrate his tales. Despite that long album title (and what's wrong with such a wordy title?), there is no overarching narrative quite as pronounced as the one that rode Horses. Eaton has said he was inspired by Faulkners'Â Light in August, but barely any trace of the novel appears in the music. There is a sense of a journey undertaken, battles fought, ideas considered, destinations reached. If that impressionistic tack means At the Moment lacks the full conceptual thrust of its predecessor, it nevertheless feels somewhat more approachable, as if you could put it on shuffle and proceed through this strange world logically. Of course, Rock Plaza Central are no Decemberists: Accessibility is not necessarily their aim, nor is winking literary approximation. With no need to sell their erudition, they are free to rock more freely. So openerÂ ""Oh I Can""Â rises like a zombie out of the silence, with a lumbering tom rhythm, a lurching bassline, and cinematic strings all building into a full chorus. By the end of the song, the band is harmonizing behind Eaton's testifying:Â ""I could give down and cry,""Â he sings,Â ""but I won't give down and cry.""Â It's a strong lyrical and vocal hook, but as At the Moment unfolds, it focuses more intently on the music than on Eaton's lyrics, as if only through Blake Howard's galloping drums (his sudden entrance onÂ ""[The World Is] Good Enough""Â is one of the album's most energizing moments) and those mournful horns could they ever convey this story. These songs mark a slightly different direction for the band: They're using pretty much the same arsenal of instruments that colored Are We Not Horses?, but they're deploying them in different ways to make different sounds and play different roles. There's a classic-rock vibe on most of these songs, but especially onÂ ""Holy Rider""Â andÂ ""(Don't You Believe the Words of) Handsome Men"", where banjo, violin, and horns execute the pyrotechnics typically reserved for electric guitar. The result is a heavier, denser, ponderous sound that makes At the Moment no mere sequel, but its own sovereign entity. Contrasting these rock songs are quieter tracks likeÂ ""O Lord, How Many Are My Foes?"", which sets Eaton's wartime prayer against minimal accompaniment. A lone trumpet plays an ascending scale like it's ushering his words to God's ears, but a small, curious, arrhythmic percussion (unidentifiable, but it sounds like a pair of woodblocks) keep him tethered to the earth. InstrumentalsÂ ""Country C""Â andÂ ""The Long Dead March""Â further the plot gracefully, and while some classic rock-oriented bands might release guitar albums, At the Moment is perhaps a violin album. Fiona Stewart, who doubles on trombone, switches between lead and rhythm parts fluidly, playing the main riff onÂ ""Holy Rider"", adding a windswept backdrop toÂ ""(The World Is) Good Enough"", and sympathetically shadowing Eaton's vocals onÂ ""Handsome Men"". ""We all love like battalions, we all love with abandon,""Â Eaton sings onÂ ""We Are Full of Light (That Blinds Us at the Moment of Our Most Needing)"", as Howard beats out a Dodos-style rhythm. It could be the closer, but it's not-- just more rising action. Rock Plaza Central have a strange destination and a denouement in mind, and the band makes the story sound like it's set in the real world with unbelievably real stakes.","Latest album from the ambitious band takes an impressionistic tack, relying less on an overarching concept.

Depart From Me,Cage,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a566ea9e61561daa5120/1:1/w_160/2eccee1c.jpg,2009-06-30 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13309-depart-from-me/,Definitive Jux,"Hey, what's this-- an extended wallow in self-pity and self-loathing from a pissy, drug-addicted white rapper who can't stop reliving his terrible childhood? And all of it sounds like a painfully dated dispatch from the era of Insane Clown Posse and Marilyn Manson? That Slim Shady: did he buy Cage's tape and dub over it again? It's a real shame that Cage's latest, Depart From Me, turned out the way it did. His last record, 2005's Hell's Winter, was a harrowing example of emo-rap, a record that transformed the well-rehearsed details of Cage's traumatic life-- violent and heroin-addicted father, abusive stepfather, a history of drug problems and a tortured stint in a mental institution-- into a compelling showcase for the other thing he shares with Eminem: prodigious rapping abilities and a gift for rendering nightmarish scenarios, like the one in which police rip heroin bricks from the floorboards of Cage's home while his father brandishes a gun at him and his mother, with uncomfortably vivid detail. Hell's Winter veered off-course only when Cage indulged his unfortunate weakness for Linkin Park-style emo, like ""Shoot Frank"", which features a mewling nu-metal hook courtesy Glassjaw lead singer Daryl Palumbo. Sadly, Depart From Me seems to have taken ""Shoot Frank"" as a way forward rather than a dead end, in the process reinforcing the lamentably accurate stereotype of rappers with terrible taste in rock music. Worse, Cage seems to have bottomed out psychologically again, flipping us off with his deliberate lack of effort: ""I have nothing left to say, I'd like to share it with you/ If you don't care, is it too bad for me or too bad for you?"" goes the chorus to ""Nothing Left to Say"", the first song on the album. Lyrically, he's still ""cling[ing] to [his] addiction like a kid in swimmies,"" which is fine; if Clipse can spend a career detailing their addiction to pushing dope, Cage can certainly devote as many albums as he wants to his addiction to doing it, but, as Malice and Pusha T are finding out, if you're going to rap about the same thing over and over again, you better damn well be finding new and better ways to say it. And just as there only so many puns you can build around the words ""ki's,"" ""birds,"" and ""snow,"" Cage is running up against the fact that he's already obsessively detailed this stuff-- his addiction, his deadbeat dad-- with more fervor and invention than he ever musters here. ""Beat Kids"" is an almost-complete retread of Hell's Winter's ""Stripes"", right down to the scenes of his wild-eyed, terrified mother. And as far as drug rhymes go, ""silly habit, drugs are for kids,"" just ain't cutting it. It might help if Cage spent more than half the album rapping, but mostly, he is trying to make his version of an early-80s hardcore album here, shades of Suicidal Tendencies, Circle Jerks, and Rollins-era Black Flag. His success rate roughly equals that of Andre 3000, trying to make Idlewild OutKast's period-blues album. The NOFX-ishly titled ""Fat Kids Need an Anthem"" sees Cage doing his best impression of Mike Muir's aggrieved-loser narrator on Suicidal Tendencies' ""Institutionalized"", and the song, a frank and refreshingly funny take on his fluctuating weight and self-image problems, is one of the album's few fleeting moments of real wit: ""They say you are what you eat, that means I went from shit to a vegetable! And the worst part about it is, I was happier when I was fat on drugs! I went fantasizing about women to fantasizing about food I can't eat anymore!"" But then the song's chorus-- ""I WAS A FAT GUUUUUUY! I WAS A BIG, FAT GUUUY!"" leaves something to be desired even by the loose standards of 80s punk. There are one or two moments where Cage manages to bridge the gap between miserable-underground-rapper guy and miserable-suburban-punk-rock guy, and they come when Cage focuses on the kind of small stuff that makes 80s hardcore winning-- girls, mostly, and obnoxious friends asking for too many plus ones at his shows. ""Captain Bumout"", about wanting the club to empty out so you can talk to that one girl, boasts the album's only great, anthemic chorus. But for every one of those, there are three songs like the title track, where Cage spends four minutes throwing withering insults at a girl who dared to leave him when he suffered a mental breakdown. (Clincher line: ""You ruined art for me."" Classy.) Like the other white rapper he will never escape comparisons to, Cage exhausts the patience of even his faithful followers at times, and Depart From Me almost reads like a plea to whoever might be left checking for him in 2009.","Cage follows 2005's Hell's Winter, a harrowing emo-rap record, with an extended wallow in self-pity and self-loathing.

Octahedron,The Mars Volta,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a565c0084474cd0c06e8/1:1/w_160/b4976128.jpg,2009-06-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13308-octahedron/,Warner Bros.,"Look, here's the deal: If you don't know what you're getting into with a new Mars Volta record at this point, after seven years and five albums (plus one EP and a live thing or two), then my advice is to go directly to full-length numero uno, 2003's De-Loused in the Comatorium. Sample its rhythmic-centric, post-emo art-rock, and decide if you need to continue through the band's catalog. It only gets less user-friendly from there. Because (speaking to the first-time listeners) ""rhythm-centric"" here doesn't mean anything remotely funky.Â It means the frantic, percussion-heavy, multiple-tempo-shifts-per-song brand of complexity inaugurated by batshit 70s-era theatrical hard rock.Â Also, the band's allegiance to jazz-fusion titans, ones not averse to fuzz and a low-end, means things get far...looser from album number two onward. Arena-grade heavy metal thunder abruptly melts into a groovily aimless journey for congas and electric organ. Repeatedly.Â ImmodestlyÂ virtuosicÂ and never afraid to run with a jam, the Mars Volta's ability to alienate newcomers is well-documented. Which means this review is probably for those not already-- or instantly, after their first listen-- alienated. Is Octahedron the band's best album? No, but if you dig on MV's unrepentantly ""big"" and meandering suite-driven concept-album thing, you won't necessarily be disappointed. And with songs that only once stray past the eight-minute mark, it's the most accessible MV album since the first. Slower, with fewer breakdowns or out-of-nowhere segues into a wholly new song, it's kind of a Cliffs Notes of everything the band does well, ditching much of the attention-straining stuff. For instance, the hallucinogen-friendly stretches, where glassily effected guitars ping and peal at lava-lamp tempo, have been pruned. (Okay, with a few exceptions.) Even the longest songs stick to something like a coherent mood and linear structure. Sometimes they even straight-up rock. ""Cotopaxi"" is perhaps the tersest, most jagged song Omar Rodriguez-LÃ³pez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala have cut since At the Drive-In imploded, a boogie riff nodding to their Texan origins, violently cut up and reassembled with virtuoso care. ""Desperate Graves"" actually builds, rather than dropping a big loud bomb after a placid bit of introductory strumming, and comes with the closest thing the band's written to an instantly memorable chorus in quite a while. Even the breakdown is short and to the point. This being the Mars Volta, however, it wouldn't do for the album to be entirely curveball-free. For instance, Autechre-style electronic hisses and bristling beats bubble up in the latter half off ""Copernicus"", mostly without getting all show-offy about it. There's also the general slow and steady downtempo-- or plain downer-- feel to many of the songs. For a band so often pilloried for being too agitated to ride out a good riff, it's probably the closest the Mars Volta will ever come to a cop for the slow jam kids. And it's hard to deny that, depending on your taste for jamming, if you've ever dug on acid-spitting wank-solos over endless, thunderous drum rolls, the final minutes of album closer ""Luciforms"" is pretty much the shit from a shameless climax standpoint. As for Bixler-Zavala's lyrics, well, sure, they still often verge on the eye-rolling if you're not going to meet him halfway. I'm not going to pretend that a line like, ""My devil makes me dream/ Like no other mortal dreams"" comes off to me as anything but camp/kitsch. And ""don't stop dragging the lake"" (from ""Cotopaxi"") isn't really an earworm as far as hooks go. Now I don't mean to dismiss the words' possible import. It's been clear from album one that the lyrics have a deep resonance for the band, and are meant as clues for the kind of fanbase who enjoys treating records as narratives with big gaps waiting to be filled with a little online research/interview legwork/guesswork. While I'm so not that guy, I will just say the melodrama-rich, scrambled poetry-notebook puzzle pieces do ""work"" in the context of the album's overall sound.Â So does the horror flick sound of Bixler-Zavala's vocals. When his full-tilt shriek joins the band at a moment of total commotion, you can imagine the planetarium-scale mock grandeur of it all. The Mars Volta feeds some very specific needs in its fanbase. There's a certain kind of listener that, maybe once a year or maybe every day, wants music that sates the same impulse that makes people gorge on spectacle-scale cinema or devour the entire Dune series in a few weeks. The Mars Volta's specific brand of bombast may remain an untranslatable language for those rooted in a DIY-scaled world, or committed to the shiny three-minutes-and-change tidiness of the charts. But if you're fiending for the musical equivalent of an epic, partially incoherent battle between good and evil in IMAX 3D, you could do a lot worse.","The ambitiously huge prog-rock band return with their most relatively accessible album in years.

Music of the Modern White,Zs,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4965e6ef959693208df/1:1/w_160/2f6c8bf5.jpg,2009-06-29 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13128-music-of-the-modern-white/,Social Registry,"The last time I saw the Brooklyn band Zs, they sat on the stage quietly, clustered around their sheet music like bees, hunched, and then erupted in a sound that could've frightened cement. This was late 2007-- not long after the release of their full-length debut, Arms, a pornographically strict hash of avant-garde classical music, free jazz, and punk. More than noisy, Arms was violent. Like good boxers, Zs sensed that timing, precision, and angle meant at least as much as power. I'd heard Lightning Bolt hit harder. And Don Caballero. But Zs-- they were blinding. I buckled. When I'd interviewed now-former guitarist Charlie Looker earlier that year, he'd promised me they were loosening up. I was skeptical. Under that spotlight in south Brooklyn, they focused so intensely on their scores I think they dented their music stands. Eventually, they did loosen. A little. Hard, a 15-minute EP released in 2008, had moments that, in their own hyper-regimented ways, were funky. (Use this term responsibly-- Zs still have more in common with locusts and trash compactors than Parliament.) Saxophonist Sam Hillmer had previously played with a tone that could cut grease; on Hard, he added some fuzz and gristle. Guitarist Ben Greenberg started to devote some attention to his sound, not just his notes. Since Hard, the band has slimmed to a trio: Hillmer on sax, Greenberg on guitar, and Ian Antonio still on drums. Music of the Modern White isn't a loose album, but it's one that suggests a new set of concerns for them: Atmosphere, texture, sonics-- in short, the pats of music you can't notate. This is good: It drags them off the page and into the room, making the music sound more like dialogue. Most of the album's first half is howling, spectral noise. Textured, too. When Hillmer finally stumbles into the mix, his playing is expressive and unscripted-- more like a devotional than a calculation. The second half is quieter, breaking into a light, orderly pattern of handclaps and harmonics. It concludes with a meditative, droning wash so far removed from anything on Arms that it's hard not to smile: Zs got loose. But Music of the Modern White isn't drone, it isn't ambient, and it isn't easy. Even in repose, Zs are still a band probably best kept away from tinder and picnics. Still, it's transitional music for them. They're like birds trying to figure out how to be bears. What they're doing now might not play to their obvious strengths -- but they also might just be developing new strengths. Having seen what I've seen of them till now, I don't doubt that once they figure out what they want next, they'll grab it by the throat.","Brooklyn band's debut was an abrasive mix of avant-garde classical music, free jazz, and punk, but here they've loosened up, favoring atmosphere and texture.

So Far Gone,Drake,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5169d034d5c69bf31fd/1:1/w_160/1375a9b8.jpg,2009-06-29 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13238-so-far-gone/,self-released,"On the one hand, itâs heartening that something like this can still happen: Relative unknown creates mixtape with a few friends and uploads it to the Internet, and then, within a few months, heâs maybe/possibly dating Rihanna and fielding seven-figure offers from broke major labels. Except, in this case, the relative unknown in question was a star on the Canadian teeny-drama âDegrassi: The Next Generationâ, and the friends in question are Lil Wayne and Trey Songz and Chris Paul. Even weirder, the main overarching theme of Drakeâs So Far Gone seems to be the stresses and travails of fame, even if he recorded the damn thing when he wasnât famous in any meaningful way. And now the tape has made him good and famous for real. I donât know how this kind of thing happens; I just watch it. Drakeâs calling card has become âBest I Ever Hadâ, a likable, breezy summery pop song thatâs managed to ascend to Hot 97 omnipresence without any sort of label backing, a very serious achievement. Itâs a Nerf-heavy declaration of lust with a nice sentiment behind it, Drake telling the songâs second-person subject that sheâs prettiest with no makeup, that sheâs the fucking best lay he ever had. It also contains the one and only slick punchline Drake offers on the whole hour-plus mixtape: âWhen my album drops, bitchesâll buy it for the picture/And niggasâll buy it, too, and claim they got it for they sister.â See, Drakeâs not a great rapper. His delivery manages to convey confidence at pretty much all times, but itâs still halting and awkward. Half the time, his lines barely even make sense: âI never get attracted to fans/ Cuz an eager beaver could be the collapse of a damââhuh? And even if the tape is mostly crammed with emo soul-baring, he still comes up with lines like this: âMy delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man.â Ugh. In his four appearances on the tape, Lil Wayne just annihilates Drake. This wouldnât be news, except weâre talking about circa-2009 syrup-fried Wayne here, and itâs rarer and rarer that he gets the better of anyone on a song. And yet So Far Gone still scans as one of the most compulsively listenable mixtapes of a great year for mixtapes. Blame Kanye. Drake isnât just a post-Kanye artist; heâs a post-808s and Heartbreak artist, possibly the first. On that album, Kanye drifted lazily from rapping to singing over a bed of rippling lush-but-sparse electro that still gets better every time I hear it. Drake does much the same thing on So Far Gone. Heâs a singer/rapper in the Missy Elliott mode, and he even pays Missy tribute by swiping the beat from her âFriendly Skiesâ for âBriaâs Interludeâ. When he swings from rapping to buttery teen-idol singing, it feels organic and effortless, like heâs just doing whatever makes the most sense at any given moment. Musically, Drake favors a very specific sort of sugary but spacious electro-soul; nearly every track makes heavy use of organ sustain and sparse heartbeat drums. He uses tracks from Swede-pop types like Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John, the sort of thing that seems forced and gimmicky when most rappers do it. In Drakeâs hands, though, those songs make sense in close proximity to, say, Jay-Zâs âIgnorant Shitâ or Kanyeâs âSay You Willâ. And it helps that he actually interacts with his source material. With âLittle Bitâ, Drake doesnât simply rap over Lykke Liâs original. Instead, he structures it like a duet, he and Lykke slowly circling each other and admitting their crushed-out feelings. Itâs cute. My favorite track on the tape is the DJ Screw tribute âNovember 18thâ, wherein Drake pulls off something that Iâve never heard any actual Houstonians manage (sorry, Big Moe): He turns Screwâs slow, woozy sound into loverman R&B. The lyrical conceit is goofy as hell (âTonight Iâll just fuck you like weâre in Houstonââslow, get it?), but Drakeâs angelic falsetto floats beautifully over the smeared-streetlights track, and it just sounds right. And then thereâs all that price-of-fame stuff. Again, blame Kanye, because somehow this comes out sounding slippery and interesting rather than petulant and unbearable. See, Drakeâs figured out that the way to brag backhandedlyâto brag without braggingâis to complain about all the awesome shit that you get to endure. So here he is on âThe Calmâ: âLook what I became, tryna make a name/ All my first dates are interrupted by my fame.â Other rappers talk big about getting mobbed every time I hit the mall; Drake complains about those masses making his candlelit dinners a little bit more awkward. Or: âMy mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out, so I park about five houses down.â You learn he has a Phantom, and you also learn that itâs the source of some family strife that doesnât even make sense. Crafty. And now that Drake is really, truly famous, he should really have some shit to complain about.","Ex-""Degrassi"" star finds new levels of fame as a rapper via a mixtape complaining about his previous level of fame.

Magnificence in the Memory,YaHoWha 13,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a494b1335d7bf16989cd/1:1/w_160/7cf41ff2.jpg,2009-06-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13126-magnificence-in-the-memory/,Drag City,"There's so much easily-found information about 1970's spiritual group the Source Family, and its musical arm Yahowha13, that covering it all in a record review is both impossible and pointless. Suffice to say that this fascinating community, centered around the charismatic Father Yod and his vegetarian L.A. restaurant The Source, was really into rituals-- especially 3 a.m. meditations. These were sometimes followed by jam sessions, often because Yod simply said ""Let's play some music!"" The result: nine albums released under the YaHoWha13 name in the 70s, all reissued a decade ago as part of the stunning 13-disc set God and Hair (a set curated by Seeds founder Sky Saxon, a devoted Source member who recently passed away). But much more of the group's music-- a raw mix of psych, improv, and spoken-word-- was recorded by Source member Isis Aquarian. Magnificence in the Memory represents a small slice of her vast archive, known to insiders as ""The Lost Music"". The album came together when Source compatriot and No Neck Blues Band member Dave Nuss combed through some of Isis' tapes, settling on nine tracks totaling 40 minutes. Nuss intended Magnificence to flow like an album rather than a sampler, and his work paid off, as the record has a remarkably consistent vibe. How that vibe strikes you will depend on your tolerance for loose, meandering sounds, recorded with varying fidelity and overseen by a frontman who valued enthusiasm over convention or precision. For reference, the collective-based music of descendents like Sun City Girls, Bardo Pond, and Nuss's NNCK comes to mind. YaHoWha13's music sometimes sounds like rock, jazz, blues, even pop. But it's rarely anything you could call easy listening. Still, you might be surprised by how interesting Magnificence is considering its origin. The Source Family had a lot to say about life and how to live it, but in YaHoWha13, the music was the message. So rather than opening with loud proselytizing, Magnificence begins with Yod's slow whisper on the slinky ""Camp of the Gypsies"". Halfway through, he suddenly screams ""Let's Go!,"" and the band slams into raucous jamming. But even that sounds more like a cloudy seance than preachy gospel. When Yod howls ""I'm gonna lead you home, but not in the usual way!,"" it's hard to deny the second half of that lyric, even if you aren't sold on the first. The rest of Magnificence slyly dodges expectation. Wry humor dots ""Nam Yo Ho Renge Kyo"", whose anonymous intro is delivered in what sounds like Bugs Bunny's faux Asian accent. The clucking guitars of ""Treat You So Right"" bear an the odd logic akin to Captain Beefheart, while Yod's flute-like whistle on ""Sunshine Man"" creates an acid-soaked jingle. Sure, there are recognizable hippie moves here-- ""Fertility Dance"" is basically a drum circle, and ""It's a Knack"" is weirdo-folk in the vein of Syd Barrett or Skip Spence. But that doesn't diminish the warpy noise of ""It Doesn't Matter What You Do"" or the wind-and-drone duet of ""Father Whistling"". Even those tracks reflect the time period, but they still don't sound much like anything else made then or now. The uninitiated might wonder whether Magnificence is the best introduction to YaHoWha13, as opposed to God and Hair or individual album reissues. But the group was so devoted to Yod's vision that pretty much everything they did provides a portal into their sonic world. Magnficence in the Memory is simply a chance to enter new corners of the Source universe, and future releases-- whether archival or new (the band still tours, though Father Yod passed away in 1975)-- should offer more doors to YaHoWha13's unique perception.","A far-out comp culled from the unreleased archives of Father Yod's hippie L.A. religious sect by No Neck Blues Band member Dave Nuss.

Hot Buttered Soul,Isaac Hayes,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a510b1335d7bf1698aed/1:1/w_160/9a0a6935.jpg,2009-06-29 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13233-hot-buttered-soul/,Stax,"Think about how crazy this is for a moment: Stax loses Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays to a plane crash and the rights to their back catalog (and, later, Sam & Dave) to Atlantic. Without their biggest stars and their best session group, Stax executive Al Bell takes a desperate but necessary gamble: in an attempt to build an entirely new catalog out of scratch, he schedules dozens of all-new albums and singles to be recorded and released en masse over the course of a few months. And out of all of those records, the album that puts the label back on the map is a followup to a chart dud, recorded by a songwriter/producer who wasn't typically known for singing, where three of its four songs run over nine and a half minutes. And this album sells a million copies. If it weren't for the New York Mets, Isaac Hayes' Hot Buttered Soul would be the most unlikely comeback story of 1969. Since then, the album's had an odd reevaluation process: it hit #8 on the pop charts and #1 on the R&B charts, but also hit #1 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart-- which alarmed partisans of Miles Davis and Sly Stone alike. After another couple of albums in its crossover-friendly, string-drenched vein, Rolling Stone declared Isaac Hayes an enemy of all that was good about soul music in the early 1970s; decades later, a generation reared on hip-hop reverse-engineered the beats on Pac's ""Me Against the World"" or PE's ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" and discovered an original brilliance. Now, after a listen to this new reissue 40 years later, Hot Buttered Soul might still seem a little historically counterintuitive. It stood as a newer, funkier phase of Southern soul, but it hinged on a sound more opulent than the most sharp-suited Motown crossover bid. It's an exercise in melodrama and indulgence that lays it on so heavy it's impossible not to hear it as anything but the stone truth. And it's an album whose edited-down singles-- both of which went top 40 pop-- sounded more like trailers for the real thing. (Said single edits are included here and can be safely ignored.) Yet the success of Hot Buttered Soul owed a bit to a classic crossover formula: start with an easy-listening-friendly pop staple, keep the orchestral sweetness, but layer on a shining veneer of psychedelic R&B, then stretch it out with some soul-jazz vamping and nail it down with a voice that hits like a velvet sledgehammer. Hayes demanded full creative control for this album, and his auteurism resulted in a luxurious rawness that soul artists would scramble to catch up with for years. It wasn't exactly an unprecedented sound, however, and in its own extravagant way Hot Buttered Soul might be to the end of the 60s what Ray Charles' Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was seven years previous: an album that redrew the parameters for R&B's high-class populism. It's just that it hadn't been quite this audacious before-- not to the extent of Hayes' cover of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", all 18-plus sprawling minutes of it. Here we have a song that turns the idea of a slow build into something monumental: with a monologue he developed as a way to get apathetic club patrons to pay attention to where he was about to go, Hayes spends the first eight and a half minutes actually setting the stage for the scenario behind the song, from the wife's cavalier attitude and how the husband caught her cheating to the specific year and make of car he finally drove off for good in (a '65 Ford). It should be noted that all this time the band's been churning along with this hypnotic, minimalist swaying organ/bass/hi-hat drone that changes imperceptibly if at all; again, this is eight and a half minutes here. And when it finally does transition from Hayes' conversational murmur to the first actual sung line from the Jimmy Webb composition he's covering, it's the beginning of a metamorphosis that gradually transforms the dynamic of the song from sweet-stringed orchestration into full-fledged, brass-packed, explosively-cresting soul. But where ""Phoenix"" is all slow build, the album-opening version of ""Walk on By"" throws almost everything it has at you right away, nailing you to the floor with those first two drumbeats. Hayes takes the restrained sorrow of Bacharach and David's composition as made famous by Dionne Warwick and chucks it out the window, replacing it with an arrangement that is the absolute antithesis of hiding the tears and sadness and grieving in private. And it's goddamned devastating at every turn: its go-for-broke opening, with those weeping strings and that stinging guitar building to their gigantic crescendo; that moment when it collapses and sinks into Michael Toles' famous slinky guitar riff, which then warps its way into psychedelic keening more Hendrix than Cropper; every hitch and moan and heart-wracked ad-lib from Hayes' deep bass voice (""you put the hurt on me, you socked it to me, mama""). The entire last half of the song's twelve minutes is an exercise in seeing just how long you can not only maintain but build on a frenzied finale, where Toles' guitar sounds like it's ripping itself apart and Hayes' Hammond organ trembles and growls and stammers like a panicking tiger. It might be the most intense six minutes of soul recorded in the confines of a studio the entire decade. The remainder of Hot Buttered Soul isn't quite as ambitiously excessive, though the other two songs still have an indelible presence. Hayes' version of Charles Chalmers' and Sandra Rhodes' ""One Woman"" is affecting if short-- ""short"" in this case meaning a hair over five minutes. As breathers go, it works wonders in proving Hayes' way with a mellow ballad could still have an emotional impact in a more confined space. And Hayes' sole songwriting credit is the linguistically convoluted masterpiece ""Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic,"" a straight-up slick-as-hell funk jam which gets a lot of mileage out of humorously-deployed latin phrases and five-dollar words (""My gastronomical stupensity is really satisfied when you're loving me""). Even if it's his only lyrical contribution, he subsequently if unintentionally caricaturizes the ornate but down-to-earth personality of the entire album: it's all self-consciously complicated, but man, the meaning's right there in front of you. And it can't help but hit you right where you feel it.","A revolutionary classic of soul music, four string-drenched epics, is reissued 40 years on, in a package that includes bonus tracks.

Wilco (The Album),Wilco,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a515b1335d7bf1698afb/1:1/w_160/9f6f2f8e.jpg,2009-06-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13237-wilco-the-album/,Nonesuch,"At this point in Wilco's 15-year history, the band have been a lot of things, all of them sort of nebulous: alt-country, Americana, neo-folk, quasi-experimental, and, if you insist, ""dad rock."" Miraculously, the disparate strains within the group's catalog have somehow flowed together into a unifying aesthetic, largely due to Jeff Tweedy's distinctive singing voice and remarkable consistency as a songwriter. Though their previous releases, particularly the schizoid A Ghost Is Born, have embraced this eclecticism, the band's seventh proper LP, Wilco (The Album), does just what the title implies, and consolidates their style into a coherent statement of identity. This is something of a mixed blessing. Though Wilco (The Album) is a good, concise distillation of the band's strengths, it is not their best work, mainly because it lacks the audacity of their four previous efforts. The group's 2000s output thrived on Tweedy's restlessness and perversity, as if each song were penned in part to challenge the preconceptions of listeners eager to pigeonhole his work. The new songs sound like the work of an artist confident enough to step back from personal innovation in order to develop styles and themes already in his playbook. This yields some fine results, such as the flagrantly George Harrison-esque ""You Never Know"" and the amusingly self-aware ""Wilco (The Song)"", but the record is more comfortable than exciting or interesting. The more extreme elements of Wilco's style are present-- the sinister Krautrock of ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" resurfaces in the paranoid murder fantasy ""Bull Black Nova"" and the sort of delicately arranged instrumental passages that characterized Sky Blue Sky are evident in a more abbreviated form on ""One Wing"" and ""Country Disappeared""-- but these tics are toned down considerably, blending in seamlessly with simple, straightforward numbers such as ""Solitaire"", ""I'll Fight"", and the Feist duet ""You and I"". Every song on Wilco (The Album) is written and performed with immaculate precision, though the subtleties in the work gradually reveal their charms upon repeated listening. ""Deeper Down"" in particular is a marvel in the way its textures shift dramatically from verse to verse without diverting attention from the relative simplicity of its melody and rhythm. Similarly, the way the band effortlessly evokes waves of guilt, anxiety, and fearful resignation in ""Bull Black Nova"" is masterful and makes the song potentially painful to hear if you're already feeling any of those emotions. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are moments of unapologetic, unguarded beauty, as in the lovely lead guitar and piano parts in ""Country Disappeared"" and the melodramatic orchestral swell in the otherwise understated ""Everlasting Everything"". This is not the music of men trying to be cool; it is the work of veterans unafraid to express mature emotions with an appropriate level of musical depth and nuance. There is certainly more thrill to be found when the band is acting outÂ but there is something rather pleasing about hearing a band sound so comfortable in their skin. Even if you don't connect with the music on Wilco (The Album), you may come away from the record envying their relaxed self-assurance. Being a chilled-out grown-up may not always be exciting, but it's certainly something to admire and respect.","Jeff Tweedy and co.'s latest does what its title implies, consolidating their eclectic style into a coherent statement of identity.

Against the Day,Land of Kush,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a394ea9e61561daa4cf0/1:1/w_160/8ccb929c.jpg,2009-06-26 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12912-against-the-day/,Constellation,"Since Sam Shalabi enjoyed his mini-breakout in 2004 with the Shalabi Effect's The Trial of St. Orange, the Montreal composer has explored the overlap between popular Western music and traditional Middle Eastern musics, particularly those from Egypt, the country from which Shalabi's parents hailed. These projects tend to be diffuse and ambitious: Shalabi works with dozens of musicians on long, brash drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land of Kush, Shalabi's newest project, is pretty much par for his course, as Against the Day features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles drawn from the five chapters of Thomas Pynchon's Against the Day. Like fellow Constellation traveler Efrim Menuck (A Silver Mt. Zion, Godspeed You! Black Emperor), who helped record and mix Against the Day, Shalabi has mostly abandoned an early formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced Shalabi's execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment and passion to his art. Against the Day's mistakes are similarly easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety. As always, Shalabi's realized blend of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde; should you happen to be familiar with 1960s Egyptian orchestral music... well, please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of Shalabi's early work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""Iceland Spar"", with its awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western, as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading to an apocalypse: ""1,000 years to one day."" The centerpiece of Against the Day is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"", which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung by Molly Sweeney-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good, grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field of economics""). When Sweeney sings that the man doesn't ""know squatÂ  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening, imbuing Against the Day with a frailty its huge movements sometimes lack. Shalabi's troupe doesn't always exhibit such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous atmosphere, fail to capture any of Shalabi's murky psych magic.Â  Elsewhere, portions of ""Iceland Spar"" and ""Bilocations"" make it seem as if Shalabi is trying to reverse a freighter in a small bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. Shalabi sets his collaborators in motion but can't always steer them. This makes Against the Day an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small amount of folly. Shalabi trades in movements, not moments, though, and Against the Day's frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his imagination.","Shalabi Effect's Sam Shalabi returns with a project that explores the dissection ofÂ popular Western sounds andÂ 1960s Egyptian orchestral music.

Bestia,Hello Seahorse!,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5115e6ef959693209fb/1:1/w_160/555e8c00.jpg,2009-06-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13234-bestia/,MUN,"Okay, don't laugh. I just finished David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, a brilliant thousand-page tome of postmodern, apocalyptic indulgence that, to over-simplify, requires almost as much pretense to read as it might have taken to write. The book, published in 1996, foresaw the rise in Bush-era thick-headedness and ubiquitous on-demand entertainment, all set in a unified North America. Thing is, most of the action takes place between Americans and a conflicted Canada (get this: QuÃ©bÃ©cois terrorists seek to distribute an American film so entertaining, it will literally kill you), while Mexico dutifully bows to the American President's whim. Just about the most vibrant picture of Mexico is the ironically re-imagined presidential seal where the eagle wears a sombrero. Point is, America often views (some might say ""stereotypes"") Mexico through the filter of its rich tradition rather than its current culture. However, globalization having done its thing, the new generation of young Mexicans is making art with increasingly international roots, including indie rock. While Canada has already gotten its share of attention (cf. Jest's killer entertainment; in real life, they've got Arcade Fire), Mexican exports like Juan Son, Seamus, and Hello Seahorse! (whose new record, Bestia, is out now)-- whoÂ weave their Anglo-Continental influences into sublimated Latin textures--Â still await American adoption. In fact, Hello Seahorse!'s best known song could just as easily have come out of Montreal or Stockholm as la Ciudad de MÃ©xico. ""Won't Say Anything"", sung in English, affects the anthemic twee of Los Campesinos! or (at their best) I'm From Barcelona, repeating the eponymous refrain into the ether on the group's last record Hoy a las Ocho. Bestia contains no English language singing, and also nothing quite on the level of ""Won't Say Anything"", but it's a drastically darker and more complex effort. Opener ""Bestia"" crescendos into an explosion of overdriven drums and synthesizer lines before hitting Lo Blondo's icily recorded vocals. Blondo told webzine ""Al Borde"" the band desired to create a record that communicated their emotions, and it doesn't take a degree in Spanish to get the conflict in those feelings. Even seemingly upbeat cuts like ""Criminal"" are pregnant with the seeds of minor-key melancholy underneath their peppy Casio lines. The urge to get something, anything off their chest is so palpable, it can undercut the elegant melodies the band honed on Hoy A Las Ocho. The near-classic moments here, ""Bestia"" and ""Oso Polar"", combine melodic complexity with the relative simplicity of rapid-fire verse-chorus-verse interplay and the reliable signifiers of simple wonky synthesizers. The band's fussiest cuts, on the other hand, sound like the same brilliant lines sung in agonizing slow motion. Of course, I risk judging a record whose language I barely understand too rigorously by the standards of twee and indie, sounds largely formed by British art-school kids. Likewise, there's a potential danger that the appearance of these young Mexican groups signals cultural co-optation, kind of like a musical analogue to the ubiquity of McDonalds in foreign countries. But wherever Hello Seahorse! planted their musical roots, their heartfelt take on the (assumedly) complicated emotions that accompany melodic elegance places them amongst the continent's most exciting current young groups. The band seems inexorably tied with the fortunes of a youth culture radiating out of Mexico City that seeks an additive effect on their nation's musical identity. And hey, Bestia may not be lethally entertaining, but it'll sure kill a lot of stereotypes.","One of the leading lights of a rich vein of Mexican indie rock, Hello Seahorse! come off like a Western Hemisphere version of Los Campesinos!

Ganglians, a beardo four-piece from Sacramento, do just that. Their brand of psychedelia is the latest offering from Woodsist, a Brooklyn label putting out records by what could be considered lo-fi's new guard: Kurt Vile, Wavves, Woods, Crystal Stilts, Vivian Girls, and Blank Dogs, to name a few. (Many of which have enjoyed a considerable amount of ink in this corner of the musicnerdiverse.) Though each of these acts roughs up music a little differently, all sound at home in the bedroom or basement. But Ganglians are wild men-- they make music that gets fresh air all up in your teeth and gums. Like a former labelmate of theirs, Ganglians have released two equally robust records almost simultaneously. Their self-titled EP appe-teaser comes within whistling distance of a full-length and is the more prickly and scrambled of the pair. Opener ""Hair"" is surf rock slicing through filthy water, a standout whose melodic scope is somehow lost in the instant crash and fray of ""Rats Man"". Such jarring transitions, while never draining life from the EP's songs individually, typify the scattershot nature of the record as a whole. Take the synth-and-shout of ""Never Mind"" and ""Snake Eyes"", both nicely disjointed in a way that would have made the more cohesive Monster Head Room topple. The latter kicks off with a snippet of a dude letting a pretty weak burp loose, a sampling choice that's in grody contrast to the field recordings peppered throughout the full-length. Crickets sound great almost anytime, right? Monster Head Room is a stronger set of songs from top to bottom. Polished-up holdover tracks from the EP-- ""The Void"" and ""Candy Girl""-- round out a playlist that's remarkably languid. Outhouse acoustic numbers like ""Cryin' Smoke"" and the iridescent ""Lost Words"", both stupidly beautiful, fold in with meatier, more groove-oriented tracks like ""100 Years"" and ""Valient Brave"". The latter is a near seven-minute highlight that opens itself up entirely, rolling through a few minutes of pastoral down-strumming before the low-end arrives and transforms the song into an epic pow-wow with the Kinks. But those two stripes of jam interact with one another with an organic ease that most records in this vein sorely miss, a quality that more than compensates for Monster Head Room's lack of variety. Fidelity aside, that's a feeling punctuated by the wonderfully damaged vocal harmonies of closer ""Try to Understand"". It's a bike-ride of a song that puts its own spin the Beach Boys or the psych-folk-pop-argh of Grizzly Bear. But while Grizzly Bear manicure and cloister their psych folk in the parlor, Ganglians slather and cake them in mud. Then they set them free.","Ganglians are the latest act on Brooklyn's Woodsist; over an EP and full-length, they craft a rough brand of psychedelia that leaves room for pastoral beauty.

A Psychedelic Guide to Monsterism Island,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50d13d1975652138e63/1:1/w_160/81ff8830.jpg,2009-06-26 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13230-a-psychedelic-guide-to-monsterism-island/,Lo,"Monsters, in general, are pretty hard to ignore. So it is with the visual creations of Welsh artist and toymaker Pete Fowler. Readers of this review will most likely know Fowler from the space aliens and other strange cartoonish beasties he has drawn for the covers of every Super Furry Animals album since 1997 except for one (2007's Hey Venus!, created byÂ Japan's Keiichi Tanaami). Love 'em or hate 'em, Fowler's fanciful, bulbous images have helped SFA establish a visual aesthetic every bit as distinctive as their music, with a shared spirit of childlike mischief and spaced-out merriment. A Psychedelic Guide to Monsterism Island-- the follow-up to 2005's impossibly scarce The Sounds of Monsterism Island, Vol. 1-- is basically a soundtrack to the lovingly detailed dreamworld inhabited by Fowler's characters. In film terms, though, it works more like a score than a hit-crammed blockbuster soundtrack, conjuring its woozy and whimsical mood out of 20 mostly instrumental tracks of folk, prog, cosmic disco, and hazy Moog rock. In other words, it's uncharacteristically easy to ignore, floating almost at the edge of perception. As with the like-minded psychedelia on London label Ghost Music, however, you shouldn't necessarily hold that against it. This can be transportative stuff. Even if the compilation isn't always mind-blowing, psych nerds and obscurity-seekers should be able to find a few choice tracks to spin or sample. Super Furries frontman Gruff Rhys' ""Wild Robots Power Up"" sounds like its title, all chintzy electronic beats and hypnotic power-station drones. The Future Sound of London, appearing under their Amorphous Androgynous alias, go in for woolly psych-rock that's as bubbly as Fowler's creations. Inclusions from Luke Vibert, Beyond the Wizard Sleeve (aka Richard Norris), Circulus, and Belbury Poly range from sine-wave workouts to ominous grooves and even hobbit-ready lute-folk. The bright strums of Brazilian DJ/producer duo ""Magic Morning"" on ""Monsters at Work"" are quietly revelatory, inhabiting a universe not far from Quiet Village or recent nu-Balearic. The disc's biggest flaw lies in apparently assuming we've already made the trip to Monsterism Island rather than gently guiding us there. The krautrock repetitions of Marc Shearer's ""Magma on My Mind"" or the Southern-fried electric guitar noodling of Wolf People's ""Village Strollin'"" are enjoyable enough on their own, but as compiled here, it all starts to blend together. Many listeners will find themselves drifting off-- losing themselves not in Monsterism Island, but in the late-2000s' many realtime distractions. The spoken-word interludes are a cute affectation, and they could take on more meaning if Fowler's talked-about children's TV show ever gets off the ground, but you won't find yourself wanting to listen to them very often. Still, every time my head starts nodding, A Psychedelic Guide to Monsterism Island jolts me back to attentiveness with moments of Fowlerian wryness. Take the Advisory Circle's ""Lair of the Grolfax"", which sounds like ""You Only Live Twice"" covered as intergalactic lounge music by Air. ""What a strange dream,"" a monster's deep, gruff voice intones on the closing track, summing up the whole collection. ""It ebbs from my mind like treacle."" Monster treacle?","Artist and designer Pete Fowler drafts SFA's Gruff Rhys, Luke Vibert, and FSOL for a record full ofÂ of childlike mischief and spaced-out merriment.

You have to wonder if this was a shout-out to their li'l homey Bibio, who cut three records for Mush from the whole cloth of this idea. Like his idols, he filled his electro-acoustic music with antiquated cultural products and nature sounds-- things that are beautiful because we've less and less use for them. But he lacked range, his wavering loop-collages falling into two categories: those informed by the sprightly forms of British folk, and those that were nearly formless. Bibio released Vignetting the Compost just five months ago, and it seemed to cement his status as a pleasant one-trick pony. So it's shocking how utterly and successfully he rewrites his playbook on this Warp debut. I actually have to eat a little crow. I wrote of Compost that Bibio had a ""thin, modest voice that verges on anonymity,"" and suggested that he should favor atmosphere over songcraft. This seemed justified: The more the songs approximated pop structures, the less interesting they became. But on Ambivalence Avenue, Bibio proves that he actually can sing and produce memorable arrangements. He used to make FX blurs with traces of pop and folk; now he inverts that formula with bracing clarity. The results are fantastic and diverse: The title track weaves bouncing vocals through crisp guitar licks and bouncy flutes; ""All the Flowers"" is a fey folk gem; the dreamy ""Haikuesque (When She Laughs)"" is better indie-rock than many indie-rockers are making these days. Summery anthem ""Lovers' Carvings"" coasts on crunchy, gleaming riffs and upbeat woodblocks, and the autumnal ""The Palm of Your Wave"" is simply haunting. It's hard to believe that these inspired, moving vocal performances are coming from the same guy who recorded moaning ambiguities like ""Mr. & Mrs. Compost"". Occasionally, you'll hear a little tremble in the strings and go, ""Oh right, this is Bibio,"" but mostly, detuned atmosphere has been replaced by silky drive. While these songs are a quantum leap for Bibio, they still reasonably project from the foundation he's laid. But there's no accounting for the remainder of the album, which finds him paddling the uncharted waters of hip-hop, techno, and points outlying. ""Jealous of Roses"" sets lustrous funk riffs dancing between the stereo channels as Bibio belts out a surprisingly effective Sly-Stone-in-falsetto impersonation. ""Fire Ant"" spikes the loping soul of J Dilla with the stroboscopic vocal morsels of the Field; ""Sugarette"" wheezes and fumes like a Flying Lotus contraption. The music feels both spontaneous and precise, winding in complex syncopation around the one-beat, with subtle filter and tempo tweaks, and careful juxtapositions of texture (see the arid, throttled voices scraping against the sopping-wet chimes of ""S'vive""). Many songs taper off into ambient passages that have actual gravity, gluing the far-flung genres together. It's the kind of seamless variety, heady but visceral, that few electronic musicians who aren't Four Tet have achieved. While Ambivalence Avenue is an excellent album by any measure, Bibio deserves extra credit for venturing outside of his established comfort zone. He began his musical career trying to emulate Steve Reich and Boards of Canada on no-fi equipment. He was fascinated by the physicality of media-- of degrading tape and malfunctioning recording gear. And he was interested in the natural world, letting the sounds of streams and rainshowers stand in for his own personality. Having depleted these ideas over the course of three solid albums, he's put them aside to do nearly the opposite. Ambivalence Avenue moves the focus from the flaws of media to their capacity for precision, and takes fewer cues from nature than from the urban sounds-- including Dilla and Madlib-- that Bibio admits discovering in recent years. By jettisoning a limiting aesthetic, he reveals his abilities to be startlingly vast, and one of our most predictable electronic musicians becomes a wild card.","Incorporating elements of cut-up soul and hip-hop, this is a stunning transformation for a guy that seemed like a one-trick pony focused only on atmosphere.

World I See / The Way We Are,The Present,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a562ea9e61561daa5119/1:1/w_160/7943e9c1.jpg,2009-06-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13306-world-i-see-the-way-we-are/,LOAF,"As a producer, Rusty Santos has placed his hand in many, many jars. In addition to his work on game-changers like Animal Collective's Sung Tongs and Panda Bear's Person Pitch, Santos has also helped shaped sounds on record for Gang Gang Dance, fellow Paw Track clan member Dent May, as well as last year's much slept-upon Born Ruffians long-player Red Yellow & Blue. Trying to pick up on threads that run constant throughout a rÃ©sumÃ© that varied would make for some headphone headaches. Fortunately, Santos formed a band of his own. The Present is Santos' recent collaboration with Japanese musician Mina and Jesse Lee of Gang Gang Dance and White Magic, a project in which Santos further experiments with fusing together much of the same gossamer textures and elements that galvanized the walls of sound he helped erect as a producer. In October of last year, the trio released World I See, a remarkably arranged spirit journey that, according to Santos, was written and recorded stream of consciousness, using just guitar, keys, and drums. But it never sounds that simple nor familiar-- the line between organic and synthetic remains ever blurred. In fact, the sharp divide between the Present's output and their straight-ahead setup is a gap still very much a part of what also makes the band's latest audiomosaic, The Way We Are, just as fascinating. Opener ""Heavens on Ice"" spans 13 minutes of astral transmissions and vocal warp zones. Couched somewhere in all the synthetic chaos sits a short-lived stretch of breathtaking guitar melody and tribal rhythms totally unblemished. It's worth the mining, pretty yet inaccessible. Interlude ""Love Melody"" is equally beautiful, a chunk of magnetic oasis that sits between even more shards of manipulated sound, all of which clatter and skitter and morph into duo ""Symbols on High"" and ""Africanized Beatniks"". For better or worse, The Way We Are is more easily digested than its predecessor. Though the synth palette is less abrasive and the song lengths infinitely less intimidating (only ""Saltwater Trails"" comes close to flirting with the 10-minute mark), it's still very closely related in purpose. ""Shapeshifter"" sandwiches a grind of harsh screens and lunar-laundromat noise between cascades of keys. To close: ""Press Play"", a staunchly industrial jam that lets only a few slivers of light through before calling it a day. This is a difficult listening experience for certain, but check those album titles: Santos seems to be trying to transcend the idea of listening experience in particular. He's taken to finding a spectrum of sound that mirrors more than just a moment.","Person Pitch and Sung Tongs producer Rusty Santos teams with members of Gang Gang Dance and White Magic to create a pair of art-rock records.

The Loud Wars,So Many Dynamos,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4895e6ef959693208c5/1:1/w_160/cd38b981.jpg,2009-06-25 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13118-the-loud-wars/,Vagrant,"What a time our nation's capital was having around the turn of the century. You could count on two hands the number of people actually affected by our president's latest dick move. Newt Gingrich had left both his posts, and for an all-too-brief while, things were quiet on the batshit front.Â The District's favorite sons, Fugazi had settled into a nice little rut before their as-yet-unbroken hiatus, and as the last decade has taught us, a world with Fugazi is preferable to one without. It's easy to romanticize turn of the century D.C. as a creative hotbed, especially with the records to prove it; the DeSoto and Dischord catalogs are testament to the wellspring beneath the swamp city as we entered the second Bush administration. Certainly So Many Dynamos are as guilty of it as any, as they've built a career around the breathless hooks, hyperkinetic song structure, splattery disco-funk drums, and emo confessionalism of the city's now-decade-old renaissance. Never mind that they're Midwestern boys who didn't get around to dropping their first full length until well after the 'Plan dismembered; as a downstate Illinoisian with precisely zero Burning Airlines tickets stubs in my collection, I, too, think fondly of a scene of which I wasn't anywhere close to a member. In most ways, it's great to have a 2009 record that'd keep the awkward button-up-and-Converse dance party of No Kill No Beep Beep going strong; even now, 1999-era D.C. is certainly fresher ground than, say, two years later in New York. But it's hard not to think of So Many Dynamos as much more than a throwback act, particularly without the songs some of their time-travel contemporaries managed to eek out. Any D.C. band worth its loft space had to have a rhythm section as locked-in as the Republican-controlled Congress, and in synth-bassist/vocalist Aaron Stovall and drummer Clayton Kunstel, the Dynamos certainly have that. It's the first thing you'll notice on opener ""Artifacts of Sound"" and, well, much of the rest of The Loud Wars; Stovall and Kunstel just dig in, with Stovall's forcible fingerwork and Kunstel's from-all-directions drumming lay the groundwork for virtually off of the Wars. This rock-solid foundation allows for embellishment wherever there's a spare inch, and the Dynamos dress up Loud Wars in whirring trebly synths and, yes, ""angular"" guitar stabs and as many of Stovall's words that will fit in the space. So, yeah, if you'd walked into Melody Records circa summer 1999 and heard The Loud Wars, you wouldn't have batted an eye. And that's just it; The Loud Wars is formula, and it's not even really the Dynamos' formula to use, so when the songs fall a bit flat, it's hard to know whom to point the finger at. The Loud Wars runs on amicably enough-- helped by its ripchord pace from front-to-back, yet another D.C. trademark that marked the least essential-in-hindsight of those records-- and you'd be hard up to finger a bad tune here, but it's all about the same: the same reference points, the same too-busy-by-half arrangements, the same emphasis on proficiency over depth, the same defensively bummed out lyrics, the same slightly sour melodies, the same sense that you're dancing through some kind of dread that's hard to place a finger on. It also doesn't help that this is certainly the Dynamos' least engaging record sonically--Â everything feels squashed, the same color of burnt umber, a hue courtesy of traditionally more technicolor producer Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie-- or that Stovall's voice seems to be veering a little farther from Travis Morrison (which is good!) and a little closer to that dude from Cake. That is less good. When I take The Loud Wars as a justifiably forgotten but enjoyable enough record from a bygone era, I'm soothed; it's a little better than, oh, Fake French or something, and I'm sure as hell not going to dig around to find that one with this thing floating around. But it's 2009, and as you're well aware, D.C.'s turned over a couple times now, which makes what So Many Dynamos are doing roughly as fresh as a Linda Tripp joke. One can't help but wonder what the Dynamos might find if they fixed their gaze a ways past Fort Reno; go-go, perhaps?","St. Louis band recalls D.C.'s turn of the century creative spark with a record that sounds as if could have come from late-90s DeSoto or Dischord.

Spoils,Alasdair Roberts,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47fc0084474cd0c04d6/1:1/w_160/e9d2a4c8.jpg,2009-06-25 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13110-spoils/,Drag City,"You know all those singer-songwriters who get called ""intelligent"" just because the coy cultural references they make are so easily gotten by anyone else who reads McSweeney's? Yes? Well, fuck them in the eye socket with their own falling-apart thesauruses! Better yet, fuck them in the eye socket with an Alasdair Roberts record-- with this record, Spoils. Because, damn, Alasdair Roberts has made the best album of his 14-year career. And while it's very smart, you might not even know that it's as smart as it is until after you've heard it a dozen times. That it's so strong considering it's a weirdo folk-rock record with lyrics like ""I was bilious and saturnine/ As I walked from shrine to wayside shrine"" is almost a miracle. Writers like to compare Roberts' work to that of Will Oldham's. Hardly a word gets written about the guy without first mentioning that what Oldham does to American trad folk, Roberts does to its British counterpart. Seeing that they share the same record label, have worked together, and both obviously fuck around with the idea of ""folk"" in their own ways, it's not the worst comparison. The way Roberts pushes the envelope for Brit. Isles-based music is perhaps closer to the way that singer/guitarist Nic Jones' justly-revered arrangements of ancient forgotten whaling shanties and murder-suicide ballads updated those songs by adding new melodies carefully picked on his guitar. But no one's going to confuse Roberts' version of ""The Magpie's Nest"" with Shirley Collins', or his take on ""When a Man's in Love"" with Chris Foster's. And though the guy has made entire traditional albums, he's not a traditional artist. This record is all originals, and it's very strange, if subtly so. These eight songs pick up where 2007's genre-tweaking Amber Gatherers left off. But they also resonate with the melodic goodness of his stripped-down 2001 debut, The Crook of My Arm. And you could say that they regain the occasional freak-out intensity of Roberts' work with/as Appendix Out. The main developments over prior recordings are sonic and structural: the super ripping guitar that cuts through on ""Hazel Forks""; the heavy electric guitar that kicks in halfway through the seven-minute ""The Flying of Grief & Joy (Eternal Return)""; the doubled-up flutes on ""You Muses Assist""; the thunder cracks and violin peering through behind cascading nylon strings on ""Under No Enchantment (But My Own)"". The songs often muck about to create new structures: bits of a ballad form collapse in on parts of a reel that collides with sort of a pop anthem. Is it prog? The album makes this listener want to live inside a cozy little cottage in the countryside, something made of wood and stone with ancient leaded windows covered in moss, so maybe. The way Roberts' often high-pitched brogue wraps itself around sentences is pretty as hell; his voice has never sounded better, nor has it been recorded this clearly before. There's a sense of humor at work with Roberts that meshes quite well with his poetic way with words. It takes multiple listens to get at the tunes' meaning, and not just because of differences between the mother tongue and the American one. It's hard to argue with the sentiment of ""Ned Ludd's Rant (For a World Rebarbarised)"", which could be from an album by London garage-rocker Dan Melchior: ""Now we rob graverobber's graves and redisplay the plunder/ And we fill some dead composer's staves with irony and thunder,"" he sings, before ending the song with, ""That's only what this old guitar puts into my mouth.""","Appendix Out driving force has made one of the best albums of his career, a varied set of folk-inspired originals with plenty of subtle surprises.

Varshons,The Lemonheads,by: Stephen M.

Allin. You'd be hard pressed to find three more disparate rock acts, yet on Varshons they all sound like the Lemonheads-- boppy, overcast alt-rock delivered at a fast clip and sung in a whiskey tenor. Since their earliest albums, the Boston group has made covers a cornerstone of their concerts and albums, such that you could assemble a pretty wide-ranging retrospective based wholly on their treatments of songs by Suzanne Vega, Charles Manson, the Louvin Brothers, and Hair. And Varshons starts predictably strong: The Lemonheads play Parsons' ""I Just Can't Take It Anymore"" like it was written especially for them, much as they did with his ""Brass Buttons"" years ago, and Wire's ""Fragile"" is a short burst of desert melody that turns the tense rhythms of the original into a light-as-air sing-along reminiscent of It's a Shame About Ray. But the keeper here is ""Layin' Up with Linda"", which despite its unsavory aspects-- mindless violence against women-- manages the nifty trick of turning Allin's skeezepunk original into a country-tinged murder ballad. As discomfiting as that song may be, it not only makes the next song, Townes Van Zandt's ""Waiting Around to Die"", sound tame but proves that Dando's women troubles are a lot more compelling than his drug problems. Starting with Randy Alvey & the Green Fuz's ""Green Fuz"", a middling hallucinogenic number, Varshons descends into a narco-musical haze. ""Yesterlove"" is a superlatively stoned joint originally by rock tabla player Sam Gopal; Dando keeps that instrument as the song's foundation, which means it doesn't sound much like the Lemonheads. Similarly, ""Dandelion Seeds"", originally by psychedelic outfit July, is an aimless trip that meets the original in the past instead of bringing it up to date. The depth and breadth of the tracklist are commendable but often work against the band. Dando obviously has a large collection of vinyl and a good knowledge of rarely trampled pop terrain, but what good is it if most everything here comes across as either half-assed or poorly chosen? Half the fun of any covers album is hearing an artist translate songs to their own particular sound, reimagining and reinventing them in their own image. As such, the cover of Arling & Cameron's ""Dirty Robot"" sounds like cheating. They use the same turgid synths that clogged the original,Â which means the song sounds like the work of a different band. Kate Moss' vocals are really the only interesting aspect of the cover, not because they're especially inspired but because it's Kate fuckin' Moss. Liv Tyler fares better on an otherwise limp cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye"",Â where her soft vocals make a striking complement to Dando's. It's almost ironic that the best cover here is also the least obscure. Linda Perry's ""Beautiful"" is becoming a standard of the 2000s; originally sung by Christina Aguilera, it's been covered by Clem Snide, the All-American Rejects, and Elvis Costello. But here Dando makes it his own, even if that means he makes it sound like it's playing over the closing credits to Empire Records. It's an ideal match between singer and song, a surprising moment that almost makes up for the mess that came before it. Almost.","Evan Dando's crew take on everyone from Wire to Gram Parsons, G.G.

Beacons of Ancestorship,Tortoise,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48e5e6ef959693208d0/1:1/w_160/3f729c8d.jpg,2009-06-25 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13121-beacons-of-ancestorship/,Thrill Jockey,"Between 1996's groundbreaking Millions Now Living Will Never Die and 2001's pacesetting Standards, Tortoise garnered a level of influence in indie music that almost rivals that of Animal Collective today. Post-rock was one of the most active threads of 90s indie, and Tortoise not only set the bar for it, they leaped right over it. While many of their peers interpreted post-rock as ""rock, but boring,"" they hybridized completely novel forms. Their music was informed not only by Chicago's energetic out-jazz scene, but also drum'n'bass, electro, lounge music, techno, hip-hop, dub, and modernist innovations. They released a remix record way before that was really a done thing in indie rock. They didn't single-handedly broaden the genre's horizons, but their stature could make it appear that way-- after Standards, for a minute, it seemed as if other bands were going to have to rush to catch up. And then, Tortoise rather quietly faded from view. What happened? At some point in the first of the decade, indie rock values shifted a bit: cerebral was out, and emotions were back in fashion. As if wrong-footed by this shift, Tortoise clammed up until 2004, when they returned with the unfocused It's All Around You, and then followed with a covers album. Thus their first new album in five years, Beacons of Ancestorship, findsÂ Tortoise in a unique position. Now that smuggling non-guitar genres into indie rock is commonplace, the record could feel like a postmortem of Tortoise's own influence, and the air of self-consciousness that often attends their music thickens. At their best, Tortoise make academic genre-exercises sound brawny and visceral, and the first half of Beacons finds them firing on all circuits. The first six songs are pretty much straight fire, especially ""Northern Something"", with its icy clockwork percussion and a hyperactive bass line that throbs like a tooth ache. If it sounds a little French Touch-y, that's appropriate: Dance music has always been in Tortoise's arsenal, but it takes center stage here. Thrust and lift, pause and glide, are favored over tricky atmosphere. It's modular music, with static and rushing analog synths interpenetrating around crisp, cyclical percussion. Genre allusions proliferate like footnotes: the double-time clap-track at the end of iridescent guitar-and-synth anthem ""Prepare Your Coffin"", or the brief but compelling ""Penumbra"", which appears to try and replicate the sound of pitch-shifted loops with live players. ""Gigantes"" is a wave of minimalist snips and ripples, and opener ""High Class Slim Came Floatin' In"" is a chin-stroking rave dissection, its movements divided by surgical slices rather than MDMA-stoking whooshes. The synths turn against the drums as precisely as fine-threaded screws, and the explosive climax feels both awesome and unearned. It demonstrates how Tortoiseâs meticulous poise can sap their music's energy-- despite the overdriven synths, the track feels heavy handedly mediated, like a cut-away diagram of a song. A curious thing happens after this vigorous opening stretch. After pivoting on the punk-rock blast of ""Yinxianghechengqi"", Tortoise lose enthusiasm for the about-techno aesthetic they're exploring, and gently backslide toward the alien lounge music that seems to be their lowest gear. As this happens, it bolsters the sense of stiffness on tracks like ""High Class Slim"". ""The Fall of Seven Diamonds Plus One"" is the kind of high-desert Morricone fantasy it feels like they've done a million times before, and ""Monument Six One Thousand"" tentatively splits the difference between dreamy-Tortoise and dancey-Tortoise. ""Minors"" simply recapitulates the same ideas as ""Prepare Your Coffin"" with less conviction. It's not that these songs are bad, any more than It's All Around You was bad-- they're just a little low-impact from a band of whom we expect a lot. The funny thing is that for most bands, Beacons of Ancestorship would be the very definition of an ambitious record-- commanding, aiming for conceptual unity and broad scope. But this mode seems to come naturally for Tortoise, and their mastery of it accounts for the record's broad successes and slight drawbacks alike. At this point, an ambitious Tortoise record would loosen the reins a bit, perhaps even enlist an outside producer to puncture the band's hermetic seal, and let in a bit of the world. You want to see them lose some control, to sacrifice a bit of the exactitude they've honed and allow for serendipity. You want to see them at least risk fucking up, and acknowledging that music is played by humans. Now that Tortoise have inarguably mastered the consideration of their namesake, it might not hurt them to tap into a little of the impulsiveness of the hare.","Tortoise finally make their jam band record, but manage to wonderfully blend it with both the dance- and lounge-rooted aspects of their sound.

Someday This Could All Be Yours,The Paper Chase,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a445b1335d7bf16988fe/1:1/w_160/c67ecec2.jpg,2009-06-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13061-someday-this-could-all-be-yours/,Kill Rock Stars,"We've been assured the Paper Chase'sÂ Someday This Could All Be Yours is a simpler, if not necessarily kinder record from them: ten songs, no interludes, no interstitial chit-chat. But this is a band with a sense of humor so dark it can make Xiu Xiu look like Fountains of Wayne. So, sure, it's probably the Paper Chase's most typically digestible work; it's also an exploration of humankind's futile attempts to manage itself in the face of catastrophe set to erratic squall, equal parts delirium and stone-cold sobriety. The Paper Chase's singularity is certainly something to be admired, especially when musical discussion too often boils down to ""belongs in genre X""/""sounds like bands Y & Z."" When you get the itch to listen to Someday, nothing else is going to suffice except for maybe other Paper Chase albums. It can also be a ceiling for your enjoyment in the event you value versatility or demand that bands should always have some sort of artistic trajectory in mind: it's been three years since Now You Are One of Us and the only musical touch-ups are what could be a harpsichord and maybe 30 seconds of acoustic guitar. So yes, Someday still manages to be undeniably the work of the Paper Chase, a continuation of the sort of musical scrapple they've made hay on, which is to say it's completely unappetizing going only on the ingredients. The songs here are composed of nasty little things-- tingling bits of piano wire, piercing guitar squawk, flatted thirds, minor seconds. Nearly every stringed instrument gets employed for dissonance taken separately, and yet collectively they become palatable, even catchy. It's easy to give too many props to the production of John Congleton-- after all, he's done engineering work with Modest Mouse (whose whole career gets summarized in about two and a half minutes on ""The Laying of Hands, the Speaking in Tongues [The Mass Hysteria]"") as well as Antony and the Johnsons. Plus, his straitjacketed, strangulated vocals suggest a lifetime of sipping from Saddle Creek. Yet like last time, there are plenty of sturdy, major-key melodies that go straight for the jugular. But whatever sing-along quality they have, their effectiveness is almost always determined by context. When Now You Are One of Us' ""Wait Until I Get My Hands on You"" pilfered the ""Father & Son"" melody, it was less a homage than an act of molestation. You get something of an overt repeat on that strategy when ""The Small of Your Back, the Nape of Your Neck (The Blizzard)"" explodes into ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"", but more often, Congleton smears and smudges.Â You'd think the forceful string coda of ""If Nobody Moves, Nobody Will Get Hurt (The Extinction)"" would drive home the vocal melody, but instead, at the end of each bar, it just misses the mark by a half-step or so. By the next song, Congleton is ""drawing a bloodbath"" and ""going to heaven"" with or without you in what appears to be the record's most obvious mismanagement of U2's anthemics until the most truly anthemic song on the record recalls the chorus from ""Walk On"". It's called ""This Is a Rape (The Flood)"". Welcome to the Paper Chase's world of anthems for the misshapes and misfits.","This singular Dallas band turns in its most digestible work, but it's stillÂ an exploration of humankind's futile attempts to manage itself.

Travels With Myself and Another,Future of the Left,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a484b1335d7bf16989a7/1:1/w_160/a40adbb8.jpg,2009-06-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13115-travels-with-myself-and-another/,4AD,"I'd like to humbly ask my peers to stop using ""ex-Mclusky"" tag with these guys, because with Travels With Myself and Another, they're done fucking around. Every seemingly strange left turn from their debut, Curses, is stranger, carried further, and more focused and much catchier here. The band still starts and stops on a dime, the vocals are still layered and ambitious even when seething, the song titles still raise a challenging bar for the music to live up to (""Yin/Post -Yin"", ""You Need Satan More Than He Needs You""), and the low-end on the guitars still sound like angry bears. Granted, this is how both Mclusky and FOTL built the niche that drew in a loyal, fervent audience, but Travels is the sound of band who still have a lot they want to prove. With a few striking exceptions, most of the keyboards from the band's debut have been ditched in favor of searing guitar tones (see ""Chin Music"" or ""Land of My Formers""). Many of the albums' hooks come from strident, almost militaristic melodies-- I doubt that ""Arming Eritrea"" is too concerned with real geography, but damned if I wouldn't help fund the revolt now after the record's screaming, indelible opening track. The woozy march of ""The Hope That House Built"" is an existentialist call-to-arms, while the mid-tempo chug of ""I Am Civil Service"" floats up a few melodic, playful bars just to shoot down with its blistering chorus. Straightforward and snarling, these tracks suggest the band still thinks modern rock might be a genre worth infiltrating and upending. But about those keyboards: ""Throwing Bricks at Trains"" is a spirited pub sing along over an organ that sounds soggy with distortion. Falkous documents small-town boredom with surprising empathy and charm here (not to mention barbershop-worthy background vocals), though is a little more haunted or torn elsewhere. He's nearly theatrical on ""You Need Satan More Than He Needs You"", the most synth-heavy and yet the most pummeling track here, finding layers of neuroses in devil worship. The record loses some steam after ""Satan""; most any record probably would. They follow it up with some Saturday-morning-cartoon psychedelia on ""Yin/Post yin"", manic tales of families shamed by plastic silverware (""Stand By/Your Manatee"") and delirious amounts of guitar-string scrapes and syncopated vocals (""Drink Nike""). Closer ""Lapsed Catholics"" starts out with something new for the band-- acoustic guitar-- while inscrutable joke lyrics lead into more locally-aimed bile and more existential pondering, before punctuating it all with one of the record's most titanic riffs halfway through. Throughout the album, Falkous sets up binaries in his lyrics to be tugged between: home and abroad (""when in Rome remember home is always here for you,"" he sings in ""Land of My Formers"") Satan worship and practical dress, the cynics of ""Arming Eritrea"" and the âfighters and buggersâ who âhave it rightâ in âChin Musicâ, and those ""who know who they were, and who they will be again"" against those doomed to continue figuring it out in the dark (""Lapsed Catholics""). Even without these extra layers, Travels With Myself and Another might be the finest soundtrack for slam dancing, fast driving, heavy drinking, or whatever poor decision you make this year. But in addition finding new ways to snarl in their music, the lyrics go beyond mere cleverness into sharp, thoughtful introspection, making Travels a document of a creatively restless band out to prove something to themselves, and not just the fans theyâve picked up along the way.","Ex-Mclusky guys createÂ the finest soundtrack for slam dancing, fast driving, heavy drinking, or whatever poor decision you make this year.

Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a512b1335d7bf1698af6/1:1/w_160/6f235350.jpg,2009-06-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13235-spinnerette/,Anthem,"Former Pitchforker Eric Carr, while reviewing the Distillers' Coral Fang, called singer Brody Dalle ""an impassioned, powerful frontwoman, the legitimate heart of her band, and probably the most dominating female presence-at-large (read: receiving M2 rotation) in rock right now."" Good times. Too bad they didn't last very long. A few years after the release of that major-label debut, the Distillers disbanded, and Dalle spent the ensuing years popping up as a guest on her husband Josh Homme's albums with Queens of the Stone Age and Eagles of Death Metal. She announced a new outfit back in 2007, and it sounded promising: Comprised of fellow former Distiller Tony Bevilacqua, Eagle of Death Metal Alain Johannes, and ex-Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, the new group would expand Dalle's vocal and lyrical range while mixing electric elements with familiar live punk sounds. She even negotiated her way out of her Sire contract and signed with Toronto-based Anthem Entertainment. As the rest of the world moved forward in time, the members of Spinnerette have somehow moved backwards. Grafting programmed and live beats onto processed guitars and filtered vocals, their self-titled debut might have sounded edgy back in 1995, but in the here and now, it just sounds curiously redundant. This is MTV Buzz Bin nostalgia: Spinnerette could be playing the Bronze (great show, crap music) or sharing a bill with Poe and Tracy Bonham. Opener ""Ghetto Love"" and ""Distorting a Code"" are Garbage without the empowering perversions, and Dalle too often sounds like any old post-Courtney howler rather than the woman who breathed fire on ""Drain the Blood"". Even the album cover recalls the Black Crowes'Â Amorica after some airbrushing and a trip to Hot Topic. Genre dumpster-diving of this type is not a bad thing in and of itself, and could be an interesting counterpoint to recent Ian Curtis disinterment or the Springsteen revival, which skew heavily masculine, but it's impossible to discern how self-aware Dalle and the band are in this backwards-looking undertaking. Is it a conscious throwback to and possibly a statement about a different time and style? Or is this their idea of forward-thinking hard rock circa 2010? If the latter, then it's simply a misguided project that will fall beneath the pop-culture radar before the promotional cycle has run its course. The hidden track and what sounds like pre-Limp Bizkit turntable scratching, however, suggest the nostalgic aspect of Spinnerette is intentional. If so, the obvious questions arise: Why this revival? And why now? The album doesn't argue very persuasively for the source material, mistaking slick clangor for gritty production, half-assed hooks for big choruses, and blunt innuendo for authority. So, removed from that decade and placed in this one, Spinnerette sounds a bit sheepish. ""Ghetto Love"" sounds like CSS covering ""My Sharona"", but it's not nearly as exciting as that description might sound. ""Rebellious Palpitations"" and ""Sex Bomb"" come off like Eagles of Death Metal without the hip-shake swagger, trashy fun, or knowing wink, and closer ""A Prescription for Mankind"" aims for rock grandiosity but ODs on squealing guitars, layered vocals, and lugubrious rock ponderings. Still, Dalle may yet manage to come out the other side unscathed by Spinnerette. She writes decent hooks on ""All Babes Are Wolves"" and the relatively sunny ""Baptized by Fire"", and on ""The Walking Dead"" she conveys a vulnerability that contrasts compellingly with her tougher sandpaper vocals-- at least until she sings, ""Hello psycho, is that you in the mirror again?"" She shows greater range than expected, but the clatter of Johannes' busy production too often obscures her charisma and renders her odd punk melodies sadly lifeless. She's better than this perplexing project.","Former Distillers singer Brody Dalle returns, with a new band that also features members of Pearl Jam and Eagles of Death Metal.

Music For Men,Gossip,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4829d034d5c69bf30af/1:1/w_160/0426b101.jpg,2009-06-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13113-music-for-men/,Columbia,"Thank heavens for Beth Ditto. In a world of manufactured, auto-tuned pop stars and wispy-voiced indie-chanteuse pinups it's nice to see an honest-to-god female rock star who is provocative, strong, and sexy with the muscular vocal chops to match. Since the release of 2005's Standing in the Way of Control, Ditto has become a superstar in the UK, hobnobbing with Karl Lagerfeld and Kate Moss and proudly splashing her naked body across the covers of British magazines. But at home in America, the Oregon-by-way-of-Arkansas singer is still a niche artist. That is supposed to change with Music For Men, her band's first studio album for Columbia. It represents Gossip's major-label coming out party, an achievement shepherded byÂ bearded superproducerÂ Rick Rubin. The result is a good Gossip album, one that could soundtrack sweaty summer dance parties, but it also isn't drastically different from their last one. They may now have major-label money and famous friends, but their bluesy-voiced dance-punk remains unchanged-- a fact that is especially surprising given the waning popularity of that genre over the last four years. Ditto may be the ""personality"" of the band, its loud-mouthed, outrageously attired public face, but the power of its sound is anchored by Hannah Blilie's thundering, precise drumming and Brace Paine's choppy, Chic riffs. And on Music For Men these ""sidemen"" are in rare form with drums so taut they sound almost mechanical and pulsing, staccato basslines that call to mind Stevie Nicks' ""Edge of Seventeen"" (as on ""Heavy Cross"") and the ""Knight Rider"" theme song (as on ""Vertical Rhythm""). But fret not, Ditto-worshippers; the arrangements are meticulous but spare, leaving plenty of sonic space for her vocal pyrotechnics. In fact, it is her florid, soulful voice that gives these crisply percussive tracks their melodic kick. With a lean three-person lineup and a crack rhythm section, Gossip have never really been driven by their melodies. They built their reputation on unforgiving rhythmic relentlessness and Ditto's raw, limber warble instead of on singalong anthems or hooky choruses. But there are moments on Music For Men that represent some of the most memorably melodic of their career. In many cases, that's because Ditto has interpolated snippets of classic hits into her throttling garage-disco tunes. ""Love Long Distance"", for instance, quotes ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine""'s ""not much longer would you be my baby"" line, and ""Men in Love"", this album's answer to the last record's gay-rights anthem of a title track, features a ""Chain of Fools""-like ""shame, shame, shame"" refrain. It makes sense that Ditto would be influenced by such soul classics, given the vintage bent of her wail, but the band also pays homage to their disco and hard-rock influences on ""2012"", a standout track that flips Kiss' ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" into a handclap-studded disco-punk anthem that instead announces, ""My heart may never beat again, baby/ Have you got the best of me?"" Though longtime fans of the band may worry that they have left their DIY-punk-scene roots behind for Paris Fashion Week and pictures on Perez Hilton, Music For Men should assuage their fears-- not because it's not a glamorous or glitzy collection (it is), but because it sounds so much like its predecessor. Being caught between the mainstream and the underground may have changed the band's visibility, but it hasn't changed their music much. That is both a relief and little bit of a disappointment. As a musical statement of intent to the throngs of the newly interested, Music For Men shows a clear picture of who Gossip want to be-- a New Millennial Madonna for whom Danceteria never closes. But for those who have been following Gossip's career, waiting with bated breath to see how the band will evolve, this new record may feel a little too much like they are still Standing in the Way of Control.","Beth Ditto and co.-- already stars in the UK-- now take on the U.S. with their Rick Rubin-produced major-label debut.

Dragonslayer,Sunset Rubdown,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50fc0084474cd0c062b/1:1/w_160/e91f5aea.jpg,2009-06-24 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13232-dragonslayer/,Jagjaguwar,"Sunset Rubdown's 2007 album, Random Spirit Lover, served up richly orchestrated, baroque suites-- each song awash with melody, counterpoint, and complex dynamic shifts. It was rewarding, but it was also cramped and fussy. And it was long, or at least it felt long. There was also leader Spencer Krug's cryptic wordplay and metaphors; he hinted at a narrative that the listener wasn't in on.Â Across his many projects (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, Swan Lake), Krug often comes off as brooding, wise, and unknowable-- his music attracts because it's difficult to decode his lyrics and untangle his melodies. However, on his latest Sunset Rubdown album,Â Dragonslayer, Krug gives us a fluent, easily likable version of his work. Dragonslayer is a looser Sunset record-- easier to like, easier to understand. Tension used to come from stops and starts in the songs, but now the mood changes between tracks. Dragonslayer shifts from stately formality (""Silver Moons""), to heart-pounding new wave skitter (""Idiot Heart"") and anxious, head-over-heels tumbles (""Apollo and the Buffalo and Anna Anna Anna Oh!""), but it generates continuity between songs. Dragonslayer still centers on piano and keyboard, with Krug picking out (instead of pounding out) the tunes. ""You Go on Ahead (Trumpet Trumpet II)"" in particular boasts a beautifully clean melody. But this song-- like many Sunset Rubdown tracks-- gets more strident noisier as it moves. It's just that Dragonslayer moves forward with more finesse. Krug's lyrics feel, at first, as knotted and complex as ever. But now it's easier to draw connections and dig around for meanings. Thematically, this album has a lot in common with Random Spirit Lover, as Krug continues to sketch half-told tales of lovers or friends caught in their own recklessness. His lyrics seem formal, but with a natural twist. Krug obsesses over the rare and ephemeral: black swans, virgins, or paper lace, which either burns, fades, or ""crumples into ugly shapes"" (""Paper Lace""). What seems like a pile of metaphors is just Krug simplifying the world. Actions are products of instinct or fate, always out of our control, easier to describe than understand. It's Krug's way of-- perhaps insufficiently-- interpreting the world without fully taming it. Take ""Paper Lace"". It first appeared in sparse, hollow form on Swan Lake's Enemy Mine earlier this year. ""Those were good ideas, but they weren't diamonds and pearls,"" Krug sings while the drums laze to the ending. So his work wasn't done. Here he revamps it into a sinewy, shimmering form. Then there's ""Paper Lace""'s sly invitation: ""Come be a wild thing."" Krug knows things will end (badly), and secretly hopes that it is so. There's no doing laundry together, none of the city buses of Wolf Parade's ""Grounds for Divorce"", no beer runs in Dragonslayer's world. It's escapist fantasy fiction (though there's only one real dragon, right at the end). But, that's the way we're used to Sunset Rubdown sounding: fussy, untouchable, otherwordly. Let's not associate difficulty wih quality though. RSL had a greater chance for escape and awe;Â Dragonslayer was built for performance, and it sounds good live because the songs sound comfortable and straightforward. Sunset Rubdown are best when they are unfettered by those concerns, when they are fully soaked in their own set of thematic and sonic touchstones and could give a shit if they're understood or not.","The brooding, cryptic world of Spencer Krug is more straightforward on the latest Sunset Rubdown LP, the easiest to digest of the prolific writer's career.

Larry Jon Wilson,Larry Jon Wilson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e513d1975652138e07/1:1/w_160/d28430a0.jpg,2009-06-23 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13197-larry-jon-wilson/,Drag City,"Larry Jon Wilson was a late bloomer. Born in Georgia in 1940, he didn't learn to play guitar until he was 30, and he didn't go into music full-time until he was 34. He signed with Monument (Roy Orbison's former label) and released four well-praised albums in the late 1970s. During that time, he developed a reputation in Nashville as a songwriter's songwriter, with a robust voice and lyrics detailing his Southern upbringing. But his musical talent fueled a stubborn business-- or anti-business-- sensibility, and in 1980, he excused himself from the music industry, playing scattered shows and appearing on a few country comps over the next few decades. To call Wilson's new self-titled album on Drag City a comeback seems misleading: He had no hit albums and little notoriety beyond a small circle of admirers, and it's likely this record will yield no hits nor expand his popularity beyond a new generation of admirers. Besides, his time in the industry constitutes such a slight portion of his life that Larry Jon Wilson sounds less like a years-in-the-making follow-up than a culmination of the solo live shows he's been playing since before you were born. Co-producers Jerry DeCicca of the Black Swans and Jeb Loy Nichols recorded the album in Florida over the course of a week, essentially capturing Wilson in the rough: Working in a makeshift studio at a beachfront condo, he ran through a number of his own and others' songs, offering impromptu performances and creating on-the-spot medleys. It's just Wilson and his guitar, although Black Swan Noel Sayre overdubbed soft, subtle violin flourishes afterwards. Sadly, Larry Jon Wilson was Sayre's final recording before his death in 2008, and while he never showboats or even solos, his sensitivity to Wilson's performances on ""Me With No You"" and ""Rocking With You"" showcases a restrained and intuitive talent. The obvious comparisons here are to Johnny Cash's American Recordings and Neil Diamond's 12 Songs; Larry Jon Wilson shares an austerity and gravity with those albums, as if to suggest that, once a singer reaches a certain age, all he needs is a guitar and vox to put a song across. Where Rick Rubin infused Cash and Diamond's songs with a kind of performative formality, Wilson sounds much more casual here: This setting isn't a production decision, but his songs' natural state. Wilson's gravely voice and delicate fretwork lend opener ""Shoulders"" and ""Long About Now"" their stark intimacy, while his cover of Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson's ""Heartland"" evokes a quiet, even wistful outrage in its farmland lament. Part of the enjoyment of this album comes from hearing how Wilson's mind works-- not only how he resettles tunes into this setting, but more interestingly how he catches snippets of songs and sutures them into a medley. The 10-minute ""Whore Trilogy"" weaves together story-songs about hard-luck prostitutes and mistresses, each commenting on the others so that Wilson's tender empathy undercuts the harshness of the world he's evoking. But it's ""Losers Trilogy"" that stands out here, blending compositions by Stuart Wright and Mickey Newbury (best known for ""Just Dropped In [To See What Condition My Condition Was In]"") with one of Wilson's own. It's a long trek across hard land, culminating in a truly bleak finale: ""Things ain't what they used to be,"" he sings wearily, ""and probably never was."" Larry Jon Wilson carries the weight of experience, but this haunted album is no nostalgia trip, if only because Wilson knows nostalgia will get you absolutely nowhere.","Drag City releases the first album in decades from this singer and songwriter, whose comeback recalls the Rick Rubin-produced LPs of Johnny Cash.

Wild Young Hearts,Noisettes,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f5c0084474cd0c05e2/1:1/w_160/5174a34d.jpg,2009-06-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13212-wild-young-hearts/,Mercury,"Noisettes' first album, What's the Time, Mr. Wolf?, was much better in theory than execution. For every rager about pioneering gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe's deserved place in the pantheon, and for how much Noisettes singer Shingai Shoniwa channeled the rowdiest chicks to ever rock a mic, the strong magnetic lure of assembly-line modern rock pulled the album toward the same bland end of the spectrum that claimed CSS last year. But for their second album, Wild Young Hearts, the gang seems to have landed on ""Yeah Yeah Yeahs"" on the career-path-Wheel of Fortune, and chose to compress that trio's time frame-- sneaking in the dance jam with the ""Maps"" and ""Cheated Hearts"". Sure, Wild's cracks are still caulked in with variations of 2007's theme. But if Noisettes' goal for the album was to be better and more adventurous than the debut while retaining the awesomeness of their meal ticket frontwoman, they nailed it. At her best, Shoniwa establishes and then pushes through her fears, and her optimism and strong vocals combine to make opener ""Sometimes"" the band's best song yet. It's a simple folk piece with a sunny melody and optimistic disposition, but once it gets taken to church after the first chorus, it becomes clear that good things could happen if someone would introduce her to Mark Ronson. On their own, though, the band's retro-curiosity is more often than not matched with pop savvy, making for a solid record and a few downright good songs. ""Every Now and Then"", ""Never Forget You"", and ""24 Hours"" brush up effectively against 1960s soul, lacing in modern flourishes without overdoing them. The title track is a spry, jazzy singalong that, to its credit, stays on its tracks when the mall-punk guitars burst through the doors on the chorus. ""Atticus"" is a muted groover that lets Shoniwa get her Harper Lee on for a minute. For its part, latest single ""Saturday Night""... wait, is that a whiff of electroclash? No one's perfect, I guess, especially when they're trying to go from one-note to every note in the space of a single record. Sadly, though, that means that the dancier stuff, though I want to like it so much, is Wild's main casualty. Though everyone in the UK seems to love ""Don't Upset the Rhythm"", I can't get past the uninspiring use of citations. The title predicts its spiritual foundation, Rihanna's much hotter and not-yet-stale ""Don't Stop the Music"" (which itself isn't really reinventing the wheel). The title phrase shares space with the chant ""go baby, go baby, go!"", a geeky throwback to another pop-punk girl aiming to colonize the dancefloor. The song doesn't make me dance, or want to dance, as much as it makes me think of people dancing in television commercials. But hey, Noisettes are young, and especially if their third album represents as much of a leap over the second as Wild does from Wolf, they'll nail it soon enough. The onus is on Shoniwa, though: Once she overcomes the fundamental irony of possessing a strong visual and vocal presence without a coherent identity, there's no way we'll be able to stop her.","Former UK buzz band follows its so-so debut with a record that is both better and more adventurous than its first.

Liquor Store Mascot,Playboy Tre,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f6b1335d7bf1698ab0/1:1/w_160/da39fcb4.jpg,2009-06-23 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13213-liquor-store-mascot/,self-released,"Playboy Tre has been toiling in Atlanta's rap underground for nearly 10 years, and unless you are following one of the handful of regional-rap blogs that are championing him, you've probably never heard his name before. He spent some time running with the Youngbloodz and recorded an album with one-time Lil Jon signee Bohagon that was never released, but these days he mostly pays the bills selling hooks to more-successful rappers (T.I.'s ""Slide Show"", for example) alongside his also-way-more-famous compatriot Bobby Ray (aka B.o.B.). His long list of setbacks seems to have both humbled and focused him, however, and over the past year, he has released two increasingly ambitious and introspective full-length mixtapes full of all-original beats that grapple honestly and engagingly with his growing despair and frustration. Last year'sÂ Goodbye America was a bitter farewell to a country that had done nothing for him, whileÂ Liquor Store Mascot is an even more personal affair, detailing his struggles with alcohol. His frivolous rap name is a remnant of his more carefree youth, and it feels like a misnomer now; he can be hilarious, but Playboy Tre is emphatically not playing. On ""Before I Go"", he lays it all on the table: ""I'm the man behind the raps, but I'm way older than your average/ Fuck, I'm in my thirties, got a nephew named Josh, another nephew named Dave who I'd kill for any day/ And I don't have kids even though I'm past due/ Said I'd never do abortion, but I did that shit, too."" This kind of disarming candor is what helps makeÂ Liquor Store Mascot a memorable tour of the view from Tre's barstool. ""I ain't scared to tell the world I'm a drunk, man, cuz this is me,"" he raps on the title track, the perfectly phrased and delivered chorus of which goes, ""You know I do it for the have-nots/ And keep an ice-cold beer like I'm the liquor store mascot."" His fondness for booze, and the self-deprecating way he raps it, have led to some Devin the Dude comparisons, which is a fair starting point, but the different between Devin and Playboy is also the difference between a stoner and a drunk; even when he gets dark, Devin never seems more than a beat or two away from dissolving into giggles, where as even when Tre's joking, the tension and buried hurt is audible in his voice. Part of this comes from the Georgia salt of his accent, but it's also in the flatly nasal, sardonic way he wields it: ""Lord bless theÂ people at theÂ bottom of theÂ bottle, word to Gil Scott,"" he raps on ""Living in the Bottle"", spitting out each syllable through gritted teeth over an interpolation of Heron's ""The Bottle"". Like all drunks, his recollections are equally funny and sad: ""Pop hit that liquor, his attitude would switch up/ Started kicking niggas out, and tell 'em, 'take that ugly bitch with ya'"", he remembers later on ""Bottle"". Luckily, Tre doesn't devote the whole mixtape rapping about drinking. On ""Sideways"", he brings the same narrative clarity and immediacy to recounting dead-end meetings with record executives and staying up till 4 a.m. trying to write songs in a bare apartment. On ""Oh My Lord Freestyle"", he kicks hilariously nasty sex raps and swagger over uptempo gospel clapping. And on the powerfully evocative ""Bleachers"", he raps with breathless reverence over an echoing ""boom-boom clap"" beat and a single ghostly keyboard about staying late at school, ""in an empty gym, beatin' on bleachers, trying to get my lyrics right."" Â The song captures the simple joy of rhyming so beautifully-- ""I got a song that the block 'bout to hear tonight!"" he crows at one point-- that it should warm the heart of even the most cantankerous hip-hop nerd. As mentioned, the mixtape is composed of all original beats, and truly, if Tre can put together a record this appealing and sonically varied for free with no record deal, than no one with even a paltry label budget behind them has the slightest excuse anymore. ""Liquor Store Mascot"", produced by Phantom, piles Mannie Fresh trumpet fanfares over Shawty Redd-style pizzicato strings; ""If This World Was Mine"" is a warm chipmunk-soul loop worthy of pre-College Dropout Kanye; and ""Livin In the Bottle""'s Gil Scott-Heron sample is lush and seamless enough to recall ""Stay Fly"". ""Everybody's Lookin for Something"" even manages to find a fresh angle on the Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"". Sure, there is a slightly cheesy song with Bobby Ray about how we are all like robots, really, when you think about it, and yeah, ""Remember Me"" features a hook sung by who I'm pretty sure is the lead singer of Evanescence, but for the most part, Playboy Tre has managed, with no label support, pu [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| blicist, or backing of any kind, to release one of the most resonant rap albums, independent or not, of the year so far.

Far,Regina Spektor,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4cec0084474cd0c058f/1:1/w_160/b2c0d9cd.jpg,2009-06-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13184-far/,Sire,"Regina Spektor is 29 years old. I point this out because on her newest album, Far, Spektor alternately imitates dolphin noises, talks about making a computer out of macaroni pieces, and fashions a refrain out of repetitions of the non-word ""eet."" And that's just within the first four songs. Over the course of three proper studio albums and various other tangential releases, Regina Spektor has demonstrated a solid sense of popcraft and an occasional ability to capture slices of life in charmingly non-conventional ways. More to the point, however, she's displayed an unstinting weakness for intensely self-regarding cuteness and overplayed naÃ¯vetÃ©. Despite being closer to her 40th birthday than her Sweet 16, Spektor continues to romp wide-eyed through her compositions like Sally Hawkins' perennially cheery Poppy character from the Mike Leigh film Happy-Go-Lucky. Spektor is buoyed on Far by the assistance of four top-flight producers, including Mike Elizondo (Dr. Dre, Eminem), Jacknife Lee (Bloc Party, Snow Patrol) and, oh yeah, Jeff Freaking Lynne. As you'd expect from such an impressive roll call, the album's sonics are exceptionally clean and tastefully tailored, from Lynne's moving string swells on ""Blue Lips"" to the eminently radio-friendly hook on the Elizondo-helmed ""The Calculation"" to the Beatles-y brass touches on ""Two Birds"" (courtesy, surprisingly enough, not of Lynne but of Lee). Unfortunately, all this talent behind the boards often feels like a waste because of Spektor's inability to let her songs stand on their own merits without the persistent interjection of vocal curlicues or verbal flights of fancy. Notice how she ladles awful oversinging onto ""Blue Lips"" and ""Human of the Year"", or tries to put on some kind of robo-Germanic accent for the refrain to the horribly lumbering ""Machine"". I have no doubt these little whimsical flourishes go over like gangbusters in concert, but on a fifth or 10th or 20th listen to a studio album, how many people are really not going to cringe at these affectations? Certainly it's easy to chalk up these eccentricities to Spektor's quirky ""personality"" (which belongs in scare quotes because god knows being quirky doesn't guarantee you have an interesting personality), but frequently they feel like a defense mechanism as well. After all, cuteness is a terrific tool for allowing anyone to get away with being trite, which probably goes a long way towards explaining why a song like the first single, ""Laughing With"", seems almost trenchant at first blush, yet upon closer scrutiny unravels into pure meaningless mush, a nattering scold that woefully misreads atheism and agnosticism, ticking off a list of boilerplate crises (war, poverty, a missing child) and reminding us that no one laughs at God in these situations, as though non-believers spend the majority of their tragedy-free time busting on the Almighty. ""Dance Anthem of the 80's"" is emblematic of Spektor flashing genuine wit and emotional power yet being unable to get out of her own way. At one point Spektor almost off-handedly intones, ""And it's been a long time since before I've been touched/ Now I'm getting touched all the time,"" and it's an undeniably stirring moment, yet it never has a chance to thrive, not when it's contending with Spektor mawkishly cooing, ""you are so sweet,"" while stretching and trilling the word ""sleep"" at the end of each refrain to an almost unbelievably obnoxious degree. I like to imagine that somewhere 19-year-old Taylor Swift hears this song and shakes her head, wondering when Regina Spektor is ever going to grow up.","Arrested development and affectation continues to define Regina Spektor's quirky music-making. An all-star roll of producers are on hand, including Jeff Lynne.

God Help the Girl,God Help the Girl,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4805e6ef959693208b6/1:1/w_160/ef087fec.jpg,2009-06-23 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13112-god-help-the-girl/,Matador,"""Girl singer needed for autumnal recording project,"" the ad in the paper said. ""Autumnal,"" of course, being the Queen's-- and the critics'-- preferred English for, uh, ""fall-like."" You know that song where, when people talk about the fall, Jens Lekman thinks they're talking about Mark E. Smith? Stuart Murdoch probably thinks they're talking about the Garden of Eden. After all, the main character in God Help the Girl-- a new album of songs from the Belle and Sebastian singer/songwriter's planned musical-film project-- is called Eve. She's voiced angelically by Catherine Ireton, cover girl for the Scottish septet's ""White Collar Boy"" single and one half of a sleepy acoustic pop duo called the Go Away Birds. Ireton is one of nine singers (incuding the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon) joining members of Belle and Sebastian for the recording, and her Irish-Zooey-Deschanel-next-door vocals have ended up gracing 10 of the set's 14 songs. But not until after an internet-wide sing-off. ""The competition was me showing a startling lack of faith in what was right in front of me, but I had to see what was out there,"" Murdoch recently told London's Guardian. From the humble school project that became 1996 debut Tigermilk to the professional pop majesty of The Life Pursuit a decade later, the Scottish pop savant's work has been almost one leap of faith after another. Murdoch lands on solid ground again with God Help the Girl, which has catchy, jangling girl-group ditties aplenty, a little theatrical flourish thanks to Belle and Sebastian trumpeter Mick Cooke's orchestral arrangements, and at least one typically Murdoch-esque character, Eve. The imagery is always vivid, even when the plot isn't. From what I can tell, Ireton's bookish ingenue gives herself to the Holy Trinity: sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. God love 'er. Always one for evocative character sketches, Murdoch clearly relishes his role as demiurge of God Help the Girl's self-contained universe. First single ""Come Monday Night"" is a good preview, with the wispy lilt of early Camera Obscura and a way of lingering on ""the gray of ordinariness"" long enough to show how it's lined with silvery subtleties. Like, that restless first evening between a disappointing weekend and another drab workday. The way sleep leaves a face ""crumpled and creased."" And the full rundown of Eve obsessing over some guy she likes (""Please stop me there, I'm even boring myself!"").Â At times, Murdoch's realistically elaborate fiction points to its own phoniness. ""Life could be musical comedy,"" suggests ""Hiding Neath My Umbrella"", a bittersweet Murdoch-Ireton duet over waltzing piano and swelling strings. God Help the Girl opens with a delicate new version of The Life Pursuit centerpiece ""Act of the Apostle II"". Switched from ""senior year"" to ""senior ward,"" and re-titled simply ""Act of the Apostle"", the song also drops its last verse-- making the whole thing more prologue-like-- and gains a bit of Andrews Sisters swing. For all the specifics about a sick narrator and fighting parents, ""Act of the Apostle"" is still essentially a pop kid's update of the Velvet Underground's ""Rock and Roll"": ""My Damascan road's my transistor radio."" Her life was saved by girl groups. Or was it? The nuance-rich Murdoch is characteristically coy when it comes to certain details.Â He's mentioned musicals such asÂ Jesus Christ Superstar or the originalÂ Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory film as inspirations; my fellow 1980s babies may remember Whoopi Goldberg inÂ Sister Act, where all those awesome Motown songs turned out to make real nice hymns if you did the ol' Christian rock trick and replaced ""him"" with ""Him"". SoÂ The Life Pursuit's ""Funny Little Frog"", sung here by Internet contest winner Brittany Stallings, might not work as a soul song, but just think: a soul song. About someone who is everywhere, but you don't think of in a physical way. Someone you might go and visit on rainy Sundays. ""She was into S&M and Bible studies,"" Murdoch once sang. Eve's first romantic experience is creepy, Murdoch offering to rub and scrub her during the ironically formal strings and piano of ""Pretty Eve in the Tub"". No wonder she winds up in the arms of Hannon's hammy rake on ""Perfection as a Hipster"", asking for haircare tips even as she wastes away from lack of nutrition. Asya, of Seattle teen keyboard-drums trio Smoosh, may have an even more girlish voice than Ireton's, but on ""I Just Want Your Jeans"", she's looking for boys to make her ""go, 'Ouch!'""-- heck, she's ""open to dark surprises."" And somewhere in there I just skipped a couple of totally skippable instrumentals. The last two songs are among the album's most inspired. ""I'll Have to Dance With Cassie"" suggests Eve has returned to the church of rock'n'roll; now that she knows her ""dream boy"" doesn't exist, she's shimmying with a girl friend like they're a pair of boxing kangaroos. On closing number ""A Down and Dusky Blonde"", having ""fried"" her head-- another double entendre?-- Eve joins an entire sisterhood of female singers. She hasn't been getting her apple a day, so a doctor counsels, ""A woman does not live by the printed word/ Forgive yourself, and eat."" How about it, Eve? ""I need a friend and I choose you,"" the final song continues, with a vow to ""forget the kiss and feel."" Hmm. God Help the Girl is a spirited expansion of some of Murdoch's best ideas, but until the film finishes shooting-- set to start next year-- we'll probably just have wild-ass guesses like mine as to the real story. ""I feel like I have God for a pal because no one else would have me,"" Murdoch writes in an online journal entry. ""Maybe that's the basis for a lot of religion. He's the invisible friend that it's OK to have as an adult."" Tell you this much, He's in the details.","Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch plays pop svengali on theÂ singer/songwriter's planned musical-film project. The Divine Comedy guests.

Sholi,Sholi,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a444ea9e61561daa4e7b/1:1/w_160/d8b527a0.jpg,2009-06-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13060-sholi/,Quarterstick,"Payam Bavafa, Sholi's guitarist and lead singer, has called the band's self-titled debut a meditation on ""the perversion of truth by memory"" in interviews and cited his time analyzing brainwaves for a neuroscience research company as an influence on his lyrics. The album's producer is Greg Saunier from Deerhoof, who took on the band after Bavafa sent him some demos, including ""Hejrat"", their reinterpretation of a song by the controversial Iranian pop singer Googoosh. (The ""Hejrat"" 7"" landed Sholi in the 2008 Music Issue of The Believer.) Live, they are given to performing epic renditions of Joanna Newsom's ""Sprout and the Bean"". Translation: these are some brainy fellows, and if all of this background info didn't adequately prepare you for an album of proggy guitar suites with constantly shifting time signatures, then you probably just weren't paying close enough attention. Luckily, as far as proggy guitar suites go, these are some lovely, liquid compositions. ""All That We Can See"" opens the album with a perfumed gust of sound, as drummer Jonathon Bafus tosses little fills everywhere like sputtering wires, and then a guitar line vaguely reminiscent of Radiohead's ""Knives Out"" surfaces. From there, the song shifts abruptly from acoustic strumming to full-bore jamming to round-robin vocal chanting, but the descending guitar figure holds everything together, the rhythmic and harmonic anchor tugging the song to Earth as it threatens, repeatedly, to float away. This back-and-forth between structure and aimlessness characterizes most of Sholi, which accounts for both its strengths and its weaknesses. The way the album is sequenced-- more a series of interrelated vignettes than songs, each track melting quietly into the next-- gives the album a nicely hazy, lucid-dream quality. The problem, simply put, is that most every song sounds the same. Sholi are clearly aiming for an immersive experience, but it can't be a good sign that I had to keep shaking myself to note the vanishing points between songs, or that I had to isolate ""November Through June"" five or six times to realize it was the one with the catchy chorus. Bavafa's limpid, somewhat bland tenor unfortunately contributes to the eye-glaze factor. For all the vitality of the music-- whether it's Bafus subdividing beats into hailstorms of counter-rhythms on ""Dance for Hours"" or the doleful waltz of ""Spy in the House of Memories""-- Bavafa's mournful singing, which never alters tone or grain, does a pretty thorough job of smoothing it all out. Bafus is the band's secret weapon; his rhythmically restless and effortlessly virtuosic drumming manages to power the songs single-handedly and somehow paradoxically stay out of their way. And Bavafa has a good chemistry with him, building an improbably feather-light song on top of his clomping, stop-start 5/4 beat on ""Tourniquet"". But when Bafus isn't pushing from the back, everything falls slack, and the album blurs into gray. Individual moments stand out, but Sholi isn't an album you immerse yourself in as much as notice from time to time.","An album of proggy guitar suites with constantly shifting time signatures from a brainy band that covered Joanna Newsom last year.

Born on Flag Day,Deer Tick,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47b5e6ef959693208aa/1:1/w_160/5a997866.jpg,2009-06-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13107-born-on-flag-day/,Partisan,"The strangest but most fortuitous moment of Deer Tick's young career occurred recently when the band was chosen by ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams as the first interview subject of his fledgling web-only music-spotlight feature, ""BriTunes"". Offering a humbling reminder of how awkward any of us can be when we step outside our comfort zones, Williams seemed infinitely more stilted and out-of-sorts querying four scruffily reticent young roots-rockers than he does when sitting down with the leader of the free world. As for Deer Tick, the profile could very well be a major boon, not simply because of Williams' fame and visibility, but even more because of his age and the assumed demographic of his target audience. The band may be made up of young dudes (most notably 23-year-old frontman Joseph McCauley III), but they make a very classicist-friendly brand of rock that would seem likely to appeal to the 35-54 set. But trust me when I say that my ambivalence towards Deer Tick's sophomore release, Born on Flag Day, has nothing to do with me being a slave to the flavor of the week, not when I was so enthralled earlier this year with another recent ""BriTunes"" pick, Jason Isbell. Deer Tick's primary shortcoming is that the band evokes authentically gutty music from the past without noticeably inserting much of themselves into the equation, achieving superficial mimesis and comforting recognition while failing to put their own stamp on their creations. In fairness, one aspect of Deer Tick's sound does feel singular, though not in a very positive way. McCauley's voice is a nasally whine undercut with a harsh, grating buzz-- you can almost visualize it emerging from his mouth with actual serrated edges. On bare-bones tracks ""Song About a Man"" and ""Friday XIII"", the effect is almost painful, and hence Deer Tick are at their best when the band is competing for decibels with their vocalist, in the orchestral swells of ""Smith Hill"" or the stumbling sock-hop shimmy of the album-opening ""Easy"". Even then, the effect rarely rises above revivalism, though Deer Tick do at least have the good sense and taste to evoke a fairly healthy range of influences-- country-rock may be the default mode here thanks to the bevy of Southern-leaning grooves and roadhouse-poet lyrics like, ""Tonight I see my sweetheart/ I've got a 50 dollar bill,"" and ""Drank away all the things I could provide."" But there are almost as many 1960s pop turns here as well, from the Brit Invasion shuffle the band locks into near the end of ""Little White Lies"" to the Byrdsian countermelodies of ""Hell on Earth"". Only when Deer Tick really tunnel into one specific sound or style do they flirt with purely unappealing shtick, particularly the barroom greaser rave-up ""Straight Into a Storm"" and McCauley's unsuccessful bid for John Prine-ish wryness on ""Friday XIII"". And then Born on Flag Day ends with probably the most egregious classicist move of all, the tried-and-true hidden track-- and it's a lo-fi cover of ""Good Night, Irene""! You can even hear bottles clanking and girls chatting in the background, reminding us that yes, this is just a totally laid-back, spontaneous moment of dudes sitting around strumming their acoustics. Such familiar moves might be tolerable if the tunes on Born on Flag Day were more fun, but ""dutiful"" is often the most applicable adjective here.","On their second album, the rootsy rockers profiled by NBC's Brian Williams evoke a fairly healthy range of influences but run into some familiar problems.

Because I Was in Love,Sharon Van Etten,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a507b1335d7bf1698add/1:1/w_160/685d14e4.jpg,2009-06-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13226-because-i-was-in-love/,Language of Stone,"Fans of acoustic guitar-playing female singer-songwriters are so flooded with options these days that they are in the position to be pretty discriminating. Artists such as Alela Diane, Marissa Nadler, Jana Hunter, and Mariee Sioux have issued a steady stream of quality music, and have collectively set a fairly high standard for newcomers to match. Yet on her debut full-length album, Because I Was in Love, Brooklyn's Sharon Van Etten proves that she has the expressive voice and the songwriting chops to ably hold her own in the company of her peers. As with the aforementioned artists, Van Etten's work retains some echoes of folk tradition but generally operates in a more personal, introspective space. Following a number of hand-designed and self-released recordings, a 2008 tour with Meg Baird brought Van Etten into the orbit of Philadelphia's Espers, whose Greg Weeks recorded Because I Was in Love at Hexham Head studio. With Weeks' veteran assistance, Van Etten keeps the album's arrangements minimal and direct, augmenting her voice and guitar with only the occasional splash of organ, brushed cymbals, or multi-tracked vocal harmonies. Though the arrangements are spare, the performances on Because I Was in Love are not skeletal-- these are full-bodied songs that sound finished, as though Van Etten had already lived with this material long enough to know intuitively how best to present it. In this regard Van Etten's work can resemble Chan Marshall's earliest Cat Power recordings, especially in the way that Van Etten's confident, nuanced soprano is able to help temper the emotional fragility of her material. As the title suggests, Because I Was In Love spends most of its time chronicling the bittersweet ache and light-headed confusion that can only arise through the ebbs and flows of romance. Unlike some low-key vocalists who prefer to sing as if nobody were listening, Van Etten instead sings these songs as though she had an audience of one, with nearly every lyric directed straight to some unnamed ""you."" And, at the risk of conflating the performer with her performance, suffice to say that throughout the album Van Etten really nails it, sounding every bit like someone trying to get her head around a complex and evolving relationship. On opener ""I Wish I Knew"" or the sumptuous ""Much More Than That"", Van Etten writes with such intimacy (her lyrics filled with direct lines like, ""I wish I knew what to do with you,"" or ""Please don't take me lightly"") that the listener gets an almost disconcerting sense of eavesdropping on a private conversation. Elsewhere, as on ""Tornado"" or the captivating ""Consolation Prize"", Van Etten sounds more reflective, keeping a measured distance from her narratives, even if her songs' ultimate conclusions (""The moral of the story is don't lie to me again"") recognize the impossibility of pat endings and easy solutions. Most crucial to the album's success, however, is Van Etten's unerring sense for crafting memorable, seductive melodies. Here again she takes no shortcuts, as she largely forgoes standard verse-chorus repetition in favor of a more organic style, with wonderful songs like ""For You"" and ""Holding Out"" gently unwinding like the lines across a hand-drawn road map. Even in a folk scene that can sometimes feel over-crowded, Because I Was in Love positions Sharon Van Etten immediately towards the front of the pack.","Brooklyn's Sharon Van Etten displays the expressive voice and songwriting chops of peers such asÂ Alela Diane, Marissa Nadler, and Jana Hunter.

Murdering Oscar (and Other Love Songs),Patterson Hood,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47aea9e61561daa4ef8/1:1/w_160/17f63f8a.jpg,2009-06-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13106-murdering-oscar-and-other-love-songs/,Ruth St.,"Patterson Hood's a prolific songwriter, cranking out tunes at a relatively rapid clip, premiering them at solo shows, and posting them to his site. But team player that he is, there's only so much space for Hood's material on each Drive-By Truckers disc, making room for partner in crime Mike Cooley and now contributions from bassist Shonna Tucker as well. It's a balance that pays off, too: last year's Brighter Than Creation's Dark was sprawling and diverse-- and possibly the group's best record. Still, there's the matter of that backlog of songs, andÂ churningÂ out solo albums doesn't seem to be Hood's M.O. But even if it were, saying you're going to get it done apparently doesn't make doing it any easier. Hood's ostensible solo debut, 2004's Killers and Stars, was made three years before its belated release, as a form of what Hood branded ""therapy."" Yet that's nothing compared to the set of songs that comprise Murdering Oscar (and Other Love Songs), Hood's second album, whose origins stretch back even further than his previous solo disc. One case in point: ""Heavy and Hanging"", which was written in response to Kurt Cobain's 1994 suicide. That year also marked Hood's relocation to Athens, Georgia, from his home in Alabama, setting in motion the events that would lead to the Drive-By Truckers. Plenty of things have happened to Hood since then, including a new marriage, fatherhood, and the gradual success of the DBTs, and all these things inform Murdering Oscar to some degree. Even the musicians backing Hood offer a sort of career overview, from fellow Truckers Brad Morgan, Cooley, and Tucker and longtime associate John NeffÂ to producer and Athens staple David Barbe to frequent tourmates Will Johnson and Scott Danbom of Centro-matic, and finally to dad David Hood, legendary Muscle Shoals session bassist. Even the name of Hood's new label, Ruth St., refers to the address of the apartment he and a friend shared when he first moved to Georgia and began work on this record some 15 years ago. That said, this is hardly the stuff of either nostalgia or what one imagines a Truckers disc full of Hood-only songs would sound like. To his credit Hood has collected 13 tracks that, for whatever reason, hang together well. If anything, the title track (inspired by Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors) and ""Heavy and Hanging"" (which is paired with the Crazy Horse-y ""Walking Around Sense"", which may be taking aim at Courtney Love's parenting skills) are among the album's darker moments. The rest largely feature Hood sometimes mirthful, sometimes rueful, but always surprisingly sanguine, even mature, in the way he addresses life's ups and downs. ""Pollyanna"", for example, the oldest song on the album, was written as Hood realized his marriage and band Adam's House Cat (which he formed with Cooley before the two reconnected in the Truckers) were both falling apart, but the song's a genial classic rock nugget, while ""Foolish Young Bastard"", a put-down aimed at an old manager, comes off oddly forgiving and c'est la vie optimistic rather than mean-spirited. ""Screwtopia"" was written as a sardonic portrait of suburban domestic tranquility, and seems almost wistful (at least until Hood suggests his hypothetical wife take a few more pills to ease her worries, and gives his son a loaded gun to play with). On the domestic front, Hood's life has turned out better than he predicted all those years ago, at least if his post-marriage and fatherhood tracks are any indication. The moving ""Pride of the Yankees"" is Hood throwing his protective arms around his newborn child in a post-9/11 world, while ""Grandaddy"" finds him fast forwarding several more years to a time when he can spoil his future descendants with candy hidden around the house. The poppy ""I Understand Now"" is Hood happy and content, ""She's a Little Randy"" is Hood in a silly (and, um, sexy) mood, and ""Back of a Bible"" is a love song to his wife the singer literally scribbled in the final blank pages of a motel's good book while out on tour. Nothing here totally upends what we already know of Hood's talents via the Truckers, but it does serve as a supplementaryÂ  capsule capturing how he ticks, right down to his cover of the Runt-era Todd Rundgren proto alt-country gem ""The Range War"", a response to anyone that, in Hood's words, thinks all he does is ""sit around and listen to Molly Hatchet."" What it and the originals on Murdering Oscar do is emphasize Hood's respect for and attraction to lyrical and emotional honestly above all else, the universals that have linked a lot of good music from the past to present. With every note, with every song, Hood sounds like he increasingly, if modestly, recognizes he's part of that great songwriting continuum, working hard to live up to his end of the obligation, as long as it takes.","Drive-By Trucker's second solo album features many songs written years ago, but the whole still hangs together and comes across as cohesive and sharp.

Farm,Dinosaur Jr.,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47dc0084474cd0c04d4/1:1/w_160/82d84177.jpg,2009-06-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13109-farm/,Jagjaguwar,"Beyond, the first album to feature the original Dinosaur Jr. lineup since their 1980s heyday, was so surprisingly good it was tempting to call it a fluke. Tempting, but wrong-- two years after its release, it still sounds great, on par with the early, hallowed triumvirate of Dinosaur, You're Living All Over Me, and Bug. For any cynics still chalking Beyond up to luck, Farm should blast the scales from your jaded eyes. Energetic, confident, and catchy, it's even more compelling thanÂ Beyond. It certainly boasts more stick-in-your-head tunes than Beyond, or virtually any other Dinosaur Jr. album. Who knows why J Mascis writes better songs when Lou Barlow and Murph are around-- maybe there's something to the old clichÃ© of ""chemistry,"" maybe the pair just know how to push his tunes from solid up to stellar. But whatever creates this spark, it's spurred Mascis to pack Farm with riff-heavy slacker classics that rival past gems like ""Little Fury Things"" and ""Freak Scene"". Opener ""Pieces"" is a vintage display of Dinosaur Jr.'s knack for grafting unruly riffage to unabashedly bittersweet choruses. The lumbering ""I Want You to Know"" follows with chunky chords that sound both heavy and bright. As David Raposa pointed out in his recent track review, the tune is impressively assured, as if Mascis has shed the need to add an apologetic tone to his guitar anthems. But even when Mascis is lyrically mopey, the music pulls this sad sack up off the couch. Take the caffeinated chug of slacker-self-help guide ""Over It"". ""Can I make it here?/ Get over it,"" Mascis tells himself. ""I've been feeling weird/ Get over it... I've been on the fence/ Now it's making sense I see."" Even better is the pity-filled ""Plans"". The man who Thurston Moore imagined as Slacker President in Sonic Youth's ""Teen Age Riot"" moans about pain, loss, and apathy-- ""I've got nothing left to be/ Do you have some plans for me?"" But the music's adrenalized bounce makes his misery more sweet than sad. In Farm's world, a good melody cures all ills. As catchy and well-crafted as these songs are, they never feel restricted or overly polished. Each track is given room to grow, stretching into extended intros, impulsive solos, and oft-repeated verses. The result is both shapely and sprawling, like the mossy cartoon characters on the album cover. The aching ""Said the People"" seems to climax with Mascis' crying solo in the middle, but then spreads out into another great three minutes. ""I Don't Wanna Go There"" sprawls into fuzzy detonations, like a mellowed version of Bug's noise-bomb ""Don't"". And Barlow approaches his two excellent songs with similar openness, hitting especially hard on the dark ""Your Weather"". With Farm coming out around the same time as the first installment in Neil Young's Archive**s project, it's tempting to make a grand statement about Mascis and Dinosaur Jr. as heirs to the Young and Crazy Horse throne. Young's genius is pretty inimitable, but there is something about this band-- the way they mix noisy guitar and punk-ish slam with sugared melodies and faded choruses-- that's Young-worthy. And as long as J, Lou, and Murph keep shooting as high as Farm, they'll end up with the kind of discography worth buying over and over again.","Looks like Beyond was not a fluke: the latest from the reunited original line-up is jammed with well-crafted songs that never feel overly polished.

Some Sweet Relief,Speck Mountain,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a397b1335d7bf1698770/1:1/w_160/fa2ee04d.jpg,2009-06-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12915-some-sweet-relief/,Carrot Top,"Speck Mountain's 2007 debut, Summer Above, was a pleasant but indistinct set of spacey, drifting songs. The Chicago quartet's individual elements-- particularly the Hope Sandoval-ish vocals of Marie-Claire Balabanian and the syrupy bass of Karl Briedrick-- were solid. But there was something passive about the proceedings. Thoroughly relaxed and mellow, the album suggested that not only could Speck Mountain do this in their sleep, but they'd prefer to. As Some Sweet Relief's opening tracks waft from the speakers, Speck Mountain seem content to continue that passivity. Agreeable melodies, swaying tempos, and reverberating chords float by, sprinkling sonic dust on your eyelids. That drowsy mood persists in the lyrics of track four, ""I Feel Eternal"". ""Close your eyes/ Let your dreams pass my way,"" hums a meditative Balabanian. But musically, things have changed. With its bending bassline, chiming lead guitar, and horn-section accents, ""I Feel Eternal"" gives the album a gentle but tangible kick, one that propels the band forward the rest of the way. This subtle ascension seems to come from an injection of soul. As Some Sweet Relief progresses, song structures lean toward the realm of spirituals and blues, and Balabanian's supine purr begins to feel more classic. You won't mistake Speck Mountain for a gospel group, but it's fair to say that, at least during the album's second half, they sound more like Spiritualized than Mazzy Star. Take the phasey organ of the aching ""Backslider"", which seems ghostwritten by Sonic Boom, or the slow croon of its partner track ""Backsliding"", whose staircase-climb has a distinct Jason Pierce tint circa ""Shine a Light"". It all leads to another sharp peak, ""Twinlines"", whose simple chorus-- ""Oh, how long,"" delivered in a pretty Balabanian moan-- belongs distinctly to this band. Speck Mountain still have some distance to travel before they fill an album with such moments, so that whenever you hear their music, you think of them first rather than their influences. But this is only their second full-length, and it's a solid step in that direction. Though they seem dedicated to their musical equivalent of lying on the grass and looking for shapes in the clouds, there's no law that says mellowness can't reach as high as energy-- especially when, as with Speck Mountain, it's permanently aimed towards the sky.","Chicago quartet follows its pleasant yet indistinct debut with a record that points toward the work of Spiritualized and Mazzy Star.

The Camel's Back,Psapp,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45cb1335d7bf1698936/1:1/w_160/95b92920.jpg,2009-06-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13081-the-camels-back/,Domino,"Have you actually had an appletini, or do you just make jokes about people who drink appletinis? There's your litmus test for Psapp's The Camel's Back: If you answered yes to the first bit, you will probably dig it, while those who fall under the latter category will most likely have a hard time getting past the record's sloe gin fizz. I'm a High Life man myself, but have you ever had an appletini? They're sort of delicious. Ditto Psapp; sure, they're awfully swank and sultry and sound like the auditory equivalent of sinking into a high-backed leather couch, but when it's done right, it can be a nice change from keying High Lifes out back. See, Psapp play what's essentially cocktail jazz music with a strong indie-pop lean, the kind of thing that you'd expect to stumble onto in some red-tinted lounge with the $13 fruit-laden beverages and lots of sexy people doing sexy things. The jazzy side of Psapp's ""toytronica""-- an unfortunate but oddly sticky qualifier for Psapp's glitchy production style-- is played up to fine effect on The Camel's Back, while the clink-and-clank of the music has been streamlined a smidge to help push the songs (rather than the sounds) to the forefront. Sure, there's the occasional plunk of a child's piano or the wheeze of a mini-accordion, but with its sophisticated structures overwhelming its occasional grass-stained dressings, this is hardly kids play-- hell, Galia Durant and Carim Classman have grown since 2006's The Only Thing I Ever Wanted. Opener and highlight ""I Want That"" gets the the ball rolling; the song whooshes by like a couple of passing trains, as vocalist Galia Durant makes her empassioned plea for whatever ""that"" is. Durant's spirited singing is, as ever, Psapp's great strength, her voice clear and expressive through all the precise, occasionally passionless tittering behind her. No matter the tune, Durant gets it over, and it's fun to hear her jump from flat and stonefaced (""Fickle Ghost"") to sing-songy (""The Monster Song"", which, awesomely, is about monsters) without missing a beat. Not that you'd miss them anyway. Durant and Classman have toned down the so-called ""toytronica"" flourishes big-time, which makes The Camel's Back their most dynamic and, in a way, lushest record to date: there's less going on, but more to actually hear, since this time out the production's warm and open rather than cluttered and, as a result, quashed. That's great for ""I Want That"" and the Wes Anderson soundtracky instrumental ""Marshrat"" and quite a few others, but when there's less to the tracks but the tunes and Durant's voice, you start to notice the cracks in the faÃ§ade. A good lot of these tunes gallop at approximately the same pace, and while Durant's can be an awfully sly lyrical wit, she's not always, so roughly half of The Camel's Back rides by on sputter and swoon without much in the way of song behind it. Psapp have plenty of tricks up their shiny sleeves, but only rarely on The Camel's Back-- ""I Want That"", ""Mister Ant"", ""Part Like Waves"", the gorgeous ""Screws""-- do they pull them all out at once. It's always pleasant, but it only rarely pulls you in; like I said, good background music. ""Screws"" is the outlier among the highlights; it's a piano ballad stripped bare until its last few seconds, and holy hell, is it ever gorgeous. Durant's less-cyborgy-Laetitia Sadier pipes are well showcased, and Psapp prove that they don't need all that twinkling and tinkering to crank out a good one. It's followed by the brief ""Homicide"", all clock-innards boing, which serves mostly to annoy before the slurry, Squirrel Nut Zippery ""Parker"" closes things out, but the contrast between the two tracks is striking; the one proves something Psapp have somewhat stubbornly avoided their whole career to this point-- writing a fine song without a lot of bells and whistles-- while the other seems impatient to get said bells and whistles on wax after a brief respite and builds a track (albeit a short one) around 'em. Psapp are certainly getting closer to achieving a perfect balance in their sound, and The Camel's Back is certainly lounge jazz of a higher proof than most, but save perhaps ""I Want That"", ""Screws"" is the one number here that'd make you put down your drink. Here's hoping Durant and Classman add a few more like it to their repertoire next time out.","Psapp play what's essentially cocktail jazz music with a strong indie-pop lean, occasionally hitting on something gorgeous.

This time out, Bishop jettisons the guitar soli approach that's defined the majority of his solo stuff. But he does so only after first clobbering the listener with a magnificent example of the form, ""Taqasim For Omar"". The Omar in question on this particular guitar improvisation is the late Egyptian guitarist Omar Khorshid, whom Bishop credits in interviews as a major inspiration for this whole project. One minute into the second track, ""Enta Omri"", we're introduced to the Freak of Araby Ensemble, where they tastefully lay down tablas, bass, and doubled-up guitar until the final number, ""Blood-Stained Sands"", which is all reeds (Moroccan chanter horns) and percussion. Half the songs on The Freak of Araby are covers of Middle Eastern tunes, and the other half are originals. Bishop is half-Lebanese, so it's tempting to see this as some kind of ""back to the roots"" affair. In the Detroit suburb where he grew up, Rick and his brother Alan were exposed to a lot of Middle Eastern music; their grandfather used to play the oud and a double-reeded flute as well as records by the likes of Fairuz and Oum Kalthoum. If you hear echoes of Morricone or surf music here, that makes sense-- pretty much any time you amplify Middle Eastern jams you realize how far that approach to sound has reached. You hear the Morricone because both Bishop and Morricone are masters at synthesizing disparate sounds from different cultures; too bad they've never gotten to collaborate. The band, consisting of guitarist Rasheed Al-Qahira, percussionist Mohammed Bandari, bassist Ahmed Sharif, and hand drummer Abdulla Basheem, is ace. It's true that a few songs could be a tad dirtier, more unhinged; undoubtedly they will in performance (at the time of this writing Bishop's on a North American tour with the group). Bishop's take on the lovely Corsican melody ""Solenzara"", for example, never leaves the earth, but it's not supposed to. That happens enough on the original ""Sidi Mansour"", anyway. Then there's the knotty yet hummable ""Barbary"", which has echoes of the Sun City Girls' Torch of the Mystics. Like that record, Freak is one of Bishop's most cohesive and accessible albums. Since it also has such an NPR-friendly backstory, expect Bishop to appear on Terry Gross soon. Which means you can also expect a record composed entirely of synth dirge nursery rhymes about circumcision next time around. That, or a Sammy Davis, Jr. tribute record. Or both!","Guitarist and Sun City Girls co-founder creates an impressive instrumental album that's instantly accessible but difficult to peg.

A Pipe Dream and a Promise,Finale,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4cbc0084474cd0c0587/1:1/w_160/ca24e49e.jpg,2009-06-19 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13186-a-pipe-dream-and-a-promise/,Interdependent Media,"Dealing with underground MCs who exhibit a crippling lack of memorable lines is easy: You shrug, pay more attention to their flow and their beats instead, and then eventually forget about them until they show up in shuffle mode and remind you that their tracks need to be deleted to make more room for Wale freestyles or whatever. But those MCs that have too many memorable lines? They're trouble. Line after line of rapid-delivery punchline rap without any breathing room, no narrative or thematic structure to keep the listener oriented, tangled metaphors that'd take some unpacking even if they weren't put together in the most syllable-juggling, internal-rhyme-friendly way-- that shit's exhausting sometimes. You can hear the skill at work, but at its most extreme it actually takes some serious concentration to parse it all. Finale has this problem-- which, when you come down to it, is a pretty fortunate problem to have. There are few better ways to get people to hit rewind than to throw as much at them as possible, and the Detroit MC's A Pipe Dream and a Promise is at least generous enough to ensure that the stuff we catch the next time around is actually worth the repeat visit. It might take more than just a second listen to acclimate yourself to his flow, especially during the album's first half, which is front-loaded with quick-cut verbal pyrotechnics and blink-and-you'll-miss-it wordplay. It acts like the lyrical equivalent of a Bourne movie action sequence: You know something kickass is happening, but it takes some adjusting of your everyday perception to lock onto it. You can thank Finale's voice for much of that: He has this half-raspy/half-hissing murmur of a voice with a sort of hiccupy percussive cadence to it, and it's so relentless in momentum that it's easy to get duped into thinking he's spitting faster than he actually is. Combine that with his tendency to keep his lyrics densely packed and throw around assonance like a pair of nunchucks, and it's a weird adventure following his lyrical train of thought (much less transcribing it). You could point at the production mix if you're frustrated, too, since his voice gets buried sometimes, and there are enough stray syllables and emphases that get lost in the snares and hi-hats to make his lyrical onslaught a bit too much of a blur. But it's not enough to detract from the pure flair for technique Finale exhibits, whether he's repping his place in the scene over some brilliantly-swiped breaks from Edgar Winter's ""Frankenstein"" on ""Arrival & Departure"", emphasizing his abilities over some warped-sounding guitar twang in ""Style"" or coolly muttering labyrinthine pop-culture-infused declarations of unstoppability over Black Milk's electronic burble for ""One Man Show"". And fortunately, even though he's got that lyrical-acrobat thing going on, he spits like that for more than just the sake of telling everyone what they can already hear in his flow. The second half of the record's where the concepts, the storytelling, and Finale's personality really start to come into play, and posit him as more than just a virtuoso rapping machine. Hearing him open up about his troubled upbringing in ""Issues"" (featuring a fantastic minimalist beat from Dimlite) or addressing his estranged, wayward sibling on ""Brother's Keeper"" keeps him grounded enough to let his style breathe and develop into something as resonant as it is flashy. ""The Senator"" has him taking ""The Wire""'s infamous Clay Davis-- ""sheeeeeiiiiiiit"" and all-- and using his political malfeasance as a springboard for calling out liars on wax. And in the album's obligatory Dilla tributes, you can tell he's busted his ass to earn the right to his beats, not just in the fact that he completely annihilates ""Heat"" (""Flood the game so heavy South Asia look like a puddle in the park/ Leave a mark like two pre-teens makin' hickeys in the dark/ Padlock your door like Joe Clark, every exit closed off"") but in the tribute he exhibits during ""Paid Homage (R.I.P. J Dilla)"". With a lush Flying Lotus remix of ""Fall in Love"" pulsing away behind him, Finale marvels over Dilla's dedication, recollects his humbled surprise that the man appreciated his work, and brings home just what he meant to the entire Detroit scene (""main Motown component, the backbone of Conant""). There are so few MCs working today who are able to carry this much of an album on their own; aside from a couple of sharp verses from Invincible on ""The Waiting Game"" and a few spoken-word interludes scattered throughout the album, Finale's voice dominates. And for all its lyrical claustrophobia, the album really falters only during those interludes, which are educational the first time around-- it's fun to hear Prince Whipper Whip talk about coming up old school at the end of ""Issues""-- but skippable each time after that. They're kind of a nuisance, mostly because you'll probably be listening to this album a lot:Â first to get the hang of Finale's slippery, torrential style, and, then, eventually, to marvel at it.","Detroit MC, armed withÂ syllable-juggling flow and memorable lines, fits alongside Black Milk and Elzhi near the top of underground hip-hop's post-Dilla world.

Foxbase Alpha / Continental,Saint Etienne,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a440b1335d7bf16988f0/1:1/w_160/15dcf982.jpg,2009-06-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13058-foxbase-alpha-continental/,Warner Bros.HeavenlyWarner Bros.Heavenly,"Like all semi-pop survivors, UK trio Saint Etienne have settled into a warm familiarity. A deep catalog-- one that shows more refinement than reinvention over the past 10 years-- means the band's stuck with its cult. But that's actually got to be a pretty comforting idea in 2009, as any overworked young buzz band approaching onstage breakdown before album two can tell you. Still: What about when Saint Etienne was new, maybe even a potential commercial prospect? Listen to this new reissue of the band's debut album, 1991's Foxbase Alpha and you'll hear that, then as now, Saint Etienne made lovely, accessible music. But Foxbase is also far closer to capital-P pop than the band's recent refined blend of exuberance and melancholy.Â So why didn't I hear Saint Etienne songs like Foxbase's ""Nothing Can Stop Us"" and ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart""-- both Billboard #1s on the dance charts-- burbling from communal boomboxes in eighth grade? One theory for why Saint Et stiffed in the States is also a big part of the band's draw to many fans: The potentially limiting pleasures of Anglophilia. So yes, Foxbase is littered with odd, musty little samples from odd, musty Olde England, and beats from the highly polished dancefloors of contemporary London. In fact, Pitchfork contributor Tom Ewing once wrote a wonderful essay that suggested Foxbase was best understood as a musical embodiment of the whole vibe of late 20th-century UK living, including, but not limited to, the mix of chic, glossy multi-cultural collisions and grubby, hospitably lived-in neighborhoods that made up London itself.Â (A brief break to get some conflict of interest stuff out of the way: A) The aforementioned Mr. Ewing contributes an essay to the liner notes of the Foxbase reissue, and B) Saint Etienne member Bob Stanley has contributed to Pitchfork. If either of those things stick in your craw while reading the more-or-less gush that follows, well, sorry.) Another reason Saint Etienne never hit with a U.S. mass audience? While the likes of Snap! and Crystal Waters made big-budget dance records with an urbane sheen, records that would work in any capital city club around the world, Foxbase Alpha's sonics had a DIY edge, an underground-gone-mainstream bulletin from a very specific milieu. Albeit one that can still be enjoyed by anyone not predisposed to hate the soft, the sunny, the lilting, the laid-back, and the mildly twee. Foxbase is on one level a UK indie pop record with a particularly unique sound and vision-- the joys and pangs of cusp-of-adulthood love and loss, delivered with a clued-in-ingenue mix of wide-eyed enthusiasm and knowing languor by Sarah Cracknell, set to a backing stitched from the gentler side of pop history by studio whizzes Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs. It's just a unique indie pop record that happened to bump to a bright pop pulse. What's funny about bringing up the always divisive p-word is that I remember some big-name 90s dance producers actually dissing Saint Etienne by calling the band ""bubblegum.""Â We can assume those producers meant Saint Etienne erred too much on the indie side, sacrificing dancefloor kick. But much like the Anglophilic fantasy world the band conjures, that split allegiance is another part of Saint Etienne's specific appeal. Foxbase tracks like ""Spring"" and the cover of Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" do indeed sound like heart-on-sleeve pop kids (in the C86 sense) trying their quite adroit hands at lounge-y hip-house and piano-driven disco. But several of Foxbase's best tunes move past adding idiosyncratic touches to off-the-rack uptempo 4/4 rhythms, and into something more unique and beguiling. The drowsy, heartsick ballad ""Carnt Sleep"" sounds like a humid summer spent spinning Sarah Records 7""s back to back with Sade, slick soul secretly slid into an indie-friendly sleeve. Or there's the Cocteau Twins-ian shivers of ""London Belongs to Me"", with its smitten, multi-tracked Cracknell crooning to herself across a diamond sea of piano chords. Assured but approachable, these club-informed but not quite club-ready songs offered a wholly other kind of ""indie dance"" from the previous punk-funk generation or the cheap-and-easy preset-punching remixes of the blog-house era, something like careful cursive on pastel paper compared to blurry cut-and-paste photocopies or generic computer typeface."" Foxbase squeezes so many ""lighter side of"" sounds-- be they from the worlds of rock, dance, soul, whatever-- into one LP that it's a marvel it sounds so unified, mostly owing to Wiggs and Stanley fixing on the platonic house rhythm as the glue to hold their disparate passions together. But the second disc of bonus tracks often feels like two producers still figuring out how to make the raw materials of post-acid house their own. A grab-bag of late 80s/early 90s rave sonics-- only sometimes processed through what we know as the Saint Etienne idiom-- dates much of the material. ""Chase HQ"" and ""Speedwell"" are competent but sketchy early UK house singles, full of jittery samples and keyboard stabs. Fun, but ultimately too generic without Cracknell's voice or the sample-choice oddness and studio chops Wiggs and Stanley would bring to the band's later music. Better is the dub playground chant of ""Sally Space"", Cracknell humming ""Iko Iko"" through a quiet storm front of classic ambient house textures, the Orb with a dose of girl-pop glee. Speaking of the p-word (again): Continental, a previously Japan-only odds-and-ends collection reissued in the same batch of Saint Et records as this new Foxbase, works as a sort of mirror image of Too Young to Die, the band's almost absurdly listenable 1995 singles compilation. If the all-hits uniformity of TYTD represents Saint Etienne's final, most obvious stab at Now That's What I Call Pop immortality, then Continental is the beginning of the more wide-ranging (and hit-or-miss) restlessness that's characterized the band's records from 1998's Good Humor onward. Each track is recognizably Saint Etienne-- Cracknell's inimitable winsome-but-grown-and-sexy coo announces that, if nothing else-- but the tracks (frequently darker, often instrumental) go very different places than the uniform, bubbly house-lite of Foxbase's uptempo moments. So much so that when legit UK hit ""He's on the Phone""-- not coincidentally the only track Continental shares with Too Young to Die-- shimmers into earshot, it's such a glittering throwback to the old Saint Etienne that it nearly skews the vibe of the whole collection. ""He's on the Phone"" is Saint Et's most deliriously normal single, a go-for-broke attempt at the kind of high-test mainstream house that still appears on comps with ""Ibiza"" unironically in their titles.Â The rest of Continental offers another of Saint Etienne's seemingly paradoxical combos. It's far more subdued, even reflective, than Foxbase's unashamedly hooks-first buoyancy. But it's also sonically ""big"" in a way that makes it seem like a commentary on the mid-90s moment when even chill-out-centric electronic music went stadium-sized. ""Burnt Out Car"" and ""Stormtrooper in Drag"" have, respectively, the kind of thick and fluffy prog-house keyboards and crashing drums you could imagine Underworld or Orbital using to whip a festival audience into a frenzy, a far cry from the ""made in your friend's flat"" scale of Foxbase. The effect of this surface-level bigness in Saint Et's hands is decidedly different, though, than in those their Glastonbury-headling contemporaries. It's the sound of the band's blithe young lovers suddenly forced to grow up as money and traditional notions of glamor infiltrate their imagined world. Even as they age, though,Â and club-life-as-permanent-playground gives way to club-life-as-vector-for-adult-pain, Saint Etienne's cast of characters retain an unrepentant sentimental streak, one not so much obliterated by experience as deepened by it. ""Groveley Road"" and ""Suburban Autumn Lieutenant"" exude a vibe of poignant longing that's hammy as hell-- it takes guts to include an image as blatant as ""the season has changed"" in a song about the dissipation of love-- but also wholly convincing if you go with it. While listening to these reissues during an oppressively gloomy, rain-sodden East Coast springtime, I also re-read Martin Amis' London Fields, a vision of the city as the second millennium drew to a close that's almost Foxbase's inverse: A world of venal yuppies, reprehensible con-men, and lost souls who've long since given up on love. Saint Etienne's heart-on-sleeve protagonists (and audience) were too earnest to conceivably survive a day in such an overwhelmingly beaten-down environment. The sort of ""decaying violent reality of the harsh urban etcetera"" that Mr. Ewing's essay suggests Saint Et caught shit for ""ignoring."" Equally fantastical, Amis' all-ugly-all-the-time London is also Anglophilic catnip, just the kind that tends to impress the sort of American who prefers sardonic ""we're all fucked"" loathing to idealism or nostalgia. Grossly sentimental as it may sound, though, at the moment I'll take Foxbase's imaginary year-round summer, where it's ""too warm to even hold hands"" but the rush and flush of first-love makes it too tempting to resist. There's enough doom-mongering waiting for me when I open the BBC News website every morning to not enjoy a little escapism.","The debut album and a rare odds-and-ends collection from the venerable UK group are reissued, providing further evidence of their versatile pop genius.

Passage,Pocahaunted,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4dfea9e61561daa4ff2/1:1/w_160/194db875.jpg,2009-06-18 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13191-passage/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Pocahaunted churn out psychedelic ambient jams aligned with freak folk as much as the crude Native American-isms their name suggests. The beaded intersection wherein the former began cannibalizing the latter has always been particularly fertile for outsider art: peyote trips, sweat lodge bliss-outs, pastoral time travel, spirit animal petting zoos, and oh yeah, seeking out reservations both psychic and very real. So while copping so much more in pursuit of an aesthetic makes great ammo for eye-rolls, it doesn't take away from the fact that Pocahaunted have synthesized something here every bit as affected as it is affecting. Four tracks and just short of 40 minutes, Passage is passive listening defined. Hooks don't exist and melodic texture appears only if you're willing to wait on it. If that sounds like some fifth dimension, Magic Eye-type shit, it's because it is. Previous cassettes and vinyl releases contained detours through dub waters, but this, the Eagle Rock ""sisterhood""'s latest, feels like the most focused expression of the clouded atmospherics they've been attempting to live in on tape. Drippy guitars lope, drone, and dance around Amanda Brown and Bethany Cosentino's creepy kiva moans, the mallet-on-drums percussion loose and insistent enough to strongly reinforce the ceremonial/ritual vibes this music lives and dies by. The oddly circular relationship between guitar and vocals here is actually a potential dealbreaker. Passage's first half in particular catches the tail it chases, the twin crescendos of ""Palm"" and ""Salt"" locked-in and momentous enough to make it through the blankets of smoke and murk in which they germinate. Not the case with Act II. ""Dusk"" sits inert, neither the organ nor intermittent bursts of cymbal and dank guitar connect with Brown and Cosentino's vocal droning. The result, just as it is in the I-swear-I-just-saw-my-future-and-it-was-too-gnarly stoner vortex of ""Veil"", is claustrophobic to an upsetting degree, leaving the listener feeling more trapped than lost within its sound.","Previous cassette and vinyl releases contained detours through dub waters, but here Pocahaunted offer aÂ more focused expression of their clouded atmospherics.

Adaptations #1 Mixtape,Ada,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a7ea9e61561daa4f60/1:1/w_160/9619af41.jpg,2009-06-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13143-adaptations-1-mixtape/,Kompakt,"The dance-album-as-single-artist-mix is such a good idea, addressing so many of the attention-straining problems that plague dance music full-lengths, that you have to wonder why more producers don't make use of it. Several of the best dance music ""albums"" of the past few years-- like the Ricardo Villalobos and Omar S Fabric mixes, to name just two-- have managed to offer an hour-plus of (more-or-less) new music while also offering motion, an emotional/musical arc that justifies their running time. Especially with your more (there's no other word, sorry) minimal dance acts, the single-artist mix ideally prevents you from ever thinking, ""Have I just been listening to someone fiddle with their trackpad for the past five minutes?"" Or, ""Does this make me happy, or would I maybe be better off playing a Loverboy song?"" Ada's Adaptations collects 12 of the German producer's original tracks and remixes by and for other artists, strung into a mix that's neither as virtuosically deranged as Villalobos' or as functionally banging as Omar S'. Instead, it's one of the most inviting techno mixes/albums you'll hear this year, damn near cuddly. Don't mistake it for a pop record, though, or any sort of crossover stab, despite the preponderance of vocals and two indie-friendly covers. (Well, her remix of Brant's ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" comes off more of a titular nod in the direction of certain Mancunians, its melody drooping electro melancholia, rather than the sprightly Johnny Marr version of same.) But a mix/album that opens with the warm-blanket-on-a-cold-day purr of Everything But the Girl's Tracey Thorn, and includes a twinkly Michael Mayer/Tobias Thomas take on the looped longing Ada sieved from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps""? That's pretty far from the forbidding clichÃ© of the all-beats-and-nothing-but techno mix. And when she goes purely (or almost) instrumental, Ada's taste still veers towards the laconic, blissful, and immediately appealing. The DJ Koze remix of ""Eve"", perhaps the one true 21st-century classic on the mix, may open with a scratched-in flurry of hip-hop and feature a repeating vocal sample that's a chipmunk-squeaky nod to old-school rave. But its twanging bassline and Jonzun Crew synth-chirrups are buffeted by billowing keyboards you'd mistake for shoegaze glaze if they were played by guitars in a more rock-centric context. Robin Guthrie would nod with grandfatherly approval at the fluffy, reverb-drenched sound of much of Adaptations, its pleasantly floaty and frou-frou vibe. Even Ada's nods to trad dance sounds, like the quasi-Spanish ""guitar"" that lazily twangs through her remix of Andi Teichmann's ""Tape"", are hazy in a manner more transmission-from-space than crisp, neo-Balearic banger. It's maybe just a tad funny that, as a mix, Adaptations is just okay. On the evidence, Ada belongs to the long-slow-fade school of transitions, which suits her fuzzy sonics well enough. It just doesn't provide many jolts or surprises, easing you from track to track with a chain of bleeps or two overlapping melody lines. (On the other hand, turntablist trickery would just sound awkward applied to tracks that unfurl rather than bend or twist.) Still, though the oomph gently leaks out over the final quarter, there's enough bounce in her beats and b-lines to keep the record from evaporating into indistinct ambiance. Adaptations glides quite gracefully between floor-filler and recliner-friendly.","Collecting original tracks along with remixes by and for the German producer, this is one of the most inviting techno albums you'll hear this year.

Black Meteoric Star,Black Meteoric Star,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50eea9e61561daa5047/1:1/w_160/1d91cc6b.jpg,2009-06-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13231-black-meteoric-star/,DFA,"All but the brashest dance music carries at least a whiff of cosmic consciousness, a belief that the right combination of repetitive beats and unknown variables can plot a course to crack the stratosphere. But that transcendental urge is rarely so explicitly articulated as on Gavin Russom's self-titled album as Black Meteoric Star.Â The album is, in many ways, a direct extension of the smoldering freakouts of Days of Mars, a 2005 album Russom recorded with Delia Gonzalez. There, they harnessed a battery of vintage and home-built synthesizers to create their own version of classic ambient music-- liquid, evolving, nominally ""beatless,"" but imbued with unmistakable pulses cycling at different speeds. You could trace its sounds and ideas to electronic and compositional pioneers such as Brian Eno, Klaus Schulze, Steve Reich, Pete Namlook, and Carl Craig, but the obviousness of the lineage never stood in the way of the music's immediate, visceral qualities. On Black Meteoric Star, Russom takes the duo's obsessive pursuits and applies them to the well-worn conventions of classic house and techno. Marked by simple, contrapuntal synthesizer arpeggios and jittery drum machine patterns, the music at first recalls the humid, shorted-wire minimalism of pioneering house and acid; it's not surprising to hear Russom namecheck Chicago's TRAX label and some of its artists in an interview with London's FACT magazine. Sounds evocative of classic machines like the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and TR-707 Rhythm Composer contribute to the vintage feel. Hallmarks of original house productions-- woodblocks, tambourines, hi-hats-- are now deeply rooted tropes, but Russom doesn't get tangled up in his piety. (The current vogue for intoning phrases like ""house music"" or ""Detroit"" over generically shoomping chords and congas is blissfully absent here.) He flirts with funk, but Black Meteoric Star isn't much interested in the humor or sensuality that animated Chicago's mid-80s house musicians. Instead of Robert Armani or Phuture's needling minimalism, he tends to a maximalist, sprawling psychedelia. Ultimately, what Russom draws from his analog dance-music forebears has more to do with process than sound. Early house music derived much of its curious charge from the constraints its producers faced. Mothered by necessity, they made do with obsolete, bargain-basement instruments, often turning them on their ear and perverting their intended uses; they arranged in step time and recorded live, with none of the cut-and-paste convenience available in contemporary audio software. Russom likewise sticks to an all-analog setup combining vintage synthesizers and drum machines with more obscure boxes of his own invention; he records live in single takes. This necessitates a strict economy of means: the music is stripped down to only as many elements as can be reasonably manipulated in real time. His tracks batter a handful of ideas over and over again, with most of the variation a result of twisting filters and tweaking envelopes. But where TRAX emphasized the negative space that yawned in between the notes, Russom uses distortion and delay to smear his sounds into something corroded and verging on the limits of control. On ""World Eater"", there's at least one point where the beat audibly slips, most likely the result of his machines' wonky, loose-leashed timekeeping. (Synchronizing jerry-rigged circuitry like this, without the controlling hand of MIDI pushing things forward, is a notoriously dodgy affair.) It's not as jarring as you'd think-- only a DJ in mid-mix would likely notice the slippage. But it's a reminder that Black Meteoric Star comes at ""dance music"" with an outsider's perspective. This stuff is worlds away from contemporary house and techno's relentless professionalism, perfect timekeeping, and pristine compression. The tracks are abuzz with line noise; the first four tracks bleed warm, tubelike distortion, while the final two sound like they were recorded live to a room mic, one possibly draped in milk-soaked cloth. That's part of the music's appeal, and also one of its ironies: At a time when the ""democratizing"" effect of music software has led to a glut of functional, professionally competent but imaginatively bankrupt music, the insistence upon a lo-fi aesthetic-- or better, ethic-- becomes something like a badge of honor, an auteur's protest. Doth Russom protest too much? Maybe. The music doesn't always measure up to its conceptual ambitions. ""Death Tunnel"", one of the album's shortest tracks, barely merits its 378 seconds, and makes a self-defeating opener for the album. The rhythm plods, its eighth-note hi-hats cutting awkwardly into mushy arpeggios. And as intriguing as the basement-inventor backstory is, all that hand soldering sometimes makes you wish for more. In an interview with TheFader.com, Russom explains that he built his own machines because they allow him to do things that aren't possible with commercially available gear, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from the music itself. The drum patches are familiar from a thousand recordings; far more radical sounds have been conjured by synthesists with modular systems or even over-the-counter analog gear. And I'll admit to a slight resentment of the fact that the DFA imprimatur assures Russom the kind of press that any number of artists who have long worked in a similar idiom (Mark Verbos, Ra-X, Legowelt, Unit Moebius, Giorgio Gigli, Donato Dozzy, even Omar S, and many of them more skilled and engrossing than BMS) will never enjoy. But in Russom's defense, he's not trying to re-invent the wheel, just forge his own from the materials. Something about Black Meteoric Star sucks you in, undeniably. A year ago, I was skeptical about the first four tracks I heard, longer versions of four included here; my doubts didn't abate when hearing the finished album. But after an initial near-dismissal, I found myself coming back to the record again and again, then searching for interviews with the artist to find out exactly what motivated these strange analog hailstorms, which worry away at their material with obsessive determination. All six tracks are suffused with high drama; there's something almost tectonic about them, the way rocky patterns are shoved aside by colliding plates of sound, overtones flying off like sparks in hot ash. It's clenched, anxious music, but there's something profoundly relaxing about it. Depending upon your state of mind, it hunches in the background like a cushion of white noise, or, turned up loud, heaves the horizontal axis on high-- a vision of the dance floor as space elevator. It's no coincidence that the strongest tracks here are the longest ones (though the six-minute barrage of ""Dominatron"" is as forcefully evil as its title would suggest). The slack, toe-scuffingly funky ""World Eater"" and the grinding ""Anthem"" are both 10-minute samples of infinity. At 14 minutes long, ""Dreamcatcher"" dares to attempt more ambitious structures, juggling drum tracks and piling up counterpoints into a honeyed churn. And the andante ""Dawn"", sounding like the soundtrack for underwater breakdancing, turns 18 and a half minutes into a spaced-out blink of an eye. That kind of expansive vision is nothing new in dance music, of course; if anything, it's becoming routine, in the wake of quarter-hour anthems from the likes of Ricardo Villalobos and LindstrÃ¸m. But I get the sense that Russom's neverending sequences come from listening to the world around him: specifically, the days-long club culture of Berlin, where he lives now. These intense, sustained workouts are as spiritually inclined as the most gospel-infused ""spiritual house,"" just in different ways; they're reaching for the void that turns the dance floor inside out. (The irony is that you'd be hard-pressed to hear any of these tracks served up on Berlin's minimal smorgasbord, which recycles house music's watered-down tropes like a sushi restaurant serves up limp tuna on its endless conveyor belt.) It's true that there's something a little bit precious about it all-- for instance, the fact that Russom once performed the project as part of a collaboration with the multi-media artists Assume Vivid Astro Focus that featured costumes, balloons, laser, and video projections. (In video clips of the performance, the balloons are a reminder of David Mancuso's Loft, while the projections and dancers more mundanely recall, well, just about any mainstream club from the Meatpacking District to Mitte.) But why shouldn't Russom at least try to do something special with his presentation-- especially when coming from the spectacle-shy world of indie rock? ""Projecting a 'fantasy environment' is important to me when I make dance music,"" Russom told FACT. ""It's something I do half-consciously, imagining the place where the music would fit ideally or what people would be wearing, etc. Like, 'What is the world that this belongs in?' It's quite sad that the dance floor is disappearing from the cultural landscape. It's a very important place."" Russom may come from a house outsider's background, but just like he and Gonzalez got ambient, I think he gets dance culture. Black Meteoric Star is a spiritual thing, a body thing; a cheeky thief and a generous giver. It's a long night out and a longer walk home, mind abuzz, ears ringing.","Gavin Russom, once teamed with Delia Gonzalez, goes his own way on his heavily nostalgic debut DFA album as Black Meteoric Star.

BlaQKout,DJ QuikKurupt,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f35e6ef959693209b3/1:1/w_160/f6c3d45f.jpg,2009-06-18 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13211-blaqkout/,Mad Science,"Rap history is biased towards royalty, whether you're the king of your block or the King of the South. DJ Quik's two-decade career has established him as one of the genre's great recording artists, but his maturation from teenage Compton DJ to a complex embodiment of California post-gangster party rap doesn't have much cachet in a hip-hop history that celebrates only winners. Quik's music feels increasingly undervalued; being known as the ultimate ""underrated"" West Coast rapper-producer has become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. His latest record, a joint effort with Dogg Pound rapper Kurupt entitled BlaQKout, finds the producer at his most creatively restless, forgoing the comfortable up-tempo dance beats of his late-90s peak for a style much more difficult to pin down. Each track feels unique; the producer sounds eager to push his own internal boundaries and subvert his stylistic quirks. But what makes this riskier record successful is also what makes it cohesive: it is a very fun album. Kurupt's career is similarly undervalued, albeit on a smaller scale; a rapper raised in Philly and famous in L.A., he bridged the cerebral, technical detachment of the East Coast with the West's gangster swagger and confrontational demeanor, before blasting off in more avant directions for his 2001 record, Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey. Although he continues to bring both styles to the table,Â BlaQKout finds the Dogg Pound member embracing his rap-for-rap's-sake lyrical experimentalism wholeheartedly. Kurupt seems so committed to the idea of saying not that much in a very complicated way that it's utterly compelling. Quik, on the other hand, is consistently literal, dealing in the concrete with memorable, loosely connected run-on raps. He's also a schizophrenic lyricist, unafraid of imagery that seems out of place or contradictory to the overall mood, his charismatic charm rescuing verses that should undermine him conceptually. His confessional, endearing lyrics are like bar conversations with strangers where, after a few drinks, you start offhandedly spilling personal anecdotes to each other like old friends. At some basic level, Quik bonds easily with his audience, letting his guard down, expressing himself with uninhibited honesty. As a producer, Quik understands that making quality rap music isn't about banging out minor variations of a signature style. BlaQKout's narrative is one of surprise and variation, of creating one set of expectations, then pulling the rug out from underneath the audience one track later. One moment he's dropping confrontational funk banger ""Fuck Y'all"", stable hip-hop head comfort food. By the next track, he's sampling Moroccan music from an episode of the Travel Channel's ""Bizarre Foods With Andrew Zimmern"", melding it to cavernous drums and a summerjam-worthy chorus, all while rapping about trapping you in your nightmares and how your poison is his liquor. It is as if, after each song, Quik stepped back and entirely reconsidered the whole project, upsetting any predictable motion or boring moments by drawing from a bottomless bag of tricks. As the record progresses, however, there's more bravado to Quik's experimentalism. The closer he comes to untethered adventurousness, the easier it is to develop a nagging feeling that certain tracks are more interesting to talk about than they are to actually listen to. Consider ""Exodus"", a dubbed-out pseudo-Jamaican interlude/instrumental chant with no rapping, or ""Jupiter's Critic & the Mind of Mars"", an abrasive, bizarre track with grinding, distorted electro-bass. Both tracks are ridiculous and self-indulgent, but creative and fun at the same time. Quik's focus on amusingly upsetting the status quo is so well-considered, his spirit so fully committed to the idea of making this work, that heÂ pulls this shit off. So what about Quik's worldview givesÂ BlaQKout such cohesion, unites vibes as disparate as ""Do You Know""'s shimmering gauziness and ""9x's Outta Ten""'s thunderous, jagged exotica? After all these years, he's remained a great DJ. The conceptual approach to this record, its sequencing and contrasts, suggests he not only values the music on a song-for-song basis, but is aware the meta-narrative itself is significant. He knows the context of our reception affects our appreciation, and our willingness to let him push the envelope requires that we trust him not to leave us stranded. Imagine how different the record would have been if ""Jupiter's Critic"" was the lead single; ballsy, yes, but also presumptuous. Instead, we're eased into Quik's exhilarating world gradually. He earns our trust in order to take us wherever he wants to go, finally resolving with the satisfying consonance of ""The Appeal"". But it's also about his eagerness to entertain, to take risks in order to do something truly different. BlaQKout doesn't come from boring rapper royalty. It's by a DJ, a modern court jester, his ideas shifting with raucous unpredictably, a performer who doesn't just make music, but shapes the way we hear it.","Underrated hip-hop vets combine to make a surprising, disparate, and frequently brilliant record.

Hands,Little Boots,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f05e6ef959693209ae/1:1/w_160/b2741dcc.jpg,2009-06-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13209-hands/,Atlantic679,"""Pop"" is easy to write and even easier to say, but it's not so easy to pull off successfully. Victoria ""Little Boots"" Hesketh has been outspoken in embracing the term. ""A pop song is just this three-and-a-half-minute nugget, but it can be so powerful,"" the synth-toting songstress from Blackpool, England, told Carson Daly the night of her first L.A. show. ""My problem with a lot of mainstream pop artists-- I love the songs, and I think they're great songs a lot of the time, but they don't have enough character for me."" A musician since childhood, Hesketh once got rejected in the opening rounds of the UK's ""Pop Idol"". She went on to play in a jazz trio, a big band, and, by 2005, a punk-charged synth group called Dead Disco. That's around when L.A. session mainstay Greg Kurstin (one half of jazzy electropop duo the Bird and the Bee; previously of 1990s one-hit wonders Geggy Tah) started prodding Hesketh to focus on writing pop songs. From there, it's almost too good to be true: One minute she's covering Human League on YouTube in her pajamas, the next she's partying with Kanye West and Brandon Flowers. If you're a former ""TRL"" host, that's a refreshing do-it-yourself tale. If you're a more skeptical sort, you check the price tag of the Japanese electronic instrument she has helped publicize, and you wonder. Little Boots' debut album, then, is a mainstream pop effort with an indie-friendly narrative. It's a savvy approach, effectively bridging the gap between poptimism and alt snobbery. One three-and-a-half-minute nugget comes after another, with the directness of Madonna and the fashion sense, too: There's blog-house distortion, Italo-disco sweep, and the dayglo tranceyness of recent electronic-based pop-rap hits. The hooks, however, tend to be more Hard Candy than The Immaculate Collection. I really like one song, and I think they're decent enough songs a lot of the time, but all too often Hands is as lacking in character as the music Hesketh criticizes. Hands' most distinguishing characteristic is an unusual level of meta-pop self-awareness. Kind of clever the first time: ""Stuck on Repeat"", produced by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard and co-written with Goddard and Kurstin, still throbs like a Kylie Minogue crush. But then there's latest single ""New in Town"", a glammy going-out song that also doubles as an artist introduction-- she wants to take us out tonight, and she wants to make us feel all right, but staying in sounds good, too. On ""Remedy"", producer/co-writer RedOne (Akon, Lady Gaga) lends generic club-rap swagger but can't convince that this ""music is the cure""; bittersweet soft-rocker ""Tune Into My Heart"", co-written with accomplished Belgian producer/songwriter Pascal Gabriel (New Order's ""Regret"", Dido), asks what's the frequency and never quite finds its signal. Even the songs that aren't commenting on themselves lyrically sound like they're commenting on themselves musically. Despite radio-ready production and commercial hooks that tell us we're hearing pop, it can take some hours of intense listening before most of these tunes ever stick in the head, and there's little to no emotional investment. ""Symmetry"" has the Human League's Phil Oakey, and ""Mathematics"" has a metaphor inspired by Sylvia Plath's ""Love Is a Parallax"", but their by-the-numbers synth-pop is more science than art. ""I'm like a moth into the flame,"" Hesketh coos on ""Hearts Collide"", a sultry Minogue-vogue spacewalk. We all have someone we like with trite lyrics or an average voice, but what makes the best pop songs successful is that they have some quality uniquely their own, and that's mostly absent here. Paradoxically, Hands works best as pop when Hesketh taps indie-famous collaborators. The second-best song is also the second single, ""Meddle"", where the production and songwriting team from ""Stuck on Repeat"" turn toward rock's angst and propulsion. Simian Mobile Disco's Jas Shaw lends his skills to a pair of solid if lyrically dismal tracks: the spacious ""Click"" (""I thought you were a condition/ That no one else could treat"") and the pattering ""Ghosts"", which has a deftly pirouetting melody that helps make it one of the only songs here that doesn't sound like Hesketh is trying to be someone else, someone more mundane. A few years ago, I wrote a column suggesting that the ideal pop star of today is someone like Robyn: polished chart-pop sound, still writes her own songs. Then along came Lily Allen. Now even in country, a genre not traditionally given to valuing singer/songwriters, you find people praising Taylor Swift because she writes her own songs and records for an ""indie"" label. So Little Boots, with her unabashed love of pop and her honest-to-goodness instrumental ability-- check the piano-driven hidden track-- has the right package for the current moment, and if Lady Gaga and La Roux can click with the public, maybe she will, too. Then again, calling yourself pop isn't guaranteed to bring you popularity. Songs don't get stuck on repeat unless people can't get them out of their heads.","UK It Girl teams with members of Hot Chip, Simian Mobile Disco, and the Bird and the Bee on her much-anticipated debut.

Skeletons,Tiny Masters of Today,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46e9d034d5c69bf307d/1:1/w_160/d12b8d1a.jpg,2009-06-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13096-skeletons/,Mute,"It is easy to overrate music made by kids. First and foremost: the ""they are pretty good for their age!"" factor, which can override critical faculties and make us forgive the sort of artistic decisions we'd normally find boring or annoying in the work of adults. If the young musicians are clearly influenced by things we deem cool, there is a high risk of approving their work simply for affirming our tastes. Most obviously, no one wants to be the creep who begrudges the youthful enthusiasm of people who are clearly having a good time doing cool stuff at a very early age. Nevertheless, if we're being very honest, the music made by children and young teenagers is almost always awful, and the Tiny Masters of Today, despite being signed to an EMI label, are not an exception to the rule. The Tiny Masters are Ada (13) and Ivan (15), siblings from Brooklyn who have been writing and performing together since their early tweens. They are always joined by an older musician on drums-- in the old days, it was Russell Simins from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, but on Skeletons, they are joined by Jackson Pollis, an 18-year-old who is also a member of model Agyness Deyn's band. The fact that these kids apparently require a chaperon is somewhat troubling, but it's probably for the best, as the percussion on the record is solid enough to prop up their understandably limited musical skills. That said, the level of musicianship on the record is adequate, and at least on the same level as countless mediocre punk and indie bands. That's the root of the problem with the Tiny Masters of Today, though. They are impressive only in comparison to a) other kids their age who have not somehow been encouraged to become a full-time touring band by hipster stage parents, and b) their least-inspired adult contemporaries. At their best, the Tiny Masters provide self-conscious kiddy variations on vaguely arty strains of punk and alt-rock, but there is very little practical use for this music besides causing adults to go, ""awww, cute!"" The lyrics are predictably banal and laughable, the vocals are uniformly flat and insecure. The melodies are not bad, but they are simplistic and mostly have the irritating cadences of playground chants and jingles. (Truly, much of the album sounds like a series of homemade Mountain Dew ads.) Though they are kids being kids, there is something very off-putting about how much the Tiny Masters buy into established notions of what punky music made by young teens ought to be like. Many of us were at our most emotional and melodramatic at 13 and 15, but Ivan and Ada seem intent on projecting an image of good-natured brattiness that comes across as false and hollowly nostalgic as a ""Dennis the Menace"" comic strip. There is an alarming lack of imagination in evidence on Skeletons, and virtually nothing in the way of strong emotion. Every song is charmlessly cutesy, and the most passionate moment on the record comes when Ada slams her square peers on ""Abercrombie Zombie"". This work may be ""pretty good for their age,"" but that's about it. It does not matter how old the authors may be-- this is very shallow, unengaging music, and it is hard to imagine anyone truly caring about any of these songs.","Hipster stage parents begat teen indie band with predictable results.

I Was a King,I Was A King,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50c5e6ef959693209ed/1:1/w_160/d76f15b6.jpg,2009-06-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13229-i-was-a-king/,Control Group,"Not to get all protectionist here, but it seems pointless to import so many 1960s-mining indie rock outfits to America when we've got plenty of perfectly good 60s-mining acts right here at home. Yet Norway's I Was a King offer a welcome twist on the same ol'. Sure, all the usual signifiers are swimming through the group's self-titled second album, as well as elements borrowed from pioneering 60s synthesists Big Star or the Raspberries (the group covers a song from 60s survivor Larry Norman, too).Â But I Was a King also go well beyond that span, right up through the 1990s heyday of shoegaze and its own sideways 60s synthesists, from Teenage Fanclub to My Bloody Valentine. Imagine Matthew Sweet's ""Girlfriend"", only with Kevin Shields and J Mascis subbed in for Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd, and you get an idea of I Was a King's cumulative, generation-spanning appeal, at least theoretically. But as good as that may read, the sounds here are mostly enlisted in service of largely predictable and not quite fully formed power-pop. It doesn't help that Frode StrÃ¸mstad isn't much of a singer, but in his defense, his thin vocals are secondary to the craft. To that end StrÃ¸mstad's roped in some impressive ringers: Sufjan Stevens, Serena Maneesh's Emil Nikolaisen, Danielson's Daniel Smith, the Ladybug Transistor's Gary Olson, all of whom produce or play throughout the disc. Just what they all contribute, specifically, isn't revealed by the sleeve notes, nor is their influence readily apparent (barring Nikolaisen's love of fuzz). But neither does StrÃ¸mstad sound like some puppet, instead confidently directing songs such as ""Breathe"" and ""Step Aside"" through their fleeting but hooky paths. The record's relative facelessness is lifted, however, when StrÃ¸mstad knocks out one of the album's handful of highlights. Piano-padding aside, ""It's All You"" is melancholy power-pop at its finest, matched by the mellow Dino Jr. roar of ""Not Like This"" and ""Weighing Anchor"". Best of all is ""Norman Bleik"" (as if all the subtle Teenage Fanclub nods weren't obvious enough) the perfect balance of jangle and fuzz that handily wraps up all the group's strong points into one tidy package. Curiously, all these songs come at the tail end of the album, and, coincidentally or not, most hone closer to the three-minute mark or beyond, too, an arguable sign that StrÃ¸mstad knew a good thing when he wrote it and fleshed it out. Conversely, these peaks lessen the impact of the rest of the disc, revealing the flaws of even long-tested rock formulas. Hooks are one thing, but songs are another, and the former can only rarely carry the latter. I Was a King aren't quite at that point, but the band's definitely worth watching.","Norwegian power-pop band mines 1960s guitar pop, as well as the bands who have since done the same-- Big Star, Teenage Fanclub.

Over Air,Gregor Samsa,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c113d1975652138da4/1:1/w_160/113b5fbd.jpg,2009-06-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13166-over-air/,Kora,"Music is a wave. Radio is a wave. Radio playing music is a wave carrying another wave to your receiver. You have to love physics for exposing us to things like this that we can't see. Knowing what a sound wave and a radio wave are makes it all the more amazing how significant the emotional effects of properly organized sound waves can be. Light waves are completely different, but they combine quite nicely with sound waves at a live show to give a band an idea of how its audience is responding and an audience something to respond to. So the radio session is a bit of an oddity among live recordings, because it almost always removes light from the equation-- there's an audience out there, but how big is it? Who is in it? What are they thinking? Because of this, bands are essentially free to indulge themselves, which is one of the reasons radio sessions have proven such a great source of bootlegs over the years (good sound quality is another). On Over Air, Gregor Samsa have saved bootleggers the trouble by presenting a studio performance for Dutch radio station VPRO. The band's hushed, glacial sound is the kind of thing that works best when all else is quiet, so this is probably the most sensible way for them to get a live record out there. There's precious little to hold onto in this music-- Champ Bennett's slow-moving songs coalesce from the most minimal of elements, like water droplets forming from mist on a windshield. It certainly offers little of the existential terror implied by their Kafka-referencing name. Even after listening to this album 13 times, I can hardly remember any of it-- and I knew most of these songs beforehand!-- but I don't think that's really the point anyway. This is music of the moment, meant for you to live inside of while it's there and evaporate. Little bits like the ""seems the devil's got a grip on me"" chorus from ""Jeroen Van Aken"" offer melody to hook you a bit, but even that is delivered in such a quiet, retiring way by the shy boy-girl harmonies of Champ and Nikki Bennett (who used to be Nikki King) that it's as if they're afraid to impose the song on you. It is exceedingly pretty though, as is pretty much the entire disc. The keyboard washes, sprinkling of piano, smeared clarinet and violin, and guitars that don't sound like guitars all add up to a very pleasant listening experience. The one moment of truly momentous drama comes on ""Young And Old"", originally from their 55:12 album, when the track explodes for a few moments into a fountain of overdriven guitar. Most of the other songs are drawn from 2008's Rest LP, including ""Abutting, Dismantling"", with its shifting texture and gradual build to a steady, pounding mid-section. There are a few non-VPRO tracks as well: an alternate mix of ""Du Meine Leise"" and a couple of very sleepy ambient instrumentals that don't diminish from the package but also add little. If you'd like to see the band doing its thing, the disc also includes a generous 30-minute video of them performing in Paris that actually finds them a bit more lively than the VPRO performance-- ""Rock Song"" is particularly inspired. Maybe there's something to those light waves after all. This bit of added value makes this a very worthy addition to a Gregor Samsa fan's collection, but it's likely that if you weren't already interested, this won't change your mind.","A Dutch radio session is the source here for the band'sÂ hushed, glacial sound.

The Roots of El-B,El-B,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46d9d034d5c69bf3079/1:1/w_160/f4d4bf8e.jpg,2009-06-17 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13095-the-roots-of-el-b/,Tempa,"Buyer beware: A ripped-to-digital copy of The Roots of El-B, run through your off-the-rack laptop, could turn you into one of those fogies lamenting the loss of old-fashioned, around-the-room speaker placement. Dance music always mutates, usually in predictable ways, when repackaged for CD, thanks to all the familiar sonic limitations of home playback devices. (No earbuds will ever work as proper bass bins when they're not even designed with the same net effect in mind.) The dance fan makes peace that she's buying a compromised product, or at least something she has to learn to hear and enjoy minus the thick, 3-D depth of a really sweet club sound system. This cruel squishing of nuance is old news to anyone who owns more than one single-artist singles collection purchased from the electronic section. And The Roots of El-B could potentially suffer more than most, because this is gloriously thick, 3-D, nuanced dance music. El-B is one of several pseudonyms adopted by UK producer Lewis Beadle in the late 1990s/early 00s, the moment when serious-minded dubstep first threatened to secede from London's happy-go-lucky garage culture. For a time, El-B was a master of taking UK garage's bright and peppy grooves and perverting them with slow, mean, overwhelming basslines. It was a low-end sound that was mechanically alienating, like wobbling bursts of between-stations radio fuzz squeezed and molded until fat and spherical. But El-B also loved a free-flowing, almost formless sensation of pure weight, holding a flame to the coiling b-lines of Jamaican dub until the shape melted away. Unfortunately, pace my opening graf, you're going to get only a pale approximation of this totalizing oomph, of how these basslines could feel like concrete slowly setting in the spaces between dancers. Thankfully El-B also produced what so many of his dubstep-identified followers did (or could) not: gloriously intricate rhythms, their brittle timbre just about perfect for the thin top-end that's usually the bane of the bargain stereo. Each tune is built on a dizzying drum track, uniform in their post-jungle approach to fractured but tightly arranged rhythm, but never same-y sounding like the dullest two-step drum'n'bass. A jerking or clonking kick drum reminds you this is body music, while El-B swings severely syncopated hi-hats and snares that verge on disorienting if followed too closely. He then maps out every remaining millisecond-sized nook and cranny between the tautly stitched beats, and somehow finds room for horns (""Express""), vocal samples (""Lyrical Tempo""), and a myriad of little percussion flourishes (just about every track). El-B's genius is in, say, the way he keeps throwing maddening did-I-actually-just-hear-that? offbeats and rhythmic feints into the mesh of jazzy brass stabs and garage drums on ""Among the Stars"", while keeping things orderly enough to suit dancers who don't have the luxury of hitting rewind to pick apart his grooves for a second or third time. The tidiness of his micro-edited rhythms means some of the tracks could sound repetitive, rather than hypnotic, on first listen. Crank a seemingly static track like ""Digital"", however, and all of a sudden you notice how elastically the bassline stretches around and between the implacable snare cracks. The slithers of cymbal and spasms of snare that add little spikes of energy to a groove that might otherwise drag. The patiently layered horror movie synth drones, blowing over the groove like cold winds. While The Roots of El-B isn't all ""dark swing,"" to use a phrase bandied around the scene for a minute before ""dubstep"" finally stuck, it is helpful to remember that Beadle was one of the key producers in (for better or worse) moving UK garage away from the sugary, full-vocal pop remixes of its crossover heyday. Like many dance music full-lengths, The Roots of El-B demands devotion to pure rhythm, a willingness to trade songs for the percussive arrangement of pure sound, rewarding your fealty to syncopation more richly than most.","One of the stars of UKG and progenitors of dubstep gets a well-deserved Soul Jazz comp treatment.

The Archives Vol. 1: 1963-1972,Neil Young,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bfea9e61561daa4fa6/1:1/w_160/bf630955.jpg,2009-06-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13164-the-archives-vol-1-1963-1972/,Reprise,"In the wake of Bob Dylan's successful 1985 expanded anthology Biograph, it seemed like every rock artist of note was lining up for CD box-set canonization. And true to his reputation as a futurist, David Bowie tried to outdo them all with 1989's Sound + Vision, which supplemented the usual greatest-hits-plus-rarities format with a bonus disc of visual content that would showcase the glorious new CD-Video format. There was only one problem with his attempt to revolutionize the box set: no one knew what the hell a CD-Video disc was, let alone owned any kind of device that would allow one to view it. It was around this same time that Neil Young started talking up an ambitious career-retrospective project called Archives, and given the amount of unreleased songs Young routinely dusted off in his concerts, fans had come to expect nothing less than a parallel-universe repertoire every bit as rich and deep as his official one-- a Decade to last for decades. But as gleaned by anyone who's gone to a Neil Young show expecting to hear the hits but treated to an hour of Greendale instead, being a Neil fan requires a certain amount of patience. Twenty years since its first public mention, Archives has gone on to usurp even Chinese Democracy as the ultimate lost-album punchline. But the long-delayed arrival of this first volume seems less a matter of archeology as technology. And like the Bowie box, there's some confusion about how exactly you're supposed to use the thing. Neil Young is an odd sort of perfectionist, favoring a raw immediacy in his recordings that often means leaving the mistakes in for purity's sake, but he's obsessed with making sure those mistakes are mixed and mastered to sometimes unattainable standards of fidelity. (He refused to release arguably his finest album, 1974's On the Beach, on CD until 2003 for this reason.) So it appears that the advent of Blu-ray HD audio technology was the missing piece that has allowed Neil to realize his multimedia masterplan for Archives. What little public comment he's made about Archives' release has taken the form of evangelical praise for the medium, urging fans to adopt the new technology like a Best Buy salesman working on commission. The first volume of Archives arrives as a 10-disc set, spanning the first 10 years of Young's career and, somewhat confusingly, three different formats. For the most ardent audiophiles, there's the $300 multimedia-enhanced Blu-ray edition that includes six compilation discs; the previously released Live at the Fillmore East and Live at Massey Hall; an additional solo concert recorded in 1969 at the Riverboat coffeehouse in Toronto (though it boasts a tracklist similar to last year's Live at Canterbury House set, also included here as an unlisted bonus throw-in); the first DVD release of Young's infamous tour-documentary-cum-existential-road-flick, Journey Through the Past; plus online-update capabilities through which users will have access to more material. For equally fervent fans (and Pitchfork reviewers) with inferior home-entertainment set-ups, there's a $200 version boasting all of the above musical and multimedia content in a DVD format. And for those who just want some Neil on-hand in the car to soundtrack future road trips forevermore, there's a basic eight-disc $100 CD box with all the tunes but none of the extras. (All versions come with mp3 download codes, though we all know how Neil feels about iPods.) Regardless of the format, each version of Archives makes the same convincing case: For Neil Young, the years of 1963 to 1972 were marked by a rapid maturation and a series of successful stylistic reinventions that rivaled the Beatles. Starting out as the surf-rockin' frontman for Winnipeg garage combo the Squires, he quickly transitioned into the folkie busker cutting early demos of ""Sugar Mountain"" for Elektra Records in 1965; the wide-screened psychedelic visionary in Buffalo Springfield; the savage electric warrior of 1969's Crazy Horse debut, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere; the heroic hippie wingman for Crosby, Stills and Nash; and then the country-rock traditionalist of 1970's After the Gold Rush and 1972's Harvest. On top of summarizing a tidy 10-year span, Archives Vol. 1 ends symbolically with Neil at his commercial peak, before a growing disillusionment with rock stardom and the death of close friends would usher in a more darkly compelling phase of his career. But while they're paying the least amount of money, the CD-box purchasers may feel the most short-changed, as Archives is not quite the vault-clearing revelation that fans may have been hoping for. Of the advertised 43 unreleased tracks, most take the form of alternate mixes or live versions of familiar material, ranging from the subtle (a cavernous mix of ""Helpless"" that enhances the song's hymnal qualities) to the substantial (early stripped-down versions of ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere"" and future On the Beach track ""See the Sky About to Rain""). But as Archives attests, the lack of true, unheard rarities can be explained by the fact that Neil's been pulling from his mythical stash of lost songs since the mid-60s, padding his 70s and 80s releases with songs (""Winterlong"", ""Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown"", ""Wonderin'"") written during this early era. So in a purely musical sense, Archives' real selling point isn't so much the tracklist as the remastering. And make no doubt about it: Next to the budget-line CD issues that Reprise rushed to the market in the late 80s, the new versions sound spectacular, breathing new life into these old warhorses. (The swirling symphonics of Harvest's ""A Man Needs a Maid"", in particular, beg for a big pair of headphones and an easy chair.) However, one can't help but question why these remasters can only be accessed via an expensive box set rather than through individual album reissues. With so many songs here already familiar to even the most casual classic-rock radio listener, the most illuminating moments on Archives come from the less celebrated tracts of his career. For one, the Squires tracks provide not just a time-capsule snapshot of Neil's first recording forays; rather, songs like the wonderful ""I'll Love You Forever"" provide glimpses of an unrealized future as a Beatlesque balladeer. (Alternately, the twangy instrumental ""Mustangs"" could pass for vintage Meat Puppets.) And if the turn-of-the-70s triumvirate of Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After the Gold Rush, and Harvest became the go-to soundtracks for America's post-hippie hangover, Neil's comparatively overlooked 1969 self-titled debut feels all the more contemporary for being excluded from that classic-rock holy trinity, boasting a soft-rock lushness that-- in light of psychedelic successors like the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and Sparklehorse-- has proven as influential as any album in his canon. But as Archives' multitude of newspaper clippings and radio interview excerpts explain, it was Neil's dissatisfaction with that first album's textured production and mastering that made him go folk/rock (not to be confused with folk-rock), and though they're already been released, the Massey Hall and Fillmore sets still represent this era's purest manifestations of those acoustic/electric extremes. The 1969 Riverboat disc, however, is less about what Neil does during the songs (acoustic readings of his first-album and Springfield catalogues) as between them: he talks. A lot. So much so that the these between-song ""raps"" constitute their own bonus feature on the Riverboat disc-- perhaps inspired by one-time tour-mate Thurston Moore's similar verbal deconstruction of a Venom live album-- with a stream of amusing anecdotes about groupies, drugs and the Guess Who. In the same sense, Archives is ultimately less interesting when seen as a compilation of music than as a digital storehouse of a man's complete life and work. Taken individually, the reams of extras that accompany every track on the DVD/Blu-ray editions-- candid photos, original handwritten lyric sheets, radio-promo spots, newspaper clippings, tape-box doodles, and so on-- may not seem like a compelling reason to pony up for Archives' enhanced options. But cumulatively, they chart an evolution as intriguing as that heard in the songs. Given that Neil's become rather media-shy in his old age, Archives provides an opportunity to track his transformation as a public figure through the many newspaper articles and radio-interview clips gathered here, from the wide-eyed teenager promoting his club night in the Winnipeg daily to the disgruntled Buffalo Springfield exile trashing Jimmy Messina's mixing job on that band's last record (early evidence of Neil's notorious audiophilia) to the self-described ""rich hippie"" contemplating the peculiarities of fame just as Harvest is about to make him a superstar. And the (mostly hidden) video teases sprinkled throughout the set-- like CSNY performing ""Down By the River"" on a David Steinberg-hosted teen dance show, or rare glimpses of the long-gone Riverboat-- culminate with a treasure trove of footage on Archives' final disc. Here we get a series of intimate interviews conducted during Harvest's farmhouse recording sessions, as well as Archives' most amusing easter egg find: a 15-minute sequence where Neil discovers CSNY bootlegs during a record-shopping trip circa 1971, sparking a heated argument with the store employee that culminates in Neil walking out of the shop, bootlegs in hand, without paying for them. (The sequence is especially resonant in light of Neil's recent endorsement of Warner Music Group pulling all their artists' videos off YouTube.) Taken together, Archives' musical and visual material form as complete a picture of Neil Young's early years as the most die-hard fan could hope for. But therein lies the fundamental flaw of Archives on DVD-- you can't take them together. Each track is housed in a virtual file folder that allows you to play the audio track or scour the bonus content; there is no way to do them simultaneously. So your options are either to let the music play uninterrupted (while your screen displays serene film loops of spinning record players and reel-to-reel machines), or exit ""play"" mode and silently sift through the extras-- without being able to actually listen to the song those extras are meant to contextualize. It's like being told that your computer can run iTunes, or your web browser, but you have to shut down one to use the other. It means you end up spending as much time fiddling with your DVD menu controls as enjoying the material you're trying to access. You have to spring for the Blu-ray to access different pieces of media simultaneously. Brian Eno was recently quoted as saying that if the practice of selling music in physical form is to continue, the emphasis will have to shift from the content to the form, to enable a unique user experience that can't be replicated with the click of a mouse. Archives constitutes a bold step towards this new paradigm, where the delivery system is as much in service to the supplemental materials as the music that ephemera serves to canonize. And for all its multimedia chicanery, Archives ultimately seeks to reassert an old-fashioned mode of attentive listening and engagement that's been mostly lost as music becomes a WiFi-streamed soundtrack to some other activity. But if Neil expects his fans to retain their enthusiasm for future volumes (particularly when the focus shifts to his erratic 80s output), he'll need to make that immersion process more fluid, less disruptive. Certainly Archives' first volume contains enough audio and visual stimuli to keep a Neil Young fan busy till the next edition arrives (presumably) in 2029. But that's as much a comment on the impractical, time-consuming interface as the content itself.","Twenty years since its first public mention,Â Archives-- covering 1963-72--Â finally arrives as a 10-disc multimedia set available on DVD or Blu-ray.

Command,Client,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4efb1335d7bf1698aa3/1:1/w_160/fc88329c.jpg,2009-06-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13208-command/,Out of Line,"Great poetry, it's been said, contains more information than political speeches. Because in a really creative poem, you never know what's coming next. So like, a film by Orson Welles contains more information than other films of its day, because nobody else would shoot their scenes in exactly the same way. Sad to say, Client are not their generation's chilly UK electro-pop version of Orson Welles. In fact, Client have basically defined themselves by withholding information-- from their anti-image image to their repetive, generic, but nonetheless well-constructed and hooky music. Core duo Kate Holmes and Sarah Blackwood originally took on the code names Client A and Client B because they didn't want to be known as, respectively, the wife of former Creation Records chief Alan McGee and the former singer for 1990s British act Dubstar. That's understandable. On fourth album Command, Client race toward goth night at your local disco, with Killing Joke's Youth (fresh off a collaboration with Sir Paul McCartney) and the Sneaker Pimps' Joe Wilson splitting production duties. Look at the cover art, though: The uniform has changed, but Client are still proudly faceless. That's understandable, too-- not for nothing did Client cover Adam and the Ants' cynical post-punk side ""Zerox"" on 2007's slightly more rocking Heartland-- but their lack of a discrete identity also makes for pretty forgettable albums. Vague lyrics continue to be a sticking point, and it doesn't help that they repeat what few lyrics they have over and over again. Why, the screeching ""Satisfaction"" and faster, more dancefloor-ready ""Blackheart"" even use their first verses twice. That the lyrics consist of phrases like ""junkie love, junkie love"", on opener ""Your Love Is Like Petrol"", or ""fucked-up music sounds so fresh"", on next track ""Can You Feel""-- and that they're often spoken unexpressively rather than sung-- probably won't attract many new fans. Whatever makes Client so lacking in personality isn't just the lyrics, however. When they cover Curtis Mayfield's ""Make Me Believe in You"", the words are still fairly rote-- ""You are my temptation/ Show me inspiration""-- but the frosty Eurodisco rendition doesn't give you much reason to seek this one out instead of Amerie's faithful 2007 cover, let alone Patti Jo's Tom Moulton-remixed 1973 soul jam. (Is it better than Duffy's awfully similar neo-soul hit ""Mercy"", though? Maybe.) Still, the problem can't be the craftsmanship, which is consistently excellent, whether in the glam stomp of ""Son of a Gun"" or woozy dream-pop of ""In My Mind"". Chugging, midtempo tracks like ""Don't Run Away"" and ""Ghosts"", arguably the catchiest songs here, recall the slick mid-1990s electro-rock of Butch Vig's Garbage, for better and worse. Biggest bummer of all: The timing was right for a late-career breakthrough. Client were never as glamorous as Goldfrapp, never as shrill and willing to experiment as Adult., never as shoegaze-indebted and affecting as Ladytron. But when it comes to contemporary peers like Little Boots and La Roux, Command's minimalist songwriting and high-end production don't put them far behind. It's just that, once again, Client's fondness for anonymity threatens to keep them that way. If I'm repeating past reviews here, well, does this look like great poetry?","Ex-Dubstar singer and Alan McGee spouse return with their fourth album of frosty Eurodisco.

Embrace,Sleepy Sun,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a470b1335d7bf169896e/1:1/w_160/62f2a328.jpg,2009-06-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13098-embrace/,ATP,"Eddie Van Halen once remarked that the most amazing thing about Led Zeppelin was that, for a band often cited as the godfathers of heavy metal, so much of their repertoire was acoustic. Theirs was a reputation built not on being the loudest band all the time, but rather at just the right time. It's a lesson that San Francisco-via-Santa Cruz sextet Sleepy Sun have taken to heart-- their debut album, Embrace, dispenses its earth-quaking riffage in such carefully measured, perfectly spaced-out rations, it tricks you into thinking the band is much heavier than it actually is. Their long hair, nature-kid press photos and onstage face paint seemingly align Sleepy Sun with San Fran's tie-dyed tradition, but the band's palette is actually smeared with a whole lotta Blacks: Sabbath, Mountain (whose producer, Colin Stewart, works the boards here), Angels and-- when singer Bret Constantino busts out a boogie-summoning wail on ""Snow Goddess""-- even the Crowes. But if the opening ""New Age"" establishes Sleepy Sun as archetypal stoner-rockers-- with Constantino's vaporous vocals floating atop a subterranean fuzz bassline, molten guitar leads, and drum fills that roll right off of Bill Ward's tom-tom rack-- the song's follow-up, the surprisingly affecting piano-based spiritual ""Lord"", shows the group has designs on writing songs that still move you after the drugs wear off, and that Constantino can be the sort of emotionally assertive vocalist who doesn't always have to hide behind the haze. The rest of Embrace plays up that oppositional tension-- namely, the question of whether Sleepy Sun will follow unruly acid-rock trailblazers like Comets on Fire down the volcano (as suggested by the sudden fuzz-punk eruption of ""Red/Black""), or clean up their act and join fellow reverb junkies My Morning Jacket in the Dark Was the Night-tier indie ivory tower (see: the paisley-hued pastorale ""Golden Artifact"", wherein the band's former standing as a Fleet Foxes opening act makes most sense). To their credit, Sleepy Sun never let on as to which way they're going to lean, and seemingly build their centerpiece track ""White Dove"" as a monument to their own contradictory mystique. Clocking in at over nine minutes, it's the song that all the others here are in service to, capturing the band at their most sludgy and sinister before eventually fading into a blissed-out psych-folk denouement. And in the middle of it all: a drum solo. But then that's just the sort of 1970s-reverent gesture you'd expect from a group of hippies who, as of last year, were generously giving this album away for free over the Internet, but probably agreed to issue it on a proper label just so they could hear it on vinyl.","San Fran-via-Santa Cruz sextet dispenses earth-quaking riffage in measured, spaced-out rations, tricking you into thinking it's heavier than it actually is.

Rhett Miller,Rhett Miller,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4769d034d5c69bf308a/1:1/w_160/53541133.jpg,2009-06-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13102-rhett-miller/,Shout! Factory,"Juggling a band and a solo career can be a tricky proposition. If these projects sound too different, people might think you have a problem with the group. Sound too similar, and people might think, well, what's the point? Fortunately Rhett Miller, frontman for the Old 97's and solo artist, has managed to strike a fine balance between the two, slightly favoring Texas country with the former and more sophisticated L.A. pop with the latter.Â Indeed, L.A. pop savant Jon Brion produced and played on Miller's (relative) solo breakthrough, The Instigator, contributed to its follow-up, The Believer, and pops up all over Miller's self-titled fourth disc, even if the much of the disc was crafted in Dallas. Clocking in at a hair under 40 minutes, Rhett Miller falls toward the mellower end of the power-pop spectrum, which is to say it's impeccably crafted and heavy on tasteful tunesmithery. How much you'll enjoy this leans on one's interest in forlorn romanticism (""Haphazardly""), British Invasion nods (""Nobody Says I Love You Anymore""), and good ol' jangle-pop (the Marshall Crenshaw-rific ""If It's Not Love"" and ""I Need to Know Where I Stand"").Â No surprises there, but Miller does shake things up now and again: On ""Happy Birthday Don't Die"", he unleashes his inner Robyn Hitchcock, paying homage to his fellow Largo buddy with a weird, rollicking sci-fi glimpse into the future. On ""Bonfire"", he paints a more restrained, lullaby-like portrait rife with enigmatic portent. That he sounds equally comfortable at both extremes is a testament to his restraint-- even at its most ornate, the album thankfully keeps the distracting bells and whistles to a minimum, in turn keeping the focus on the songs. Speaking of songs, Miller's claimed that much of the album was informed by the death of his grandmother as well as the suicide of David Foster Wallace (whom he considered a hero), but any shadow hanging over the disc is subtle at best, especially since Miller can't resist pairing bittersweet lyrics with peppier tunes, as he does in ""Like Love"" and ""Caroline"". On the other hand, the sweet ""Sometimes"", rather than drawing from some dark corner of Miller's subconscious world, was apparently inspired by a melody hummed by his two-year old daughter in her crib, and fittingly it's a song more likely to inspire ""aww""s than awe. Like much of Rhett Miller, and unlike much oft-unctuous power pop, it's music seemingly made to softly impress rather than outright inspire. Maybe that's the Texan in Miller at work, making the case that, whenever in doubt, it's best to sacrifice flash and err on the side of modesty. The disc's tasteful to a fault, but at least you can't fault his good taste.","Old 97's leader returns with another solo album that leans more toward sophisticated pop rather than his band's country tinged sound.

Underwaterpeoples Records Showcase,Various Artists,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ac13d1975652138d79/1:1/w_160/e8bf60b9.jpg,2009-06-16 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13147-underwaterpeoples-records-showcase/,Underwater Peoples,"To many music fans, pleasantness is low on the list of reasons to like or dislike a band or artist-- no match for originality or adventurousness. But even if ""nice sounds"" is something of a dirty phrase in the indie lexicon, there is, of course, a place for pleasant music when it's done right.Â Enter Underwater Peoples, a Washington, D.C.-based boutique imprint that joins similarly minded labelsÂ Acephale (Memory Cassette, Air France) and Sincerely Yours (the Tough Alliance, um, Air France)-- plus marquee artistsÂ Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend-- by offering quality indie music that also happens to sound really good. Home to blog-friendly bands Real Estate and Ducktails, the label has seen an uptick in interest over the past few months for its development of a lo-fi, beachy aesthetic via the signing of a dozen or so groups scattered across the country all trafficking in and around this general style. This nicely varied and well-sequenced compilation-- originally offered as a free download through sites friendly with Underwater Peoples-- rounds up tracks by most of those artists for a collection that might as well be called Endless Summer. This is music that seems to have been developed specifically for flip-flopped backyard barbecues, sun-baked roadtrips, and beachfront campfires (song titles ""Banana Jam Pt. 1"", ""Backyard"", and ""Beach Comber"" tell you as much right off the bat). Just take a look at that album cover-- the hazy, soft-focus lighting, a rubber ducky, some guy straight relaxing in a suburban Playboy-style grotto. That dude is chilling. And that's kind of the point here: establishing a seasonal mood, a supine vibe that exists throughout the entire record. Perhaps more importantly, the compilation also helps to define Underwater Peoples' signature style, a sort of a crusty amalgam of the current strain of CSNY-leaning underground Americana, classic mid-nineties guitar indie, and the more experimental tropical collage-pop of Panda Bear and El Guincho, to a lesser degree. But even for the kinda-sorta adventurous moments here-- occasional bits of sampling and vocal looping, for instance-- the clear priorities are simplicity and tunefulness, and the best songs feature both in spades. Despite its cringe-worthy title, Frat Dad's ""Brosef"" is accomplished indie rock that nicely balances the mournful longing of its group-sung chorus with filthier, ramshackle verses. Sexier and more rhythmic than just about anything that can be slapped with a ""white-guy indie"" tag nowadays, Family Portrait's excellent ""Mega Secrets"" is even more successful, and it's got just enough of a scuzz coating to keep it from parting ways with the rest of the lo-fi-ish stuff around it. And New Jersey-based songwriter Liam the Younger provides further highlights with a pair of acoustic numbers that also represent the album's most outwardly folk moments. On ""Country Wide"", his quavering vocals emphasize a somber-but-hopeful quality that gives the track emotional depth beyond its simple Appalachian strumming. The remainder of the Underwater Peoples compilation is divided between several subgenres that each fall somewhere under the larger umbrella of this brand of homespun summertime pop. Slower, dirge-y instrumentals by Ducktails, more classically surf-inspired Animal Collective-leaning tunes from Pill Wonder, and Sad City's breezy patchwork pop all fare well here. (Almost surprisingly, for a group of mostly unknown artists on a label probably too small to distribute its own CDs, there are only a few songs here that don't fit or feel superfluous.) All of these tracks rely more on a vibe than heady creative concepts, but they nail that vibe. They're all unapologetically pleasant. And that might end up being the album's biggest selling point and its Achilles heel-- it won't expand your musical horizons and might not end up on your year-end list, but you'll listen to it a lot and enjoy it... a lot. And, hey, there's nothing wrong with that.","Like a U.S. indie rock version of Sweden's Sincerely Yours, this comp, full ofÂ homespun pop, is at its best a wonderful collection of summer night sounds.

1 Record / Radio City,Big Star,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a473c0084474cd0c04c0/1:1/w_160/b9413ce8.jpg,2009-06-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13101-1-record-radio-city/,StaxArdent,"This is not a reissue of an album, but of a product. In 1992, Ardent/Fantasy released the first two Big Star records-- #1 Record (1972) and Radio City (1974)-- on one CD, which at the time seemed like a generous rescue project for two influential cult albums that were out of print in every format. Included were liner notes by pop historian Brian Hogg and journalist Rick Clark, along with a couple of fuzzy black-and-white photos of the band and a tear-off mail-in survey. For a Big Star newcomer with limited cash but a voracious musical appetite, it was a dream-- not simply more bang for your buck, but an instantly immersive introduction to the band. However, the decision to re-release this ""2 Complete Original Albums on 1 CD"" set is questionable, not least because it is a slavish reprinting of the original. There's no mail-in survey this time around, but the reissue preserves the crowded layout of the original, except the digital printing is just above Xerox quality and the images even fuzzier than before. Just how little effort went into this re-release? The running time for both albums is still listed in the little red box as 73:00, despite the addition of two bonus single mixes that push running time closer to 80:00. If this double release once benefited the first-time buyer, it ill serves the music itself, compacting two very different albums into one long, awkward retrospective. #1 Record showcases the collaborative songwriting of Chris Bell and Alex Chilton, who fashioned themselves as Memphis' own Lennon-McCartney. They alternate vocals between Bell's sandpapery rasp and Chilton's smooth falsetto (which doesn't even sound like it emanates from the same throat as those Box Tops vocals), and the result is one of power-pop's defining records. ""The Ballad of El Goodo"" takes as its refrain a line from an old spiritual-- ""There ain't no one going to turn me 'round""-- which had become locally prominent as a civil rights slogan. The Big Star song is both tough and tender, communal and individual-- and genuinely moving without knowledge of its origins. #1 Record is shot through with an adolescent romanticism that kicks off in the restless energy of ""In the Street"", with its infectious guitar lick and rebel poetry lyrics and culminates on the Chilton-sung ""Thirteen"", an aching acoustic evocation of teenage angst. Despite the reported hostility between them, Bell and Chilton are both strong presences on #1 Record, but their partnership was short-lived. Bell left the band shortly after the album's release and commercial failure, which made Big Star essentially a solo project for Chilton. So Radio City is a very different record. The transition between #1 Record closer ""ST 100/6"" and Radio City opener ""O My Soul"" was always jarring, but it's made worse by the addition of the single mix of ""In the Street"", which was originally the B-side to ""When My Baby's Beside Me"". Like the shortened mix of ""O My Soul"" that ends the new set, it's more interesting historically than musically. On Radio City, Chilton, bass player Andy Hummel, and drummer Jody Stephens emphasize rhythm as much as melody, especially with the snaky guitars of opener ""O My Soul"", which hint at the singer's later fascination with old R&B sounds. It's still a pop record, and ""She's a Mover"" and ""Mod Lang"" might be their most Anglophilic moments ever. And then there's ""Back of a Car"", ""You Get What You Deserve"", and ""September Gurls""-- one perfect pop gem after another that blur the line between album and singles band. In fact, Radio City is simultaneously a grab for airplay and sales and the beginning of Chilton's musical entrenchment that would continue through Third/Sisters Lovers (a Big Star album in name only) and into his solo career. More than that, it is the adult counterpart to its adolescent predecessor, forgoing the debut's single-minded intensity for a more nuanced mix of emotions ranging from jaded (""You Get What You Deserve"") to resigned (""Back of a Car"") to sentimental (""I'm in Love with a Girl""). For many listeners-- including, for a few years, me-- Big Star were more legend than band. They were the beloved patron saints for struggling musicians: These albums were inspired and inspiring but never found a wide audience, yet the fact that they eventually became so revered offered encouragement to young songwriters with their own dream of big stardom and No. 1 records. Even if you never found an audience in your prime, you could always hope for later cult success. And to some extent, of course, the myth overtook the music, which means these two albums tend to be slightly overrated. #1 Record begins to lag on side two, and Hummel's ""The India Song"" remains imminently skippable (I once tried to convince myself that it was a parody of Beatles mysticism, but that's wishful thinking). Similarly, the complexity of Radio City often masks an elusiveness that dogs Chilton even today. Even so, I would argue that such flaws make these albums all the more fascinating and endearing: ""ST 100/6"" is surely someone's favorite Big Star song, and Chilton's evasiveness made him a cult figure apart from Big Star. That only makes the redundancy of this set all the more egregious: there's no sense of engaging with these records anew, no attempt to determine what they might mean now as opposed to what they meant 16 years ago. It may still be a useful introduction to Big Star, but it still stings as a major mishandling of a cult-canonical catalog, especially when Stax/Concord is releasing such handsome and informative reissues of Isaac Hayes' contemporaneous albums. On the other hand, the label is also issuing both Big Star albums individually on vinyl, which seems intended for those one-time newcomers who've grown to cherish both #1 Record and Radio City as totems of lost youth but who will view this shabby set as merely a relic of the CD Age.","Once a crucial 2-for-1 reissue, this new version of Big Star's classic, disparate records adds nothing to their legacy or discography.

En Hand I Himlen,Jonathan Johansson,by: Stephen M.

But in a very short time, the country's indie output-- at least as perceived from these shores-- seems to have advanced two decades, with acts like the Legends and Pacific! finding inspiration in the sounds of the early 1980s. In this regard, Jonathan Johansson is a new romantic, but not necessarily a New Romantic. He doesn't dress outlandishly or portray himself as particularly androgynous, but that label (those two words divorced of their pop-historical meaning) nicely sum up the bruised emotionalism and chilly synthcraft of his Swedish-language debut, En hand i himlen (which translates roughly toÂ ""A Hand in the Sky""). On these ten songs, he sounds resolutely downcast, but with a stubborn optimism only a true romantic could feel, with his heart on his sleeve and heavy thoughts on his mind. In reviving these old sounds, Johansson locates a compelling paradox: His music communicates emotions so acute they can be conveyed only with the most coldly mechanistic instruments available. Johansson and multi-instrumentalist Johan Eckeborn erect an enormous wall of electronic sound on En hand i himlen, with each song demonstrating new tricks. The title track is densely layered around an ""and"" beat snare pattern, building into soaring choruses and fading away into softer verses. Corkscrew synths etch a delicate melody throughout the downcastÂ ""Innan vi faller"", whose mopiness is offset by its graceful segue into the relatively upbeatÂ ""HÃ¶gsta taket, hÃ¶gsta vÃ¥ningen"". Johansson and Eckeborn create different textures and tones from their machines, but track to track there is an ebb and flow that makes En hand i himlen play seamlessly. ""Sent fÃ¶r oss"", pushed along by a frantic bass rhythm, charges along at a fast clip into the stark ""Du sa"", which sounds austere but not antiseptic. With a sprinting drumbeat that threatens to leave the performers behind, ""SÃ¤g vad ni vill"" provides the album's climax and an opportunity for Johansson to show off his surprisingly agile voice, which moves effortlessly from wounded to triumphant, from a low whisper to a falsetto that almost sounds indistinguishable from the synths themselves. One song obviously stands out, although its title gives few clues.Â ""Alla vill ha hela vÃ¤rlden""Â translates toÂ ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", and yes, it's a Tears for Fears cover. Johansson doesn't mess with the original much beyond singing in Swedish-- this isn't a Gary Jules-style makeover-- and while the choice may be obvious, the song fits well enough on the album, finding a balance between defiant and resigned, between introverted and extroverted. Johansson may be playing off certain early 80s styles and signifiers on En hand i himlen, but on this impressive debut, he never sounds merely imitative. Instead, he cribs from that decade only to suit his own emotional, expressive ends.","Swedish songwriter is a new romantic (not a New Romantic), with aÂ bruised emotionalism and chilly synthcraft (but not ruffled shirts or heavy eyeliner).

Tape Chants,Gregg Kowalsky,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b613d1975652138d90/1:1/w_160/fa404ddf.jpg,2009-06-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13156-tape-chants/,Kranky,"The concept behind Gregg Kowalsky's ""Tape Chants"" performance is simple yet fascinating. Looking to break away from computer-based methods, the Oakland-based composer turned to cassette tapes. After recording various source material (piano, percussion, sinewave oscillators, etc) onto cassettes, Kowalsky would play them on mono tape players around a room and vary the volume levels of each. ""Depending on where each member of the audience is located, they will hear the piece slightly differently than the person next to them,"" he explains in the press materials for Tape Chants. This unique performance process lies somewhere between the early phase experiments of Steve Reich and the ""third ear"" psycho-acoustic work of Maryanne Amacher. It also provokes the question of whether Kowalsky could create as interesting an experience on record. He admits that Tape Chants, his second full-length for Kranky, ""does not try to replicate the surround sound component of the live performances."" But he used a similar process to make these pieces, adding what he calls ""rhythmic textures"" to the tape mixing. The result is a set of well-crafted drones that fans of the Kranky catalogue or any other ambient music should appreciate. The uniqueness of the live show, however, doesn't come across here. You can tell a lot of work went into Kowalsky's music, but you can't really tell what kind of work. So without the visuals or three-dimensionality of the performance, Kowalsky's drones have to suffice on their own. And they pretty much do. Tape Chants opens with ""Invocation"", a minute-long track of tactile, engine-rev drone. But Kowalsky stumbles by following that with his least interesting (and longest) piece. ""I-IV"" lasts for 21 minutes, and a good portion of that is taken up by motionless, organ-like tones. Of course, a lot of good drone can be described that way, but here the stasis isn't counterbalanced by enough sonic texture or variety. About halfway through, a bassy rhythm takes hold in the background, giving the track a distinct boost. But even that element never quite gathers steam or rises into something new, and ""I-IV"" could have been as interesting-- maybe even more so-- at a third of its length. The rest of Tape Chants is more varied, and more engaging. Kowalsky's drones get denser and moodier as they progress, gathering sonic dust and debris to become more like field recordings than studio compositions. On ""VI-VII"", his tones begin with a sandy hue, then drift into low-end rumble and what sounds like acoustic string plucks. In contrast to ""I-IV"", this piece is busy and active, with different strains of sound humming alongside each other like insects. The same goes for the ultra-quick ""VIII""-- less than a minute of phasey, tactile howl-- and especially ""IX"", whose thick, piano-ish echo conjures thoughts of Labradford scoring a grainy horror film. It's moments like that in which Kowalsky's process takes a back seat to the end result. Don't come here expecting all Labradford-style cinematics, though. Kowalsky's work so far is mostly for hardcore drone-fans, and even they might not be blown away by Tape Chants. But anyone can appreciate Kowalsky's attention to detail, and that thorough approach seems destined to produce a more unique statement-- whatever process it takes to get there.","Looking to break away from computer-based methods, the Oakland-based composer turns to cassette tapes for his latest set of Kranky drones.

Listening Tree,Tim Exile,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c9ea9e61561daa4fbf/1:1/w_160/96fd3f08.jpg,2009-06-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13188-listening-tree/,Warp,"Tim Exile (nÃ© Tim Shaw) was made for the stage, but maybe not the stage you'd expect. Most of Exile's affectations-- billowy low tenor, showy buildups, rugged everyman looks, the glitzy stage name-- all point towards showbiz. The result is that Shaw's third album, and first for Warp, Listening Tree, sometimes sounds like Electronica: The Musical with Shaw playing the sashaying lead. It's occasionally a bit hokey, but Listening Tree trades on Shaw's genre-hopping to build aggressive, kinetic dramas. Any of you crossover kids carrying your new Field record in a Smalltown Supersound tote and accustomed to your electronic music pattering on blissfully, beware: Listening Tree is an album where things properly happen-- lyrically, sure, but also musically. Shaw takes many of his cues from non-linear boom-bappers like Aphex Twin or, if you're looking for someone more theatrical and obscure, Plaid. His compositions spatter and pluck and tumble outwards, each indelicate sound unfurling from another. Listening Tree's songs are so motion-oriented, in fact, that Shaw's Scott-Walker-fronting-the-Human-League vocals often serve as the calming influence. Listening Tree is the first Tim Exile album to play as a fully-formed song cycle, but it's hardly surprising that Shaw, a classically trained violinist who holds a master's degree in electroacoustic composition, would continue to explore his artistic boundaries. The results are mixed. On the slowbeat closer ""I Saw the Weak Hand Fall"", Shaw draws a convincing line between himself and crooners like Dave Gahan or early-90s Bowie. ""Family Galaxy""'s everything-to-everyone pop opera suggests Shaw operates under different rules than most of his electronic peers. On the title track, on the other hand, Shaw limits his feverish mashing, allowing its pounding grandeur to develop naturally. The buzzing, wordless paranoia of ""There's Nothing Left of Me But Her and This"" shows Shaw can still produce the type of earworms he built his reputation on. The verses of ""Bad Dust"" are so cloistered and devilish they'd fit comfortably on a Coil album, but the wide-open choruses just as easily co-opt Smiths-style melodrama: ""I'm lying in the gutter/ Watching stars come crashing down upon my head."" But then, the hokiness. ""Pay Tomorrow"" is four minutes of panging, bass-heavy thwump, warning of the evils of... credit card debt (A chorus: ""Life is such a breeze, we're all so pleased it's got no consequences/ So let's indulge our senses and burn next year's finances""). ""Carouselle"" rallies awkwardly against class inequality and the broken promises of consumerism; think Les MisÃ©rables but with more sequencers and, er, less humor. Put aside for a moment some awkward stance-taking-- hell, it's half-refreshing to hear-- and note that Listening Tree is just an exhausting, demanding listen. Shaw's got the chops to concoct a showy, mutant-electronic opus that tosses genres-- IDM, drum'n'bass, electro-- around like ragdolls, but there's rarely any attention paid to pacing or to textures that exist outside the realm of ear-scraping techno-fabrics. Listening Tree's big-idea stomp is daring, contagious, and commendable. It's a singular sound that's as trying as any of the year's scarier noise records, but it's also uncompromising: a pop-music dealbreaker, even for fiscally responsible, architecturally dashing electro-pop.","Tim Exile's third album and Warp debut trades on his genre-hopping (IDM, drum'n'bass, electro) to build aggressive, kinetic pop dramas.

So Cow,So Cow,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c2c0084474cd0c0571/1:1/w_160/e44d88ff.jpg,2009-06-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13167-so-cow/,Tic Tac Totally,"Nine times outta 10, ""noise pop"" is a misnomer. Guitars sound like crap? No discernible emotional content? Pass the bowl, maan-- that's not music for a pop audience, that's a self-esteem boost for guys who like to hit on tortured girls with Cramps tattoos in record shops. I mean, sure: Plenty of bands, from the Jesus and Mary Chain to the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, really do make noise-drenched pop music. It's just that you can find plenty more bands who make noise-drenched art music, records that reaffirm their buyers' superiority over the unsophisticated rabble (often, without actually being superior). Now, don't get me wrong-- I like a lotta that stuff, too!-- but if you think your average lo-fi/shitgaze scenesters have anything to say to the broaderÂ 21st Century Breakdown-buying, ""American Idol""-watching public, you've been living in Greenpoint too long. And you should sign me to your label. ""I aim to sum up something so neatly that my friend Muiris will go, 'Ah, nicely said,'"" So Cow main man Brian Kelly told the blog Hi-Fi Popcorn last year. ""I like the idea of someone listening and going, 'Ah, that's what I thought!"" If you've ever been young and unlucky in love, the Irish multi-instrumentalist has a song that will strike exactly that kind of emotional chord. Like Television Personalities or the Clean at their most engaging, Kelly plays rickety guitar-pop that sounds homemade without feeling insular. So Cow compiles the best of Kelly's singles and self-released CDs so far, remastered by underground rock luminary Bob Weston. Sing-along hooks and scruffy charm abound. First, though, you'll have to tear yourself away from the best few songs. ""Shackleton"" would be equally perfect for Death Cab fans' mixtapes, Belle and Sebastian fans' weddings, and closing-credit sequences for Chuck Palahniuk film adapations; here Kelly updates the ol' love-songs-about-love-songs trope (cf. the Divine Comedy's ""Perfect Lovesong"", the Lucksmiths' ""Sunlight in a Jar"", Elton John's ""Your Song"") as near-perfectly imperfect organ-and-drum-machine swoon-pop: ""One day I'll write the song you require/ Until then, la la la."" He turns out to be similarly adept at extended adolescence on the off-kilter ""Halcyon Days"", at droney bitching about his life's lack of resemblance to Hollywood romance on ""Casablanca"", and at tender non sequiturs onÂ Pinkerton-style acoustic finale ""To-Do List"" (""a one, a two, a one to-do list...""). You might not know Korean pop star Moon Geun Young, but if you can't relate to the eponymous So Cow song's red-lining tale of an awkward breakup beneath a smiling billboard, well-- such sweet sorrow, I guess. Kelly already has put out two full-length So Cow CDs himself, plus an EP and the occasional single, so it's hard to fault him for wanting to overload his proper debut LP. But for all the easy wit and superabundance of ideas bursting from doomed-love punk-popper ""Greetings"" or wobbly-synth duel ""So Cow vs. the Future"", So Cow would be a more cohesive listen without its fewÂ underwhelming moments-- breakup thrasher ""Normalcy"", maybe, or breakdown ramble ""Exclamation Mark"". And I know Kelly recorded a lot of these songs while living in South Korea, but his lyrics are so sharp that the couple of Korean-language tracks just don't put So Cow's best foot-- hoof? (sorry!)-- forward. Then again, the dreamier ""Ping Pong Rock"", which drops more band names than this review without ever losing sight of a bright melody, shows one way Kelly could get more textural without going all abstract. Listen, nobody understands better than me the impulse to wanna set yourself apart from people who can't see the greatness of, say, Deerhoof or Kirsty MacColl, both of whom So Cow has covered. You know the old punk single ""Whole Wide World"" by Wreckless Eric? Whether you first heard it through John Peel or from that one Will Ferrell movie, So Cow might give you the same type of feeling-- and if you hate this music, at least you won't have to put up with being told you ""don't get it."" That's the art of pop.","Collection of Irish multi-instrumentalist's self-released CDs and singles, compiled and remastered by Bob Weston, is full of sing-along hooks and scruffy charm.

A Bugged Out Mix,Hot Chip,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4cdc0084474cd0c058c/1:1/w_160/a1d8a264.jpg,2009-06-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13185-a-bugged-out-mix-by-hot-chip/,New State,"Perhaps mimicking the structure of your average iTunes playlist, Hot Chip's entry in the Bugged Out mix series, commissioned by the UK dance party organization of the same name, offers one disc of ringing, shuffling techno (Bugged Out) and another, more varied ""summer mix"" (Bugged In). The package presumably offers something for both esoteric dancefloors and somewhat less exclusive July-time vibe fests, though the disjointed nature and the varying quality of the mixes makes the Bugged Out package a bit of a head-scratcher. Bugged Out plays more confrontational and pounding than might be expected from a group last seen translating Half Nelson/Willie Nelson gags into electro-soul balladry. It's tempting, too, to question the utility of the mix, which is only minimally (no pun intended) dance-y, exhibits only sporadic interest in proper transitions, and features plenty of knuckled-over faves. Gas smoothes the opening minutes; Preverlist's ""Junktion"" strangles a middle section; Gabriel Ananda and Dominik Eulberg's ""Eucalypse Now!"" pounds near the end (there's also a track here by Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne). Three minutes of an exclusive Hot Chip track, ""Take It In"", offers a minor incentive. The track rumbles darkly, Alexis Taylor's easy vocals skinning over its carving bass; a nice treat, but rightly exiled in compilation/B-side/mix territory. The mix does pick up some steam, climaxing with the wordless, hazy house of Ican's ""Chiclet's Theme"" before starting slowly, steamily downhill. Closing the set at more than eight minutes, Max Cooper's ""I (Long Version)"" is a bit of a trek (most tracks clock in between two and four minutes), but the hints of optimism buried in its ruby synths are a fine note to close on. Ultimately, Bugged Out camps in the purgatory between ""actual taste-making dance mix"" and ""an interesting mix by artists you enjoy,"" though any indie-rockin' Hot Chip fans looking to explore the engine that propelled ""Ready for the Floor"" might find something to explore here. The wildcard second mix (Bugged In), on the other hand, isn't as concerned with form or function, earning its seasonal peg with a near-schizophrenic but always warming mix of balmy techno, smooth rock, and fluttery other. The set begins abstractly, with the curators' remix of the Pictish Trail's ""Winter Home Disco"" (hell, just ignore the title) but quickly burns through calypso (the Andrews Sisters' unskippable ""Rum & Coca Cola""), hammering techno (Greco-Roman Soundsytem's ""Party Rhythm""), and utter oddity (the Esso Trinidad Steel Band's take on the Kinks' ""Apeman"") before settling into the windchime lull of Osborne's ""16th Stage"". From there Bugged In rolls Man Like Me's ""London Town"" into Fleetwood Mac's ""Love in Store"", whose 8th-note thrum seems like a natural continuation of ""16th Stage"". There are some hokey choices-- we probably don't need the Doobie Brothers' ""What a Fool Believes"", and Dub Narcotic Sound System's ""Shake a Puddin'"" mucks up the momentum-- but even 1980s standards like Hall & Oates' ""I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)"" and Luther Vandross' ""Never Too Much"" feel like natural, light-funk choices (also, re-explore ""Just a Friend"" outside of a beer commercial). Sparks' ""The Number One Song in Heaven"" is such a natural antecedent to Hot Chip's dork-disco that its inclusion feels obvious in hindsight. Bugged In's mix work is still a tad uneven, but no one on your rooftop, or in your Volkswagen, or between your ears will notice, because it plays well anywhere, a slick reminder of Hot Chip's charm and quirk. That it is, however slightly, weighed down by the darker clubroom thump of Bugged Out is responsible for the somewhat depressed score you see above. Make no mistake: Bugged In is worth your poolside July, and doubly so if you're likely to get anything more than ""oh, another decent mix"" out of Bugged Out.","Latest entry in the mix series camps in the purgatory between a taste-making dance set and a more eclectic pop collage.

Rotting Slowly,The Curious Mystery,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48cea9e61561daa4f1f/1:1/w_160/1f6f0cb4.jpg,2009-06-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13120-rotting-slowly/,K,"Oh man, I could really go for some Tex-Mex right about now. New York's mostly meh burrito situation and my still eating 'em all the time anyway aside, when you're a dutiful digital audio consumer, sometimes you've gotta run for the border. Round these parts that usually means Calexico, a Tejano-tinged indie rock group as picturesquely perfect for their fine Tucson, Ariz., as a Saguaro cactus in rosy sunset silhouette. But you can go back as far as you want: If you believe Lester Bangs, Ritchie Valens' ""La Bamba"" begat every punk rock song ever. If you believe fellow critic Chuck Eddy, Babe Ruth's ""The Mexican"" begat every disco song ever. And if you believe rock, punk, disco, all that stuff exists to be contrary, to take people's expectations and give 'em a good poke in the eyeball-- to the point where it's almost not contrary to be contrary anymore-- then you shouldn't even be surprised. Of course, rock would thrive in the desert. Whadda punk. The Curious Mystery aren't from the desert. They're from Seattle. Doesn't matter. As soon as Shana Cleveland starts in with that smoky drawl-- ""If I go blind/ Hangin' out by a riverside/ Just stay with me""-- we're at the base of a rusty gorge with Cat Power on a Mazzy Star-ry night. (By the time Cleveland breaks off for an enigmatic chuckle, 10 tracks in, you're wondering whether she's really a safe person to stay with alone by a riverside on a night such as this.) Nicolas Gonzalez is a javelina-charmer on electric guitar and homemade Theremin. Add drummer Faustine B. Hudson and bass player Bradford Button, and you've got a four-piece doing unhurried psych-blues, autoharp ghost songs, and Area 51 garage-Americana, with plenty of that old frontier promise. Their debut LP might not be exactly what Kurdt Cobain used to expect from K Records-- you noticed the title's Rotting Slowly, right?-- but the Curious Mystery are well within the spirit of former Come frontwoman Thalia Zedek's unsentimental smolder. And when you get right down to it, who's the bigger outlaw: Calvin Johnson, or some schmo who can't drive just 55? Why is Sammy Hagar the one with his own brand of tequila? Nobody ever tells the Grand Canyon to get to the damn point, and at times the Curious Mystery's slow-burning expansiveness helps set a nice acid-Western mood. Instrumentals undergo shifts both rhythmic and dynamic, showcasing Gonzalez's stormy leads, while even at Rotting Slowly's most lyrical, on vivid and forceful standout ""Black Sand"" or the tenderly wasted ""Go Forth and Gather"", the Curious Mystery are rarely far from Beach House's druggy languour. ""You are the type that only moves slowly/ And I am the same,"" Cleveland murmurs on spindly epic ""Outta California"". When she isn't singing, though, these cowboy-junkie dirges tend to drift. And watch out for occasional clumsy overseriousness-- on the Gonzalez-sung ""Strong Swimmers"", with its Sonic Youth dissonance, two people are unlike everybody else in that they can swim, except it turns out they actually can't swim (see, a metaphor can bloom in the desert!). The Curious Mystery have the Southwestern scenery down pretty well. Now they just need to improve the accomodations for us city slickers. A guy can't live on Cabo Wabo alone. ...Or can I?","K Records band doesÂ unhurried psych-blues, autoharp ghost songs, and Area 51 garage-Americana.

Ciao!,Tiga,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e85e6ef9596932099c/1:1/w_160/2130f8ef.jpg,2009-06-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13199-ciao/,PIASLast GangTurbo,"Montreal DJ/producer Tiga doesn't seem particularly interested in the single-single-comp-album-remix-etc. battle plan of your average electronic artist/producer. Sexor, released in 2006, was his first proper album after seven years of DJ mixes and intermittently brilliant cover tracks. Ciao! once again features Soulwax and Jesper Dahlback on production duties, but it adds James Murphy and Jason ""Gonzales"" Beck to the mix, resulting in a more varied album that rarely requires Tiga's (improving) sing/talk voice to carry too much weight. Tiga may not have yet figured out the LP format: the sequencing of Ciao!, which front-loads six bangers before its gauzier second half, is divisive to the point of distraction. But Ciao! also feels more lived-in than 2006's Sexor, which relied on the misguided recurrence of ""Planet Sexor"" and several covers-- long a staple of Tiga's catalog-- to form a song cycle. Ciao! has its silly moments-- I once walked cross-room to my iPod muttering ""please don't be singing 'Sex O'Clock'""; ""Shoes"" might actually owe a debt to Liam Kyle Sullivan's goof of the same name-- but they at least advance the image of Tiga as a Prince-indebted persona capable, at any given moment, of extreme silliness, eroticism, or wistfulness. More importantly, Tiga establishes themes on Ciao! of far greater consequence than ""there is a mythical sex planet."" Ciao! sort of covers a lot of ground, but basically it's a reflection on music and companionship, moving from the emptiness/fulfillment of luxury and sex to holy-shit-the-sun's-up, club-closing malaise. The end-of-album reflection-epic sums it up best: ""Love don't dance here anymore/ Found a new place to go."" Enough of the AP English essay, though: if you're here, it's for Tiga's penchant for busty electro-bangers, and Ciao! provides plenty of dancefloor fodder. (A track like ""Beep Beep Beep"", which rails against the anonymity of modern life before taking comfort in a lover, probably contains too much plot and sentiment for a Tiga song anyhow). ""What You Need"" stands as the best of the album's flossy first half, beginning with a riotous, overloaded squelch and pushing through nearly six minutes of burly dancefloor mash. ""Luxury"" pans a quick, nasal rhythm around a surprisingly virtuoistic keyboard solo. A low-slung, heavily filtered bass plows the way for ""Mind Dimension"", as buzzy and aggressive as anything Crystal Castles muster. The second half of Ciao! features less bodyrock, but its relatively soothed tones and thrumming beats are a surprising fit for Tiga. ""Turn the Night On"", the most ""proper"" pop track Tiga's ever been involved in, juxtaposes rippling arpeggios with clean piano and Tiga's restrained vocals: ""So many choices in the world/ So many boys, so many girls... It's harder than you think."" The whole package sounds a little like an adenoidal Junior Boys song, or maybe an early-80s Lou Reed LP sped to 45 rpm. ""Gentle Giant"", the only song to tack both a writing and a producing credit on James Murphy (he also produced ""Sex O'Clock""), massages loping chords and a hollow, looping electronic drum into what is, by some measure, Tiga's most nakedly heartfelt song: ""Youth don't fail me now/ I need just one last favor/ One song and another dance to let me feel in love tonight."" The 10-plus minute coda ""Love Don't Dance Here Anymore"" threatens tedium with its white-piano balladry before a pulse-quickening sequencer and a tapping tom rechart the song's course. It's a fittingly epic closer for an album, perhaps the surest sign yet that Tiga's interested in crafting cohesive statements, and not just a series of novelties (as fun as Sexor was, there was little evidence that it was more than a diversion from Tiga's singles and deck-work). Tiga's still not a dancefloor chameleon like Basement Jaxx and he's not yet as pop-oriented and clever as say, the Pet Shop Boys, but Ciao! at least sees him glancing in those directions.","Montreal DJ/producer again enlists Soulwax for production assistance while James Murphy contributes songwriting and mixing.

Crossing the Rubicon,The Sounds,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b513d1975652138d8c/1:1/w_160/e493c773.jpg,2009-06-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13155-crossing-the-rubicon/,Original Signal,"The phrase ""crossing the Rubicon"" is, after all, a clichÃ©, and I wish I didn't feel so compelled to point that out right off. I mean, we're talking about a band called the Sounds, so I reckon that sort of thing is, uh, par for the course. But this is the band's third pass at a long-player, and I can't help but bemoan the lack of top-down inventiveness that stares back before you even get a fingernail into the shrinkwrap. It's hard to tell what exactly the Sounds mean by suggesting their new record is some kind of can't-look-back moment, since looking back is precisely what they do, and have been doing their entire career: mining glitzy 1980s power-pop for effortless (and often sorta brainless) hooks. I'd say the point of no return for the Sounds was whatever band meeting found them settling on their moniker. Clearly, overintellectualizing matters isn't really what they set out to accomplish. But if they're putting out this river-crossing business, I've little choice but to offer up a clichÃ© of my own: here, they're treading water. Crossing the Rubicon is a much better album if you don't think much about it; no easy task for a reviewer charged with poring over the finer points, I'll admit, but in the earbud era, not so tough for the casual listener. The Sounds of Crossing the Rubicon are certainly an appealing band on sonics alone, as they have been all along: Synth flourishes and chugging guitars underpin the powerful pipes of Maja Ivarsson at nearly every turn, and while it's short on subtlety, it gets by on pluck. This is shut-up-and-dance music, and that's just about all it ever intended to be. But Rubicon offers the occasional (if frustratingly infrequent) peek behind the curtain, periodic whiffs of more ambition than their pleasure-overload tunes usually suggest, and they're fascinating and frustrating by turns. Fascinating, as this is clearly a formula that needs messing with. Crossing the Rubicon presents 50 minutes of thick-as-a-brick gloss-pop, all peaks and no valleys, nearly every song largely indistinguishable in melody and meter from the one that came before. And frustrating, because when they do make the occasional attempt to stretch out, they don't go far enough for you to notice unless you were paying close attention. The effort's appreciated, but the moments on Crossing the Rubicon that go for something less sprightly-- like the brief title track, which throws a bit more rumble behind their usual fare in a stab at ""epic,"" or the mercifully mood-breaking ballad ""The Only Ones""-- are far from surefooted, whereas the big pop moments kick just like they always have. It's no wonder they keep doing what they do; it works okay, and for a band who still call themselves the Sounds after 10 years and three LPs, it seems okay is what we can expect. Which is not to say Crossing the Rubicon doesn't hold a few highlights, however relative. The ""Rapture""-echoing ""Beatbox"" won't help quell the Blondie comparisons that've followed this lot around since the start (which, usually, have been far too kind), but Ivarsson-- not a strong lyricist by any stretch-- avoids any car-eating chatter, and the song breezes by amicably enough on the strength of its bounce. ""Midnight Sun"" could be a pretty good-sized single, actually, and offers up a fitting mission statement for the band in its first verse: ""Embrace the land where the ocean meets the sand, and emotion fades away."" This is the synth-pop equivalent of Ibiza getaway music: spirited but oddly dispassionate background noise, utility and order Ã¼ber alles. That in mind, I can see myself enjoying it a great deal more were I not thinking about it, writing about it, picking it apart. But that doesn't excuse that this is their third album in this vein; we only needed this one the once. Listening to Crossing the Rubicon, I'm reminded of my long-ago defense of the Killers' Hot Fuss: put it on in a dark room stuffed with people and tell me how much that ""I'm not a solider"" line bothers you. Of course, there's nothing on here quite so enduring as Mr. Flowers and company's early seedlings, but the comparison's apt nonetheless. This is a decently crafted, moderately hooky, fairly vacuous power-pop album, and under the right light, you could do a whole lot worse. But I also can't help but think of their fellow Scandi-poppers Love Is All, who've made a pair of awfully similar, totally great party records of their own lately at a similar pace, infused with humor and pathos and Josephine Olausson's wooly howl. Both albums don't sound too bad in the dark, but I'll tell you which one I'll reach for in the daytime.","Swedish new-wave band long ago reached the point of no return.

KitsunÃ© Maison 7: The Lucky One,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f213d1975652138e29/1:1/w_160/bd10ac81.jpg,2009-06-12 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13206-kitsune-maison-7-the-lucky-one/,KitsunÃ©,"So KitsunÃ© has an iPhone app now. Some of the groups from previous KitsunÃ© Maison compilations have started playing live together under the tagline ""KitsunÃ© En Vrai!"" (""KitsunÃ© for Real!""). The influential French dance imprint has even taken to holding promotional contests: Your face could be on the next comp's crazy cover collage! As trend pieces about blogs give way to trend pieces about Twitter, the ragtag style of electronic music most memorably-- if least descriptively-- lumped together as ""blog house"" has become, almost literally, yesterday's news. And KitsunÃ©, after seven of these things, has long since lost its element of surprise. That's sort of what happens when you help launch the careers of Bloc Party, Hot Chip, Simian Mobile Disco, Klaxons, Crystal Castles, and basically every fashionably trashy electro-punk act that isn't Justice. This is good, of course, but ascendancy can breed complacency. One way to look at last year'sÂ KitsunÃ© Maison 6: The Melodic One is as a victim of the series' success, largely playing it safe with glossed-up but less-great takes on the kind of banging rock-meets-dance hybrids these guys have been championing since the first half of the decade. Even so, there were still left turns (a ballad!) and blogworthy newcomers (Heartsrevolution, Ted & Francis). KitsunÃ© Maison 7 is a slight but welcome improvement over its predecessor. Bright guitar pop and mellow psych-outs now go with the usual French Touch-ed electro-house thumps. The type of slow and spaced-out disco lately repopularized by LindstrÃ¸m, Studio, and others fields its biggest KitsunÃ© Maison representation yet. Sure, with 19 tracks (plus a 20-second ""encore"" break), the album still sometimes errs toward the generically danceable instead of the truly memorable. But the best cuts easily reconfirm the label's ear for promising talent. Not that you need KitsunÃ© to tell you Phoenix are fucking awesome, but a remix by L.A. duo Classixx gives Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix's ""Lisztomania"" a gorgeously pillowy synth-disco framework, sort of like Simian Mobile Disco's ""I Believe"" or Friendly Fires' ""Paris (Aeroplane Remix)"". Also graceful is Prins Thomas' ""Sneaky Edit"" of London folktronica singer/songwriter James Yuill's ""This Sweet Love"", with its feathery acoustic guitar and house beats suggesting a cosmic disco re-edit of JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez-- or Matthew Sweet. Northern Ireland's Two Door Cinema Club open the comp with breezy pop, like a bubblegum Phoenix with Vampire Weekend on chirruping lead guitar. To give you an idea how mellow this disc can be: L.A.'s Heartsrevolution, last seen making croaky basement electro-punk the Crystal Castles way, are back this time with a woozy music-box commencement lullaby (and a neat The Little Prince-inspired video). Other choice selections include more predictable KitsunÃ© jams. New York blog darlings the Golden Filter stick to their Glass Candy-glazed nu-disco on ""Favorite Things"", which happy-birthday-Mr.-Presidents its target demo's turn-ons: ""Paris, London, sweet girls, cute boys, vodka, whiskey, cameras, pictures.""

Jhelli Beam,Busdriver,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5095e6ef959693209e7/1:1/w_160/78bda2fa.jpg,2009-06-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13228-jhelli-beam/,Anti-,"I doubt there will be a record I hear this year that's topping the sheer word count of Jhelli Beam, and yet the line that feels the most revelatory comes courtesy of someone who isn't Busdriver. On ""Least Favorite Rapper"", guest Nocando spits, ""The suburban kids say I'm not street enough/ But compared to them, I'm street as fuck."" It's that combination of self-awareness, self-deprecation, and, ultimately, self-defense that's played a large role in defining the Busdriver Experience over nearly a decade of way-left-of-the-dial hip-hop. Though too bizarro for mainstream acceptance, it actually works in his favor; as much as Busdriver appeals to the technically obsessed purists, he might even hold as much appeal for people who'd otherwise avoid hip-hop completely. Still nothing's gonna stop Busdriver from critiquing just about everybody outside of the Project Blowed collective-- an aim that makesÂ Jhelli Beam feels at times less than laser-guided. ""Least Favorite Rapper"" initially sounds like it's got a serious case of the Paul Barmans-- check the blood-curdling opener: ""These sneaker geek MCs to me are so Brokeback/ So fuck sexy, in '09 I'm bringing broke back."" But the reason it actually ends up being funny (Nocando is ""vibing witcha like Michael Richards"" before letting off a Tommy-gun blast of the word that ended his career) lies in how it sounds like it's actually parodying indie rappers complaining about strawmen (""He sells more drugs than the FDA/ He's ready for war like FDR"") than making an actual critique of the mainstream rap scene. At least I hope that's what it is: These guys do realize the Next Great Hope (as of June 2009) of hip-hop played a wheelchair-bound high school kid on a Canadian sitcom, right? As always, Busdriver is about as technically impressive as an MC can get, the cultural vocabulary of DOOM funneled through Doseone's vocal dexterity (though as a singer, Bus is far more unhinged). Hey, I love both of those guys, but there's a reason you don't hear too many people thinking they should borrow from each other. I can think of a handful of times where I can hardly believe that this stuff can be listened to for enjoyment-- Bus plays cat and mouse with Mozart's ""Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major"" on lead single ""Me-Time"" with stunning agility, and while it's admittedly the kind of thing you'd like to see him pull of live, I can't so much vouch for him appropriating Carl the Groundskeeper's gopher song from ""Caddyshack"" (""Handfuls of Sky"") or ""This Old Man"" for a tribute to Project Blowed loyalty (""I've Always Known""). ""Art rap!"" he declares at the beginning of ""World Agape"", as if you couldn't tell from the erratic jazz-tom rolls that comprise its two and a half minutes. But it's tough to tell just how much Busdriver's in on the joke-- the very first words of Jhelli Beam are ""conscious rap failed us,"" and later on, he sneers ""underground rap happened 10 years ago"" before admitting that people in his position get ""no kudos for being a pseudo-commie"" despite functioning ""under the awning of [his] moral high ground.""Â Thanks to typically club-evasive but inventive beatmaking from long-time associates Nobody, Daedalus, and Nosaj Thing meshing wonderfully with Busdriver's torrential flow, Jhelli Beam somehow can be enjoyable just as an in-one-ear-out-the-other experience; you can enjoy the clap-happy cadence of ""Manchuria"" or ""Quebec And Back""'s goblin-like vocal effects completely worry free. But once you get yourself involved, there's no turning back-- you just brave the storm of proper nouns and pop culture detritus to the point where it's a Girl Talk-style game of ""oh, hey-- I recognize that!"" but not a Girl-Talk-style listen for, well, pleasure. The question then become whether you can maintain interest in how much effort Busdriver exerts to get across... god knows what. It takes a couple of pushes on the rewind button to cobble together how ""Dane Cook table reads"" and ""anal beads"" can constitute a rhyme, let alone ""bouillon cubes,"" ""oolong tea,"" and ""Moveon.org."" Why should I call him ""Scoliosis Jones""? Taken in context with just about everything else, it's another reference to Busdriver willing to let his freak flag fly, but since when was clarity such anathema? Particularly in a situation where the heads that Bus seeks out are equally into a rap classic that boasted, ""I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin'"" as they are into the ""spiced out Calvin Coolidge/ Loungin' with seven duelers"" classic. In the end, yes, Jhelli Beam manages to be a completely cerebral experience and at times overwhelming in a satisfactory way, but then again, you could say the same about ice cream headaches.","Technically impressive as always, Busdriver returns with another record that sounds likeÂ DOOM's cultural vocabulary funneled through Doseone's vocal dexterity.

The Mirror Explodes,The Warlocks,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43613d1975652138c6f/1:1/w_160/e0288aa4.jpg,2009-06-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13049-the-mirror-explodes/,Tee Pee,"Legalize it and so forth, but drug-takers gotta realize something: it is a supremely selfish act, taking drugs. Navel-gazing is one thing; taking a picture of said navel and posting it to your Tumblr with Blingees 'cuz it gave you a giggle, far different. Who knows what Los Angeles' Warlocks do with the black light on; all we have are their records, and The Mirror Explodes is the fifth proper. It may not be drug-induced, though it's certainly sticky with the resin of said creativity vehicle; this is a druggy album. The Velvet Underground, once and always the template for most drug-rock worth its salt, are still the Warlocks' godhead, along with the swampier, swirlier moments of their fellow drag-chasers Kevin Shields and the brothers Reid. I realize it's reductive to suggest Mirror sounds like Kev playing the ""Loomer"" riff over ""Black Angel's Death Song"", but it's only reductive as that would be more awesome than this record turns out to be. Still, it's an equation they (and, to an even dronier extent, the Black Angels) have made a career of; they did, after all, have a tune called ""Song for Nico"" on their debut, and here we are eight years later. Ironically, ""Song for Nico"" sounds like Big Star compared to Mirror, a record that picks a mood-- dark-- and sticks with it. The earlier Warlocks records played with space and tempo in a way Mirror casts aside in favor of front-to-back stoney, reverby sludge. Oddly enough, I'm reminded of a recent quote I read attributed to somebody or other from recently rejuvenated big beaters the Prodigy, suggesting that years 'round the bong had left him, however temporarily, with ""no personality."" I can't help but wonder whether that's the culprit for why Mirror feels so drab and tuneless, an album whose heavy lids bespeak a fairly narrow vision. It's tough to get a hold on this record, since it's somewhat averse to melody or much shading beyond ""gray and slightly deeper gray."" A few tunes sway where others swarm, but they're all bathed in such fuzz it's a drag to differentiate. There are moments-- like the guitar flutter in the set's rockiest rocker, ""Frequency Meltdown"", or the pull of the Jesus and Mary Chainsaw around ""Slowly Disappearing""-- that pop out a bit, but the album does precious little to distinguish between tracks, let alone between itself and the work of other bands. Certainly the Warlocks at their most monochromatic, whereas in the past it seemed as though they couldn't help but bring a little light in. If they were going for ""bummed out in a basement"", well, they got it, but as in real life, that tends to be interesting only to those who made the trek down the stairs themselves. This is where the selfishness thing comes in; Mirror never goes far out enough to be ""self-indulgent"" per se, but it does seem wrapped up in its own little bubble, and penetrating that is actually something of a chore. There's little dynamism in the arrangements, nothing particularly revelatory about the mostly-mumbled lyrics, and certainly nothing original about adding a fresh coat of black paint to the house that John Cale built. It'd be one thing if prolonged exposure to the fuzz resulted in a better understanding of these songs, but they're just as bleary on the first listen as the tenth, and they wind up sounding like somebody else's bad time, but not really one you'll want to call your own. Druggy records are never all that good when they don't convey anything about the experience other than the blur. That's not to say you couldn't get swept up in The Mirror Explodes' churn under the right influence, but it's not something to inspire the formation of many new memories.","L.A. psychedelic revivalists have taken a darker and druggier turn on their latest, an album whose heavy lids bespeak a narrow vision.

Miike Snow,Miike Snow,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c8c0084474cd0c057e/1:1/w_160/4890a68f.jpg,2009-06-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13189-miike-snow/,Downtown,"Even the most dependable producers tend to stumble when they step out from behind the curtain. Timbaland's Shock Value sold more than a milli, nothing to sneeze Creatine at, but its distillation of the hip-hop heavyweight's sci-fi primitivism still sounds more like a victory lap than an actual victory. Swizz Beatz had at least one solid artist album in him, but he's no rapper, as the wait for a follow-up underscores. And N.E.R.D.? Um, you've heard those guys' other stuff, right? Pop's biggest producer-to-artist success stories, such as Kanye West, have become exceptions thanks in part to their outsize personalities. That's where Miike Snow start to fall short. And not just because they briefly cloaked themselves in the whole ""ooh we're anonymous, who could we be?"" promotional trend that's been sweeping the blogs. True, you expect good things from Swedish producers Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, who as Bloodshy & Avant produced Britney Spear's indie-kid-converting 2004 single ""Toxic"", among other tracks for the likes of Spears, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Rachel Stevens, and Sugababes. But Scandinavia's recent indie-pop leadership notwithstanding, ""Swedish producers"" doesn't exactly scream ""would be interesting to hear by themselves at album-length."" Enter Downtown Recordings production regular Andrew Wyatt, of anthemic New York electro-rockers Fires of Rome (and previously of Black Beetle, with Jeff Buckley cohorts Joan Wasser and Michael Tighe). Miike Snow is about as exciting as all those biographical details would indicate. The debut album by these producers-turned-trio comes after blog-bait remixes galore, including a nice enough Postal Service-ish Vampire Weekend makeover, but there's little of those fine young Columbians' infectious exuberance here. Biggest surprise? Miike Snow largely trade in brash pop immediacy for low-key, piano-laden melancholy. Decent bummer of a first single ""Burial"", with its fluttery synths, tricky rhythms, and a couple of those vaguely exotic yelps currently de riguer in commercials for lime-flavored beer*,* is sort of like crying your eyes out to Phil Collins on a beach. Also like that, it's a bit nonsensical: ""This empathy is overrated/ Like a snapshot when you've lost the game."" Stop overrating those snapshots, people! The sunny West Coast harmonies of ""Faker"" and the oceanic calmness of ""Sans Soleil"" similarly suffice without quite standing out. Miike Snow are better when they're more starlet-ready, though even then they could use an actual starlet. The thickly textured buzz-strut of ""Plastic Jungle"" is pretty close to Britney's ""Womanizer"", but instead of femme-bot purrs there's a whispery guy who wants to ""get slain."" Whether in the kiddie-pop lilt of opener ""Animal"", the Field-minding hypnotism of ""In Search Of"", or the glimmering electro-house thump of ""Silvia"" and the yearning ""A Horse Is Not a Home"" (no, not even in this real-estate market), the disc is rarely less than professional-grade. Faint praise, sigh. So Miike Snow aren't half as potentially infuriating as a Kanye or a Timbaland, but they aren't half as lovable, either. More promisingly, the album's ""Black & Blue"" splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole. The best track, the one with the Dirty Projectors-like flickering guitars, perfect for summer driving mixes: ""Song for No One"". Hello, is it me you're looking for?","Bloodshy & Avant, the Swedish production team behind Britney's ""Toxic"" and remixes for bands like Vampire Weekend, step out from behind the board.

All Reflections Drained,Xasthur,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4615e6ef9596932086c/1:1/w_160/15de9cb9.jpg,2009-06-11 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13085-all-reflections-drained/,Hydra Head,"The publicity for Scott Conner's new album as Xasthur shows him, probably for the first time, without black-metal corpse paint. He looks like any other regular Joe trying to look serious while wearing a hood. He isn't, though. Over the course of many albums and even more splits and EPs, Xasthur has become perhaps the biggest name in American black metal. Ironically, a cult of personality has sprung up around him because he has shunned the spotlight. He rarely gives interviews, withheld printed lyrics from his last album, and until now, has appeared only in grainy photos with face obscured by makeup. His unveiling might suggest some insight into the personality behind his sound. Instead, it brings greater obfuscation, as his music has become even more gnarled and disturbed. In a world where ""metal"" isn't a dirty word, Conner could be hailed as some kind of composer genius. He's not a composer in the traditional sense; in fact, structural composition is his greatest weakness.Â Xasthur tracks tend to be long and droning and don't go anywhere. However, they reside in a unique place. Conner has taken the ""suicidal black metal"" pioneered by the likes of Shining and Silencer (who themselves were inspired by Burzum) into territories that strain metal's boundaries. Metal usually is big and strong. Xasthur is born of weakness, with tinny tones and strangled shrieks off in the distance. Songs don't involve riffs so much as miasmas of guitar. The gestures are basic-- slow jangles, mostly-- but they involve lots of ""wrong"" notes and indeterminate tonalities. Add broken church-organ keyboards and hyper-dramatic song titles (""Malice Hidden in Surrealism"", ""Funerals Drenched in Apathy""), and the results are crackpot, yet harmonically rich. Scoring Xasthur for string ensembles would befit horror movies. Conner has perhaps realized this, as All Reflections Drained is hardly metal. Its mood is heavy, and it houses some distorted guitars. But keyboards and textures are more prevalent than ever; this record could be mistaken for Kronos Quartet on a binge of downers. Previous record Defective Epitaph was Xasthur's first with acoustic drums. Its songs weren't as endless as before, probably because Conner discovered that playing real drums was more troublesome than letting electronic ones do the work. His wobbly playing gave the record a crackly, crepitant quality.Â All Reflections Drained continues likewise, and feels even more ""foldable,"" due to strange editing techniques. Songs often morph mid-stream into unrelated grooves. At their best, they echo the Charles Ives effect of multiple ensembles playing against each other. At their worst, they feel like sketches pasted together haphazardly. Conner dislikes doing vocals, and thus this record is mostly instrumental. Pianos, dime store guitars, timpanis, and strings (real or synth, it doesn't really matter) swirl together in dirty, disharmonic soups. It's a mess-- sometimes frustrating, sometimes interesting, and always utterly depressing.","Perhaps the biggest name in American black metal, Xashtur returns, revealing his long-cloaked identity but maintaining the mystery in his music.

Boys,Cortney Tidwell,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b713d1975652138d92/1:1/w_160/c7100d07.jpg,2009-06-11 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13157-boys/,City Slang,"Considering we're roughly 15 years removed from the commercial and critical peaks of BjÃ¶rk, Tori Amos, and PJ Harvey, it shouldn't be a surprise that a spate of female artists who evoke those icons has cropped up on the indie-rock radar recently. Not only were the formative years of St. Vincent, Bat for Lashes, and Lavender Diamond spent in a milieu in which such bracing women were topping critic's polls and storming Billboard charts, that same climate also nurtured so many thousands of fans who now make up a sizable chunk of indie's customer base. So it makes sense that so many listeners would be eager to herald up-and-coming young women who remind them of their middle-school heroines. Cortney Tidwell definitely belongs on this list of recent female insurgents. Though her background sets her apart from the bigger names from the earlier era, Tidwell draws from them to an even greater degree than her contemporaries do, in addition to incorporating femme-heavy trip-hop, dream-pop, and shoegaze sources. Tidwell's family actually has deep roots in country music, her mother and grandfather having performed on the Grand Ole Opry, while her father continues to thrive as a recording engineer in Nashville. When you throw in the biographical tidbit that she was a Joy Division acolyte as a youth, I guess it's not difficult to surmise how the ""country goth"" tag got slapped on Tidwell's music at the outset of her career. But despite a very occasional tendency to let her voice loom large and haunting like a spectral Patsy Cline, Tidwell's M.O. is miles removed from Music Row. She'd much rather adopt a girlish tone when singing, and dress up her compositions with dreamy keyboards, arty atmospherics, and occasional noise touches. At this point, after Ewan Pearson's terrific 2007 reworking of her ""Don't Let the Stars Keep Us Tangled Up"", Tidwell's biggest worry should be making sure she doesn't end up stuck in the Goldfrapp/Sia Furler career trap of being primarily reckoned as remix fodder. Her sophomore effort, Boys, begins with a consummate red herring in the form of ""Solid State"", a smoky, noir-ish tease that perfectly fulfills the parameters of ""country goth,"" and which Tidwell of course spends the remainder of the album distancing herself from as much as possible (only ""Being Crosby"", a lovely duet with Jim James full of gently tugging acoustic guitars and faraway banjo, signifies ""country"" much at all). Tidwell gives immediate notice that she won't be catering to the Paste set anytime soon with the album's second track, ""Watusii"", a clanging, dissonant art-pop banger that offers Boys' first proof of significant BjÃ¶rk-ish predilections. ""Son & Moon"" is this album's blatant Vespertine bite (joining ""I Do Not Notice"" from her debut), while ""Oslo"" reveals Tidwell learned a thing or two from Radiohead as well (namely, fromÂ OK Computerâs guitars and In Rainbows' bass). The charging ""So We Sing"" is refreshingly in-your-face and offers one of the album's most immediate refrains, but it gives way to a back half that starts bleeding into one slow, prettily atmospheric wash. It's a dreamy, wallpaper-ish rut that ""Palace"" and ""Oh, Suicide"" can't rise above, though ""Oh, China"" and ""17 Horses"" do distinguish themselves modestly thanks to the former's title-evoking rhythmic patterns and the latter's slightly pace-changing approximation of PJ Harvey. I can understand Tidwell not achieving Bat For Lashes-like levels of success and acclaim, considering Natasha Khan's work is far more emotionally dynamic and immediately pleasurable. However, Tidwell does at least deserve to be reckoned as St. Vincent's peer-- her music may not be as brightly likable as Annie Clark's, but Tidwell is a more compelling vocalist and more stylistically omnivorous to boot. She may occasionally allow artiness to get in the way of enjoyableness on Boys, but Tidwell otherwise proves herself a worthy inheritor to the alt-rock personality queens of the 1990s.","On her promising second album, this Nashville-based singer-songwriter looks to 1990s art-rock with an electronic tinge for inspiration.

The Bachelor,Patrick Wolf,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44dc0084474cd0c0470/1:1/w_160/020bb7db.jpg,2009-06-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13067-the-bachelor/,Bloody ChamberNYLON,"Regardless of his mythmaking and tireless efforts to project an otherworldly persona, Patrick Wolf still tends to write what he knows. One of the first of many bold proclamations on The Bachelor goes ""in these hard times, we'll work harder,"" and whether you see him as an impish genius or a guy who'd be better off without an internet connection, you can't fault his commitment to craft-- all three of his previous records were meticulously imagined; all three sounded like the work of one man but rarely sounded like each other. The Bachelor ups the ambition ante even higher, but it's just as as notable for displaying Wolf at his most interdependent, fitting in guest shots from Alec Empire and Tilda Swinton. Wolf's changes have been gradual: After the origin story of Lycanthropy, 2005's Wind in the Wires longed for pastoral escape but sounded like it was recorded in a remote hidey hole, all of which made the gushing, Cure-styled romance of The Magic Position a bona fide breakthrough. After that record's major keys and genuine human connections, The Bachelor isn't a hangover album so much as one on which Wolf picks up the morning paper and, without really breaching any specific topic, realizes that we're all in this world of shit together. The Bachelor was initially conceived as a politically minded double-album entitled Battle, but Wolf's loves and depressions got the better of the initial plan-- either that, or he just realized that a politically minded double-album is a phenomenally bad idea. Nonetheless, the opening salvo of ""Hard Times"" and ""Oblivion"" are remnants of the aggressiveness Wolf set out for, the former recalling ""The Libertine"" in how it's prodded by a serrated, hooky string riff and the latter barreling forth with Wolf's most footloose electro-rhythms. Most of The Bachelor's strengths sound borne out of arrangements rather than visceral or melodic thrills. For better or worse, that's likely been preventing any sort of real crossover for Wolf despite his acclaim-- while ""Blackdown"" culminates with a lovely Celtic hoedown, it takes about four minutes of tear-stained ivory tinkling to get there, and ""The Sun Is Often Out"" follows up with diminishing returns, struggling for a tune until a coda of choirboy chanting tries to make the preceding events sound like they were building towards something cathartic. Even with all the momentum-sapping balladry, The Bachelor could still be considered Wolf's most physical album. Musical vigor backing worldly attempts at lyricism, however, is better left to Green Day (wait, no, that's not right)-- and here Wolf too often overstates things in search of some sort of populist truth. More worrying is that, despite all of the instrumental bric-a-brac dotting The Bachelor, Wolf leans on a choral mass during all the big moments-- a choir hopes for revolution towards the end of ""Hard Times"", exalts the listener to ""rise up"" during the coda of the otherwise understated ""Damaris"", repeats the title of the seriously Bono-fide arena raiser ""Who Will?"", and that's covering about half of it. Wolf's always had an unsteady hand at hard rock, going down the supermassive black hole of fight music on ""Battle"" is at least a bizarre novelty that's kinda funny. As far as other bizarre novelties, unsurprisingly, ""Tilda Swinton as 'The Voice of Hope'"" is as ridiculous to hear as it is to type, triggering unfortunate flashbacks to horribly dated Age of Virtual Reality relics like Billy Idol's Cyberpunk and Kirstie Alley styling on the interludes to Prince's Symbol. Strangely enough, Wolf's unclassifiable work to this point has managed to place him in a god-honest class of similarly minded Kate Bush acolytes-- but like St. Vincent and Bat For Lashes, there's the problem where stressing one's inner control freak can come at the expense of other freakiness. Or at least it can make any semblance of eccentricity feel micromanaged and forced, and Wolf lacks the former's humor or the latter's sultry songcraft to counterbalance it. Which admittedly sucks, because The Bachelor is still admirable in so many theoretical ways-- it's recorded almost flawlessly, and it appeals to the idea that an album is supposed to be an album of considered choices. Which is great, except that for all of the talk of Wolf being a chameleonic drama queen, oddball, or genius, The Bachelor most damningly lacks the charm attendant with any of those character descriptions, continuing Wolf's ability to please one's inner music critic, but too often ignoring any sort of pleasure principle.","One of the decade's true originals followsÂ The Magic Position with his most populist record to date.

They've probably listened to their fair share of Replacements records and peak-period punk (a more ragged Radio Birdman comes to mind), and judging from Lose Your Illusion, Too, their third album, they've assimilated those things plenty well enough to do it themselves, and do it well. Hiding behind that creepy/confusing, vaguely provocative album cover is something altogether easier to digest. Leading the charge is guitarist/vocalist Kevin Richard, whose gritty, strangled delivery is the automatic focal point, reinforced by his mates shouting in tandem behind him. This gives the music a visceral kick that the riffs and rhythms can't usually muster by themselves, but it also compromises some of the band's melodic ambitions-- his sandpaper rasp sometimes simply fails to define the notes. Lose Your Illusion isn't significantly different from the band's first two albums, but it does have a bit more pop in the songwriting, and inevitably that sharpest hooks are the ones where the backing vocals ride to the rescue, as they do on every line ofÂ ""Helpful"",Â a song whose clipped gait gives it a Clash-y feel. ""Kinda Babes""Â is a good example of a song whose pop appeal is compromised by the constantly strained lead vocals-- the lighter arrangement, with just a bit of tambourine for percussion and cleanly strummed guitar, gets into a nice call-and-response between the backing vocals and the lead, but where the backing vocals hint at a fluid phrase, it never comes, and instead a bit of slide guitar mixed way back comes in to hint even further.Â ""Exquisite Corpse"",Â an attempt at a ballad, drips with catharsis but isn't half as memorable as it should be. The gravel is a lot more apt on amped-up stomper ""Chopper"",Â which cycles through ferocious Stooges riffs with wicked authority.Â ""Never Lived By Myself""Â makes good use of humor in the call-and-response, with drummer Seth Bohn rhetorically asking, ""Where did all my money go? I don't know. I probably spent it all on smokes,""Â and getting an unexpected answer from the band, which replies,Â ""Yes, probably."" They save the hardest punch for last, wrapping the album up withÂ ""(Us And) All Our Friends Are So Messed Up"",Â a song that morphs into a massive barroom shout-along in its final third that I imagine would be thrilling in a club with the crowd joining in. In fact, most of the album seems as though it would translate better on stage, where the sweat and volume of a club could really send it all home. As it stands, Lose Your Illusion, Too makes a good racket but falls a little short of making its songs stick.","Taking cues from the Replacements and peak-period punk, Chicago'sÂ Mannequin Men take decades-old rock tropes and pull them off.

My Electric Family,Bachelorette,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5085e6ef959693209e4/1:1/w_160/81832eeb.jpg,2009-06-10 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13227-my-electric-family/,Drag City,"However opaque some of her ideas, Annabel Alpers is transparent when it comes to album titles. The New Zealander's last release as Bachelorette, 2008's Isolation Loops, was indeed a solo affair that, with its crackerjack melodies and lush, layered self-harmonies, made as much gorgeous electro-pop noise as any one-person project, but also erred on the side of solipsism. On that record, Alpers probed evergreen themes of loneliness and alienation via technology, peeling off lyrical barbs about vacant modern relationships (memorably in ""Duet Minus One"", ""I went to his house/ He offered me food/ I only accepted tea/ Because it's gluten-free"") in her aloof, robotic lisp. Her new LP, My Electric Family, attempts to break the self-referential loop, opening up emotionally and expanding Bachelorette's circle to include some unexpected sounds and-- perhaps more important symbolically than in fact-- other musicians. Opener ""Instructions for Insomniacs"" signals this shift immediately with rhythmic, repetitive guitar strumming, Alpers' bare voice, and the unlikely strains of pedal steel. The song soon dusts itself off and climbs on the backs of a looped electronic flute figure and Alpers' multi-tracked ahs to a glorious crescendo. The new players' rootsy influences provide welcome texture to the project's typically synthetic mixes, but ""Insomniacs""' slow build and kaleidoscopic explosion is already something of a Bachelorette trademark. Alpers repeats the trick on the otherwise dour, sample-cobbled track two, ""The National Grid"", and later by layering keyboard lines, percussion, and finally boisterous horns, on ""Dream Sequence"". ""Her Rotating Head"" is one of several songs on the record that sweats with disco fever, nostalgic, disembodied handclaps and squiggly-line analog synths included. With her cool and kittenish alto, Alpers is a credible indie-dance diva and the song's melody is memorable enough, but what makes ""Head"" special is its final minute's critical mass of layered vocals glinting and somersaulting through space. She may fear becoming a machine, but when Alpers folds herself into the electronic process, the results are delicious, even ecstatic. Alpers is so adept at intricate bedroom pop that I sort of wish she'd leave it at that, because she tends to undermine Bachelorette's power with incoherent and insincerely applied themes. My Electric Family is less isolationist than its predecessor, seeming to concede the possibility of human relationships and providing a glimpse into Alpers' inner life. ""Where to Begin"", for example, adeptly captures the yearning pathos of people with mostly online lives (""On the computer/ Observing strangers/ Ignoring those around you""). But she starts to muddy the waters when she dabbles in dystopia. ""Technology Boy"" asserts to dorky bleeps n' bloops that the titular character ""attempts to live his life as a machine/ But then his humanness experiences utilitarian resentment."" Sound and fury, meet nothing. ""Mercurial Man"" and ""Her Rotating Head"" also spit up silly logic-defiers and broadcast sentiments that seem ripped from a retro-futurist style manual. Retro-futurism's a durable and persistent pop culture trope, currently burning up the design world on every front from mid-century modern-inspired furniture to steampunk fashion. But unmoored from original context and free-floating in the past's imaginary future, it's style, not substance. There's absolutely nothing wrong with pop music that just wants to sound sleek and sexy and goad you into singing in the shower or dancing deliriously (and some would argue that's all pop should aspire to). Bachelorette, however, seems to harbor loftier ambitions. But although Alpers has found a winning sound, she's still scrambling to gather her notes and draft a theme she can deliver with conviction.","Opening up emotionally and embracing new sounds and other musicians,Â Annabel Alpers' former one-woman project grows musically as well on her second LP.

Battle For the Sun,Placebo,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bdc0084474cd0c0565/1:1/w_160/6961fcb9.jpg,2009-06-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13162-battle-for-the-sun/,Vagrant,"For better or worse, Battle For the Sun is further proof that when you're listening to Placebo album, you definitely know it's Placebo. That in and of itself is something of an accomplishment considering the turnover that preceded it: longtime drummer Stephen Hewitt (whose most notable contribution to the group was letting a drum machine fill in on ""Pure Morning"") was replaced by a twentysomething refugee from a California pop-punk group, the band signed with Vagrant, and the group hired nu-metal maven David Bottrill (Tool, Staind, Godsmack) to produce the record. As you could guess from all of that, Battle For the Sun is meant as a rejuvenation of the Placebo brand-- the sort of thing where they're gonna ""get back to basics"" and just crank out the no-frills rock action. In other words, they've jettisoned just about anything that ever made them perversely enjoyable. It's a fight they just can't win-- even during their better days, Placebo's appeal lay entirely in a sense that Brian Molko's routine was somehow subversive, along with the occasional blast of industrial rhythms and abrasive guitar noise. Now it's all major keys and keyboard fills and ""yes we can"" attitude like they have the arms to box with the gods in Muse. At least at the outset, Molko allows somewhat newer ideas to infiltrate otherwise airtight strictures of his songcraft. Most of them give the hint that he owns a copy of Bloc Party's Silent Alarm: the hand-clappy breakdown on the unfortunately titled and composed ""Kitty Litter"", ""Ashtray Heart"" and its massed pub-chanting (and if you've gotten this far, you might know Ashtray Heart was the band's original name). But whatever tweaks got thrown in are all at the mercy of Bottrill's iron fist, and damn if the first word that comes to mind is ""merciless."" Though he appears to be using at least three strings on his guitar this time out, Molko's instrument is as processed, smooth, and tasteless as a pimento loaf, along with strings and horn blasts that are so canned they might as well be orchestra hit presets. The Billy Corgan-style metaphysics of ""The Never-Ending Why"" feel like they exist solely to hammer home how little bands of Placebo's ilk have learned about the loudness wars since the horrifyingly recorded MACHINA. But hell, I'm surprised as you are that I haven't brought up the lyrics yet. You probably know where this is going, but at least during Placebo's earlier work, Molko had something of a juvenile charm when he was beating Wavves to the weed/goth girls game by a decade. Somehow they've gotten worse. Though ""For What It's Worth"" has the record's fiercest hook, after what could pass for incidental ""Tetris"" music, the band stops midway for Molko to lament, ""No one cares when you're out in the streets/ Picking up the pieces to make ends meet/ No one cares when you're out in the gutter/ Got no friends ain't got no lover,"" before having the nerve to repeat it for the rest of the song. Whether he's rehashing ""Commercial For Levi""'s laughable attempt at PSA moralizing (""Julien"") or leading dead-horse clichÃ©s to the glue factory (""Devil in the Details"", ""Breathe Underwater""), Molko's rhymes somehow manage to be completely predictable and yet somehow totally unbelievable: the watery guitar figures that open ""Come Undone"" suggest a possible Duran Duran cover, but instead it's Battle for the Sun's stab at resonance-- ""You don't know how you're coming across/ Acting like you don't give a toss/ Walking around like you're on some kind of cross/ And it's a shame on you the irony's lost."" Oh, word? If the fact that I'm in my late twenties and still reviewing Placebo records doesn't make it totally obvious, I'll just come out and say it-- back in 1998, I thought Without You I'm Nothing was the absolute shit. Though it hit during the salad days of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", you could argue that the popularity of the Twilight series has made that album's combination of amateur sexual deviance and gender ambiguity somewhat timely. As such, Placebo seem to be sustaining their musical careers the same way Dazed and Confused's Wooderson sustained his social career: ""That's what I love about these Placebo fans, man. I get older, they stay the same age.""","With a new ex-pop-punk drummer, a new label (Vagrant), and the help of a dude who produced Godsmack, this is meant to beÂ a rejuvenation of the Placebo brand.

Mingus Ah Um: Legacy Edition,Charles Mingus,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4beb1335d7bf1698a29/1:1/w_160/6ed052b8.jpg,2009-06-10 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13163-mingus-ah-um/,Legacy,"Chuckle a pitying chuckle over Allaboutjazz.com's guide ""1959: The Most Creative Year in Jazz."" Miles Davis's Kind of Blue: ""the quintessential jazz album""; Coltrane's Giant Steps: ""a major landmark in jazz history""; Brubeck's ""Take Five"": ""one of the most popular tunes in jazz""; Ornette Coleman's The Shape of Jazz to Come: ""the essential free jazz album."" Mingus Ah Um? ""Essential to Mingus fans and jazz aficionados"" (emphasis mine). Poor big-bellied, cigar-loving, temperamental, insecure, misogynistic Charles Mingus. While routinely placed on best-of-genre lists and talked about as one of the preeminent bassists and bandleaders in jazz, his best albums never clump comfortably with anyone else's, or with any particular subset of casual jazz listeners. They're too spirited for cocktail hour, too rough and moody for listeners who revel in crafstmanship, and not radical enough for daredevils. Then again, Mingus' music never seemed comfortable outside its own world, either. At the dawn of both modal and free jazz, he kept solos short and music composed (even if, as with 1959's Atlantic recording Blues and Roots, the players didn't see the charts before the studio date). In an era where big bands were left behind for small combos or reimagined entirely (as with, say, John Coltrane's late albums), Mingus was a Duke Ellington acolyte who approached his pieces with the formality of an orchestral composer. ""Better Git It in Your Soul""-- if Mingus had his own sound, Mingus Ah Um's opener was it: a warm, striding, Sunday-morning tune carried on moaning horns; a friendly, convivial atmosphere punctuated by hollers Mingus didn't bother suppressing in the studio. Mingus, born to a black father and Chinese-American mother who allowed only church music in the house, embraced blues and gospel in the complex way one embraces a friend they've fallen out of touch with, or their hometown-- cautiously; with a burdened and deep-buried love. The song never struck me as primitive or rootsy, but a comic-book version of primitive, rootsy music-- a form reduced to its most basic shapes and traits; a form almost abstracted. The album rolls from there. And while ""Better Git"" is as good a definition of Mingus there is, the album is remarkably diverse: Set pieces like ""Fables of Faubus"" or ""Jelly Roll"" (which are a jazz analog to the Beatles's warped, fruity variations on early British pop, like ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"") play alongside factory-pressed bop- and swing-style songs like ""Boogie Stop Shuffle"" and the mournful, reverent balladry of ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"". Harmonies invoke modern classical music almost as often as blues, and his chosen instrumentalists spend as much effort adding color to the ensemble as personality to their brief solos. Regarding the product at hand: a 2xCD 50th anniversary ""Legacy Edition"" with a list price of $25. The remaster is the same one performed by Mark Wilder in the late 1990s and still in print. Along with a couple of alternate takes, the second disc contains Mingus Dynasty, an uneven and far less interesting album recorded later in 1959 and issued early in 1960. The liner notes are slim and strangely conceived (do I need to read that a song on this album is a ""grand slam home run"" even though I clearly have already purchased it?). The bonus material on the second disc, in PDF format, should've been in the booklet if they're charging $25 for a package that probably didn't demand a lot of work to re-release. That's that. I'm sure I'm not versed enough in jazz to assess what it is that makes Mingus Mingus, but listening to Ah Um again-- an album I plucked from my dad's collection at age 15-- I remember sitting in my family's basement thinking that I had no idea jazz could be funny. (I hadn't yet heard Thelonious Monk.) I thought jazz was all elegance and poise. I remember reading transcriptions of Charlie Parker solos and wondering if my intellectual awe would translate to a real, visceral love of the music. It didn't-- I felt detached. Mingus was slurring and gestural. His compositions that looked prim on paper sounded rusted and sun-bleached in performance. The fiery ones sounded a little tight-assed and penned-in-- you could almost hear the band bucking with discomfort at the form they found themselves playing in. The music had character; it beamed. Still does.","A key album from the great bassist/composer/bandleader's canon is given an expanded 2xCD reissue that includes the complete album Mingus Dynasty.

The Ecstatic,Mos Def,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bc9d034d5c69bf3134/1:1/w_160/47a677c2.jpg,2009-06-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13161-the-ecstatic/,Downtown,"People looking for offhanded symbolism can feel free to try tracking Mos Def's career trajectory as an MC through his album covers. Iconic solo debut Black on Both Sides: a stark, immediately-striking photo portrait that renders the attribution of his name unnecessary. Aggro experimental follow-up The New Danger: that same face now obscured by a stick-up man's mask, his bright red, bloody-looking index fingertip pointing to his own head on some Taxi Driver shit. Contractual obligation mishap True Magic: no actual album art whatsoever, with a blank-looking Mos staring into space off the surface of the disc itself. And now The Ecstatic, which depicts not Mos Def himself but a red-tinted shot from Charles Burnett's classic 1977 film Killer of Sheep. You might go so far as to say this indicates that the best way for Mos Def to reassert what he really means as an artist would be to take his as-seen-in-Hollywood face out of the equation entirely, replacing it with a shot from an entirely different strain of independent, neorealist cinema that more clearly gets at what he represents as a lyricist. Maybe it's a stretch, but what the hell. And while Burnett's Watts isn't quite the same place as Mos Def's Bed-Stuy, it does exist as one of many geographical reference points in The Ecstatic's international style. This is Mos Def's small-globe statement, an album that comfortably jumps stylistically across continents on a hip-hop goodwill-ambassador tour, prefaced by a statement from Malcolm X during his 1964 appearance at Oxford: ""I, for one, will join in with anyone, I don't care what color you are, as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth."" It's a high-minded intro for an album that most people will hear first and foremost as the comeback bid of a rapper-turned-actor, but it also serves as an important indication that Mos actually gives a shit here, and that he has a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world. It starts with the production, which originates from assorted French touch cats (Mr. Flash) and Stones Throw siblings (Oh No; Madlib) and the producer from True Magic whoÂ actually contributed a couple decentish beats (Preservation). Oh No usefully repurposes some of the Turkish psych from his album Dr. No's Oxperiment, particularly the massive Selda-sampling acid-rock monster ""Heavy"" for lead track ""Supermagic"". Madlib contributes a couple tracks from his Beat Konducta in India series, diverting in their original form but done real justice by Mos' rhythm-sparring flow (and, in the case of ""Auditorium"", Slick Rick's). Ed Banger alum Mr. Flash covers the Caribbean (""Worker's Comp""), the Middle East (""Embassy""), and neon Euro-American club-kid slickness (""Life in Marvelous Times""). And Mos' own co-production touches in conjunction with Preservation's beats drive it all home: ""Quiet Dog"" opens with a defiant Fela Kuti soundbite, ""Casa Bey"" is built off Banda Black Rio's samba-funk number ""Casa Forte"", and Mos spends the entirety of ""No Hay Nada Mas"" rapping and singing in Spanish. There's a good chance you've heard some of this before-- aside from the aforementioned Oh No and Madlib contributions, ""Life in Marvelous Times"" recycles Mr. Flash's beat for ""Champions"", his collaboration with French rappers TTC-- but it's not a stale familiarity, at least in the context of The Ecstatic's ambitious B-boy diaspora. But it wouldn't mean shit if it felt like the itinerary of a jet-set movie star showing everyone his vacation slides. Fortunately, the good thing about Mos Def not having brought his A Game in a while is that, like many rappers whose reputations have slipped, he was due for a something-to-prove moment. The Ecstatic has a bunch of those, smuggled inside the usual big-up Brooklyn and hip-hop preservationist lyricism and welded-to-the-beat flow that made him shine in '99, and his better turns of phrase have a way of sneaking up on you and smacking you in the back of the head. ""Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren/ I swing 'round, wring out and bring down the tyrant/ Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided,"" he proclaims on ""Auditorium"" with the kind of delivery that makes the complex and convoluted sound natural. His anti-wack-MC diatribes on ""Quiet Dog"", the gunfight-love narrative of ""Pistola"" and the tone of sardonic but sincere Afrocentrism on ""Revelations"" reveal the versatility he still maintains in his repertoire. And even when he's just rattling off ego-trip riffs, the way he locks into a beat is scary; it's kind of hard to notice or care that he mostly keeps repeating the same Mary Poppins-derived hook on ""Supermagic"" when every syllable is like another percussion instrument boosting that head-nod factor by ten. There are still some moments of weird, dope-hazy fuck-around on Mos' part, and while they don't really distract to the point where they test your patience, the frequent times when he drops into quasi-aimless sing-song vamping-- or straight-up attempted singing-- give The Ecstatic the feeling of a weeded-out jam session that didn't always go entirely according to plan and somehow fell together anyways. Still, it's the kind of fucking around that's clearly coming from a dude who sounds liberated, and a lot of it-- like the outro in ""Pistola"" where he interpolates the Intruders' ""Cowboys to Girls"" over some Madlib-provided vibes and King Tubby cookie-sheet-smacking percussion, or the casually amped don't stop the rock/can't keep me down declarations of closing track ""Casa Bey""-- is too damn joyous to feel over-indulgent. Even absurd stuff like the Spanish track and his cod-reggae delivery on ""Workers Comp"" (try not to crack up the first time you hear the way he sings ""fie-yerd"" in the chorus) are more eccentric than bad. And anyone who wants to complain about those, well, go enjoy ""History"" instead: It's a Black Star reunion over a Dilla beat. Looks like we finally got the Mos Def we were waiting for.","Rapper's first solo album in almost three years is a small-globe statement that jumps stylistically across continents on a hip-hop goodwill-ambassador tour.

Clangour,Sin Fang Bous,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3709d034d5c69bf2e0e/1:1/w_160/f8f40df9.jpg,2009-06-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12889-clangour/,Morr,"Sin Fang Bous is the one-man project of Sindri MÃ¡r SigfÃºsson, the Icelander whose last one-man project, Seabear, swelled into a septet. But, just like his work with the old band, sweetness-with-bite wouldn't be the worst way to describe Clangour, SigfÃºsson's debut under his new name. Sure enough, the soothing sensibility of Seabear-- indie-rocking but peaceful, even a bit twee-- lives on in Sin Fang Bous. But here it gains teeth, so to speak. Leaving behind the predictable comforts of his group work, SigfÃºsson suffuses his new project with little anxieties and mysteries that have the power to surprise. If you watch the video for ""Advent in Ives Garden"", a playfully literal translation of the lyrics, each verse given clumsily animated life, you'll find that its harlequin color, surreal sights, and crooked lines mimic the naive experimentalism of outsider art. Beyond this one song, the video's aesthetic captures the twisted-fairytale aura and the alluring looseness, of both concept and composition, that marks the entire record. You can find these elements on ""Catch the Light"" and ""Clangour and Flutes"", two shabbily uptempo numbers that lean heavily on a 4/4 thump; both go for an acoustic, even rural simplicity with their piano arpeggios, or shimmering tambourines, or solitary flute. That steady digital pulse adds a surprising dimension to the otherwise analog activity in the foreground: on ""We Belong"", it offers an emotional anchor for the soaring Paw Tracks-style flights of fancy that isn't there on, for one, the skittering and thoroughly processed ""A Fire to Sleep In"". Layering works for SigfÃºsson, partly because you can't always guess what he will stack next, or when. The path of each song can fork without warning. ""Fafafa"", a mosaic of chopped-up, mealymouthed vocals seems to be going nowhere, before this prelude suddenly burgeons into a miniature orchestra, Xeroxing his own voice over itself, but also fastening together piano and organ, and installing it all above a humble rhythm of rattling, twanging percussion. The gorgeous farewell track, ""Lies"", startles the listener with its sheer hymnlike austerity. The crescendo never comes: the train-like percussion never explodes into a frenzy of drums, its faraway vocals never swell into a yell. Instead, SigfÃºsson moans plaintively over the glittering cascade of piano samples, and the momentum really never flags. Equally surprising are the deviations of genre. Apparently an apple amid oranges, ""Melt Down the Knives"" exhausts its dark, Nuggets-via-post-punk energy in two minutes flat. It seems out of place on the record, when you set its macho bombardment of guitars and its air of pessimism against the other tracks. But when you place it beside ""Sunken Ship"", swollen with the baroque machinery of Sgt. Pepper's psychedelia, it illuminates the sources behind Sin Fang Bous's kitchen-sink adventures: the 1960s. It's not unreasonable, in fact, to sense a Spectorian wall of sound in the percussive boom and splash of ""Carry Me Up to Smell Pine"". With an imagination thoroughly sculpted by the past, SigfÃºsson's cut-and-paste folk manages effortlessly to evoke both the psychedelic rockers of yesteryear and more recent enchanters like Stuart Murdoch and Panda Bear.","The one-man project of Sindri MÃ¡r SigfÃºsson, this Morr release mixes predictable comforts with little anxieties and surprises.

False Face Society,Valet,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4aac0084474cd0c053c/1:1/w_160/33801d13.jpg,2009-06-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13145-false-face-society/,Mexican Summer,"Valet is the music-making moniker of Portland's queen of indie multitasking, Honey Owens-- proprietor of a vintage clothing shop, part owner of a record label, co-founder of a rock venue, and longtime band hopper who's jammed with the likes of Jackie O Motherfucker and Atlas Sound. She's very busy, to say the least. Owens is signed to the venerable leftfield/experimental label Kranky for her long players, but for False Face Society, a more off-the-cuff and improvisational piece than her past two solo projects, she's hanging with vinyl- and digital-only boutique imprint Mexican Summer. Since False Face Society's release is limited to just 500 physical units, only diehard fans will score a copy on wax, but of course, the internet will find the record a wider audience than that.Â For those who discovered Valet through her drugged-out 2008 drone exploration, Naked Acid-- a highly accomplished, underrated album-- this three-song suite might be harder to swallow. While far from a pop record, Naked Acid found Valet increasingly comfortable with structure; she was more willing to ground her ambient-and-noise journeys within the confines of quote-unquote songs, and in that sense it felt like a step forward. For this EP, though, Valet returns to the sparser candlelit psych hymns of her first full-length, Blood Is Clean. To some, it will feel like backpedaling, but I would caution against reading too much into a release like this. Less an investigation into new territory, False Face Society seems more like a brief pit stop, a temporary release valve for a busy creative mind. Still, the three songs included here aren't Valet's finest work to date. The first of two original pieces isÂ ""Angels Can't Stop"", a mostly instrumental slow builder with a composed-on-the-fly quality about it. Slowed-heartbeat pulses and distant wooden percussion play next to Owens'Â far-off vocals, which are purposefully indecipherable here. Moving in a few distinct phases, the track's several moods bleed into one another gracefully, but at 15-plus minutes it meanders more than necessary. And with its treated vocals and guttural synths, the drone-yÂ ""Dealer vs. Ocean""Â is colder and more mechanical than we're used to from Owens; it doesn't quite reach the trippy transcendence of her previous work. But even if the record's first two cuts seem sort of half-formed, fans will no doubt be excited for its final number, a dazzling impressionistic cover of Boris and Michiho Kurihara'sÂ ""Rainbow""Â from 2006. This is, of course, the sort of cross-continental musical pollination between esteemed artists that us geeks go apeshit over, and luckily the song delivers. Riding the same elliptical guitar pattern as the original,Â ""Rainbow""Â starts and ends with a whisper, but lets its drum circle pitter-patter and echoed harmonies find a dreamy equilibrium in the center. Even ifÂ ""Rainbow""Â is worth the price of admission alone, False Face Society is certainly missing some of the components that made Naked Acid and Blood Is Clean, to a slightly lesser degree, great. (A focus on Owens' ethereal singing, the sort of Black Dice-esque atonal adventurousness of tracks such asÂ ""Fire"", to name a few.) But, again, we're talking about just three tracks (not enough to really guess at Valet's trajectory from here), so there's little reason to doubt that she has more great music in her.","More improvisational than her recent, excellent Kranky material, Honey Owens' latest is a limited-edition LP via vinyl- and digital-only boutique Mexican Summer.

Absu,Absu,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a430c0084474cd0c0433/1:1/w_160/282644a3.jpg,2009-06-09 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13044-absu/,Candlelight,"Nike's Original Run series assigns artists--Â so far they've teamed with LCD Soundsystem, De La Soul, A-Trak, and Aesop Rock--Â a daunting commission: create a singular piece of music to score a 50-minute jog, from warm-up to cool-down.Â Should Nike decide to add a metal track to its Original Run series, it needs look no further than United States Black Metal pioneers Absu. The group's first album in eight years, Absu, is anÂ energizingÂ sprint through black metal, bedrock thrash, symphonic flourishes, and arcane mythological references. All told, it's so intense that, by cool down, you might still be contemplating the first verse of that warm-up. Indeed, layers of density define the record--Â in sonics, in lyrics, in the completely triumphant, surprisingly melodic manner in which itÂ merges the two. But first thing's first: Absu sounds perfect and immense, its cleanly recorded and carefully mixed presentation revealing the intricacy of Absu's ideas and the power of their musicianship. DuringÂ ""Nunbarshegunu"",Â singer and drummer Proscriptor's percussion climaxes early before stretching his slowdown over a full minute, eventually settling into a mid-tempo trot. Bolstered by Absu's sleek sense of production, each hit sounds like an explosion. Multi-instrumentalists Zawicizuz and Aethyris--Â making their debuts with Absu here--Â offer similar Ã©lan and adventure. Then there's the question of what Proscriptor is actually screaming, singing, and growling over the music. Last month, he described the album's content to Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy as a mix ofÂ ""Sumerian mythology, Mesopotamian cosmology, Goetia, numerology, and antiquated necromancy.""Â In simpler terms, a post-script in the liner notes reads,Â ""Absu arrogantly executes mythological occult metal... still.""Â Essentially, Proscriptor welds together some of the oldest, if least-known, belief systems in the world, connecting them through parables and narratives that share a unifying desire for absolute power.Â ""Nunbarshegunu"",Â for instance, recalls a classic tale of Sumerian mythology in which one god rapes his potential bride, begetting Sin. Two tracks later, Proscriptor offers a doxology for Goetia, a sort of sorcery where the relationship of shapes and numbers connects one to extra-human powers. The aim, then, isn't alien to that of many metal lineages, from Viking lore to Satanic advocacy. But the devices themselves represent a clear deviation from the hegemony of most black metal. Proscriptor does more than drop names he's seen in books or on Wikipedia. He combines figures and tales, mixing the narratives and merging the belief systems to argue for chaos in the place of common sense or wisdom. You could spend the rest of the year exploring the ideas and jargon here (Seriously: scimitars, mages, Ninik, afreets, cantrips, Nisir, planets colliding, veils,Â ""combustion is ascendancy""), and this simple conclusion would likely remain: Proscriptor has a problem with power, but he needs more of it. Of course, the first two factors wouldn't matter if Absu couldn't combine them into songs that compel and an album that coheres. They execute both rather brilliantly. Anyone can play heavy and scream obscure occult references, after all, but I'm suggesting a major corporate commission. There are big hooks on Absu, from the half-time stomp of the chorus inÂ ""Amy""Â to the infectious little bit about astral planes and Elder Ones duringÂ ""...Of the Dead Who Never Rest in Their Tombs Are the Attendance of Familiar Spirits...""Â Speaking of that tune and being restless, Absu never sit still.Â ""Dead""Â is a seven-minute epic in three parts, morphing from a relentless blast of black metal to a psychedelic synthesizer solo to a sinister farewell of strings and noise. Some songs have three choruses. Some have none. The action comes in sustained waves, and each time it feels as if Absu's energy has peaked, the trio ratchets the intensity higher still. Four minutes intoÂ ""Ye Uttuku Spells"",Â for instance, Proscriptor bellowsÂ ""Ye Absu rage""Â above a steady holding pattern. The proclamation is laughable in its redundancy, as Absu have done nothing if not rage for the prior 50 minutes. The last words of the album's last verse, they suggest a captain finally cracking as he leads his men into one last battle. And sure enough, Absu unleash behind Proscriptor's request, a piercing guitar solo peeling from the double-bass drum gallop and the tide of distortion in the middle. It's a perfect last stand, andÂ an unabashedly arrogant close to an album that deserves nothing less.","After an eight-year absence, Absu return with an energizing record of black metal, bedrock thrash, symphonic flourishes, and arcane mythological references.

Man of Aran,British Sea Power,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bb5e6ef95969320935/1:1/w_160/b0924150.jpg,2009-06-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13160-man-of-aran/,Rough Trade,"At a time when ""I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!"" is an international franchise, and ""Shark Week"" programming is among our most-watched TV documentaries, it's hard to imagine that proto-documentarian Robert Flaherty was once considered a game-changer. Flaherty's career as an explorer, filmmaker, and armchair anthropologist had long solidified by 1934, when his third film,Â Man of Aran, stood as the grandest example yet of what had become his trademark style, beginning with 1922's Nanook of the North: traveling to inhospitable regions of the world (in this case, the rocky, sea-scarred Aran islands off the western coast of Ireland) and getting natives to recreate their cultural habits for a worldwide audience of filmgoers eager for safe glimpses of unseen corners of the world. As a filmmaker, Flaherty both solidified much of what we now know as documentary language, and, strangely enough, predicted one of the form's most popular-- and despised-- grandchildren, reality television. Or, maybe reality television is just an incredibly regressive story form. Either way, it's exactly this strange admixture of the modern and postmodern that makes any of Flaherty's works evergreen and ripe for reinterpretation. Ostentatious, self-serious revisionism has been one of British Sea Power's fortes ever since they packaged their 2003 debut album as a ""Classic"" work of history, so it's easy to see why, 75 years later, they'd be up to the unique task of redoing the score for Aran. The Quietus wonderfully explained the unique collusion between narrative and time,Â calling it ""a 21st century attempt to complement a 20th century film about an often 19th century way of life."" It becomes quickly clear that, while their interpretation is sympathetic to the original, BSP are meeting Flaherty on their own terms. The band repurposed three of its own moody, atmospheric numbers for inclusion in the score (""North Hanging Rock"", ""True Adventures"", and ""The Great Skua""), winkingly name the last piece ""No Man Is an Archipelago"", and has beenÂ brazen enough in the liner notes to regard Aran, which Flaherty intended originally to be a noble man vs. sea tale of survival against the elements, as ""at once heroic, stunning, camp, ridiculous... everything a rock band should be."" Though Flaherty has been roundly (and often rightly) criticized for romanticizing his subjects as isolated, noble primitives, in this context one of his most notoriously ballsy quotes is innocent enough to unironically headline the liners: ""I should have been shot for what I asked these superb people to do, all for the sake of a keg of porter and five pounds a piece."" It doesn't rise to the level of firing squad, but the band's cover of ""Come Wander With Me"", a 1964 Jeff Alexander number originally included in a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, is the starkest example of the band's own form of poetic license. The song's lyrics are mundane romantic escapism, standing in stark counterpoint to the scene they butt heads with: a family scours its barren home for seaweed and returns home with their catch strapped to horses, walking waist-deep in water. They'll ""wander"" later, thanks. Part of the mystery of BSP's score, indeed, is trying to parse if the band's actively playing with the touristic gaze that Flaherty was immune to, or if they're just ignoring it. Either way, it's sort of eerie. When the score and visuals work together, though, the effect can be stunning. As the men return from an expedition in a small canoe, the opening ""The South Sound"" sequence flows forward from a nervous first movement of minor key piano and dark cello into a tumultuous post-rock freakout, as the family is thrown against the rocks by the sea's raging waves, trying to bring ashore the day's catch.Â  Later, the ""Boy Vertiginous""/""Spearing the Sunfish"" section is the best-- both through Flaherty's virtuosic filmmaking and BSP nailing the dramatic tension. The sequence crosscuts between a young boy catching a fish with a rock tied to a string and a group of men showing how adults do it-- killing a shark with a spear, from a tiny fishing boat. As Flaherty cuts to a shot of the grizzled hunters cresting a hill, BSP swell to a crescendo straight out of Hollywood, and it's the most goosebump-inducing moment in the film. The sequence doesn't let up for several minutes, either-- even as a recreation, it took two days to get the shark back to shore-- and when the men are struggling with the shark, Flaherty's rapid cutting works perfectly with BSP's rocking the fuck out. An important thing to keep in mind when watching Aran is that British Sea Power were most likely not willing (or able) to alter the original film in any way, and this tether often works to their disadvantage. For his part, Flaherty was working several decades before video killed the radio star, and the band doesn't work too hard to meet his 1930s style halfway. There are a more than a few times, then, when BSP's attempts to build dramatic tension feel out of sync with Flaherty's pacing and technique. Right in the middle of ""Sunfish"", for instance, a title card pops up-- Flaherty informing us how dangerous the shark is-- while the cacophonous music continues with conspicuous indifference. The last third of the film contains some of its most stunning visuals, but BSP's score plays as nostalgic what Flaherty seemed to intend as anxious. Will the father, away on another mission during a storm, return home safe? Let's take a reflective walk along the coast and think about it. But this is the trick, it seems: The real power of the visual/musical connection between Flaherty and BSP comes if you regard it not as a traditional film, but as a music video. In other words, you have to let the music drive the visual, instead of vice-versa.Â  It's still not a transcendent translation-- 75 years might as well be a thousand in popular-culture time-- and I would still highly recommend screening the original film (might it have been nice to include the original score and ambient sound as a separate track?). The shift in perspective necessary to ""get"" it, though, does work on that level: at the least, it's a fitting testimonial to British Sea Power's partially effective relocation of a classic film into a modern aesthetic scheme.","BSP take on Robert Flaherty's Man of Aran 75 years after its release, giving the proto-documentary a new,Â occasionally stunningÂ soundtrack.

Bitte Orca,Dirty Projectors,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b9ea9e61561daa4f93/1:1/w_160/cc6b59a3.jpeg,2009-06-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/,Domino,"I've heard Dave Longstreth cursed at length, and I've heard him compared to some of the lesser deities. In the Dirty Projectors frontman we have a fellow whoÂ fancies himself not so much a songwriter as a modern composer, a Yale grad with one of indie rock's most divisive voices. Early DPs records carry with them ambitions so grandiose it's no wonder they range from wildly inventive to practically unlistenable-- occasionally in the span of the same song. Then there was 2007's Rise Above, which saw Longstreth and company misremembering the hell out of Black Flag's Damaged by slathering embellishment onto one of the most gloriously unadorned LPs ever. It wasn't exactly a gimmick, but-- and I say this as a fan of both of those records-- it wasn't all that far from one. In spite of its comparatively light tone and the band's tight clutch on melody and rhythm, it was art-damaged and, to some, impenetrable. However you sized it up, you had to admit it was intriguing, even if your interest level waned with every passing yelp. This has heretofore been the story of Dirty Projectors: a band so brainy, so good at the very particular thing they do, they can be hard to like. Now comesÂ Bitte Orca, the band's best, andÂ certainly most likable,Â album by a mile. Bitte doesn't actually switch up the Rise Above formula that much: Intricate (if roomier) full-band arrangements abound, Longstreth largely sticks with his clear King Sunny Ade-meets-Jimmy Page guitar acrobatics, and he's still singing his strange, loping songs with that voice. But it whittles down the jarring time signatures and off-kilter arrangements and vocal bleats (er, for the most part) to create a triumphant art-pop record destined to please longtime fans and win him a whole slew of new ones. The key is that, rather surprisingly,Â Bitte Orca is one of the more purely enjoyable indie-rock records in an awfully long time;Â remarkable by any means, but even moreso considering the source. It's breezy without a hint of slightness, tuneful but with its fair share of tumult, concise and inventive and replayable and plain old fun. It is the sound of Longstreth the composer and Longstreth the pop songwriter finally settling on a few things together after years of tug-of-war between the two. There are some triumphant standalone songs in the DPs back catalogue-- ""Fucked For Life"", ""I Will Truck"", and ""Rise Above"" spring to mind-- but never has Longstreth laid nine of them out in a row, as he does on Bitte Orca. From the chiming opening chords of ""Cannibal Resource"" to the supple swivel that closes ""Fluorescent Half-Dome"", there's a forward motion at play when you spin Bitte Orca all the way through, but it's an album of such a high uniform quality and such indelible range, practically any tune could be your favorite. Songs run the gamut from Zeppelin III-style swirl (sorta-title-track ""Useful Chamber"") to delicate balladry (""Two Doves"", a dead ringer for Nico's cover of Jackson Browne's ""These Days"" and no less gorgeous for it) to R&B bob-and-weave (""Stillness Is the Move"", which owes a great debt to the dearly departed Aaliyah-Timbaland braintrust) to adult-contemporary pop (no shots, ""No Intention"").Â Apart from the ultimately transitional whoosh of the brief ""The Bride"", the run from ""Cannibal Resource"" to ""No Intention"" is as solid and variegated a display of songwriting acumen and instrumental virtuosity as any you'll hear this year. But it sure doesn't feel as heavy as that sentence might have you believe. I don't dare pick one highlight-- hell, my favorites keep changing-- but I'll point to ""Useful Chamber"" as the best encapsulation of what Bitte Orca does so well. A woozy synth line underpins one of Longstreth's gentlest vocal performances to date, a melody line I find myself singing in all sorts of inopportune places. Roughly halfway through, the beat breaks, Longstreth half-raps a little pre-chorus pep talk, and the song explodes in sound and vision. I don't quite understand what Longstreth is going for with the song's whale-plea mantra, but when it sounds like this-- so gigantic, so effortless, so unbelievably catchy-- I could really give a fuck. It's pure bliss, tension that results in glorious release. And while the song-- like the album it features on-- sacrifices precious little of the art-pop leanings of Longstreth's past work, he's traded obfuscation for overtness on nearly all levels, channeled his frenetic energy into paring down the songwriting as opposed to putting it all into the performances, and the results positively sing. I'm only slightly less enamored of Bitte Orca's final twofer than I am with what precedes it, though either would be a clear highlight on any of the other DPs albums. ""Remade Horizon"" starts a bit slow and Longstreth's voice seems a tad strained on the verse melody; despite an ebullient shoutalong chorus, it seems more an excuse for the impressive feat of vocal pummelhorsery from Amber Coffman and Angel Deradoorian in its second half than it does a tune's tune like the seven that come before it. It's the first time on Bitte Orca Longstreth allows chops to stand out in front of the song, and while it's neat to hear them pull it off (and is an absolute marvel in a live setting), it feels showy in a way Bitte Orca otherwise avoids in favor of direct hits. The emphasis on Coffman and Deradoorian's vocals throughout is one of the best things about the record; ""Horizon"" just happens to be the one moment they seem overused-- a problem of arrangement, really-- and it suffers a bit for it. ""Fluorescent Half Dome"" has the opposite problem; it's a bit too simplistic getting going and doesn't quite earn its bizarre chorus. While, like most songs here, it picks up when Coffman and Deradoorian start in with their vocals, it's not quite the closer a record like this deserves. But even focusing on relative difficulty among tracks on the record seems odd: Jaw-dropping virtuosity was the best thing the DPs had going for them prior to Bitte Orca. Here, it stands behind so many other newly apparent strengths-- a testament to the leaps and bounds Longstreth has made as a songsmith and Dirty Projectors have made as a band.","The challenging art-poppers led by Dave Longstreth have made their best and most accessible album, a record that's one of the year's real highlights.

Philadelphia Freeway 2,Freeway,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c713d1975652138db8/1:1/w_160/8c3e9e75.jpg,2009-06-08 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13190-philadelphia-freeway-2/,Real Talk,"At the end of last year, Freeway embarked on a song-a-day scheme called the Month of Madness, giving away 32 songs to blogs in an attempt to build his buzz back up. In an environment when five new single-artist mixtapes come out every day, it didn't really work. But any random 10 songs from the Month of Madness would've made for a better album thanÂ Philadelphia Freeway 2, Free's inexplicable dud of a third album. To put things bluntly,Â PF2 is the kind of album where rappers give interviews telling people not to buy it after it comes out. It's barely an album, really. At 40 minutes, its eight songs come weighed down with skits and prolonged instrumental outros and a remix that adds nothing but a quick (albeit great) Sheek Louch verse to a track we'd already heard.Â And that track is the one where Free talks about getting your baby's mother's gums all cummy (her response: ""yummy yummy""), which we really didn't need to hear twice. Honestly, this album's mere existence is a puzzle. Free's never been a marquee name, but his two previous albums came with thick, expansive production and A-list guests. Both of them carried the all-important Jay-Z co-sign. And if 2007'sÂ Free at Last wasn't the event that his debut was, it still resonated as a truly solid under-the-radar major-label album. As forÂ PF2, it finds Free off Roc-A-Fella. The beats are like K-Mart versions of the swollen soul loops that Just Blaze contributed to the firstÂ Philadelphia Freeway. The only guest is Sheek, a problem for a rapper who's always shined playing his strained, urgent delivery off of his calmer, cooler guests.Â The one thing that comes close to savingÂ Philadelphia Freeway 2 is Freeway himself. He's an incredible rapper. He killed himself animating those great Just Blaze beats, and he kills himself just as hard here. He spits almost every line like it's the last thing anyone will ever hear from him, and he pushes his voice in unexpected new directions even when he has to know nobody is paying attention. It's weirdly inspirational, hearing Free do some incredible work on tracks that could just never be worthy of him. He's like the guy who busts his ass at a minimum-wage go-nowhere job even though he knows he won't earn himself any extra money doing it. It's like he just wants to do a good job. On ""Murda Muzic"", he snarls, ""When I let out a buckshot, you shit-out-of-luck,"" hardening every syllable and turning his delivery into a barreling stutter. On ""Around the World"", he says, ""Your motherfucking aunt run neighborhood watch,"" like it's a withering insult. On ""Streets Won't Miss'em"", he animates a tired kill-snitches concept through sheer demented attention to detail: ""You shoulda did it like a soldier do it/ Now we dousing you with motor fluid."" (He also calls a rat ""Young Fievel"", which is just funny.) And on ""Crack Rap"", he talks about seeing crack addiction slowly break down his uncle, then tells a story about the man begging him for the drug. That scene ends without resolution, Free's uncle finally telling him, ""Tell your mama be over at the house later today to fix the cable box,"" the sort of mundane little touch that drives a heartbreaking story home that much harder. Plenty of rappers these days are working the intersection between sneery tough-talk and soul-bearing confessions; almost none of them are doing it better than Freeway. Free is a furious talent, and it's sad to see him relegated to this weird little nothing of an album. ButÂ Philadelphia Freeway 2 is a detour, not an ending. Later this year, Free will decamp to Rhymesayers to releaseÂ The Stimulus Package, his collaborative album with the great Seattle producer Jake One. This marks Free as the latest once-semi-popular rapper to defect to the welcoming arms of the indie-rap underground. It's always weird seeing that happen to people who showed up on Faith Evans singles not that long ago, but in Free's case, it can't come soon enough. On Rhymesayers, he'll be free of commercial pressure, and he'll get to crank out hard, uncompromising soul jams for people who actually want to hear them. That's a good place for him. Besides, the new songs he did with Jake One at SXSW musically obliterate anything onÂ Philadelphia Freeway 2.","Still an incredible rapper, Freeway's third album-- which follows his month-long song-a-day blog leak from late last year-- is full of questionable decisions.

Survival Strategies in a Modern World,Liechtenstein,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a8c0084474cd0c0538/1:1/w_160/4bb6c539.jpg,2009-06-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13144-survival-strategies-in-a-modern-world/,Slumberland,"In one of the more obvious artist-label partnerships to spring up recently, Liechtenstein of Gothenburg, Sweden, are the latest signees to Slumberland. The resurrected indie-pop imprint is of course responsible for one of this year's breakout acts, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, among other like-minded bands. Liechtenstein represent another entry in Slumberland's current renewal of mid-to-late-1980s American and British indie, but instead of drawing influence from Black Tambourine or early My Bloody Valentine, the all-female group is recreating a very specific strain of guitar-pop also from that era. That music-- woman-fronted new wave bands like Dolly Mixture and the burgeoning twee of Heavenly Records-- is lovingly Xeroxed for a new generation on Liechtenstein's debut album, Survival Strategies In a Modern World. It's a tricky way to get noticed as a new band. Such overt revivalism-- the group's MySpace page announces it ""sounds like: 1984""-- is usually criticized for lack of ambition, which is fair. The same can (and will) be said of Liechtenstein, but their 2009 version of this style is convincing enough possibly to evade such judgments. At the very least, they've nailed the sound. With its tight, intermingling vocal harmonies and crisp instrumentation, Survival Strategies' crystalline pop apes bands whose influence lives on through just a handful of singles. About a third of the record is built upon Dolly Mixture's caffeinated, melodic new wave; the remaining two-thirds is split between Talulah Gosh's blatantly cutesy twee and the jittery post-punk of Girls at Our Best! None of it is truly theirs. But here's the thing: it all sounds pretty good. That's crucial, since even a few sub-par numbers on an album this short (nine songs at under 23 minutes) can do serious damage. Opener ""All at Once"" is probably the track most primed for a breakout here and is a good example of Liechtenstein's approach. Over a dimly-lit backdrop of gloomy guitars and drum beats, the women's voices bleed into one another-- verse becoming chorus and vice-versa-- in such a way that finds extreme catchiness without becoming cloying. Similarly sticky ""Postcard"" and ""By Staying Here (We Will Slowly Disappear)"" reveal the group's more heart-on-sleeve twee side. Lovey-dovey and upbeat, ""Postcard"" is suburban in its charms (""Don't leave the cat on its own, don't leave the lights on when you go,"" they sing), while the latter takes a darkly comedic stab at the desire to leave one's hometown, that classic pop sentiment. ""Chances are we will never make it far,"" they concede in a Morrissey/Stuart Murdoch kind of moment. But on a record like this one, it's hard to say if just having good songs is enough. One almost needs an appreciation for the music Liechtenstein is looking to restore in order to enjoy the album. And though the band does a fine job of balancing its very poppy poppiness with darker textures, the sugary qualities so present throughout can become overwhelming. (The band almost admits as much on final track ""The End"", where they eventually jettison effervescent guitar pop in favor of a lovely acoustic ballad.) But because its aim is so specific and backward-looking, Survival Strategies seems destined to be the sort of record that gets lost in the shuffle, enjoyed briefly then set aside. It might serve as a real treat for devout fans of its niche or a point of entry for those unfamiliar, but in order to really stand on its own, an album needs to do more than that.","Latest signees to Slumberland are from Gothenburg, Sweden, and they faithfully recreate the sound of a highly specific strain of 1980s indie pop.

Vicious Circle / History Of,Zero Boys,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b8ea9e61561daa4d46/1:1/w_160/88b84310.jpg,2009-06-08 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12941-vicious-circle-history-of/,Secretly Canadian,"If word count is any measure, the New York and Los Angeles underground scenes of the late 1970s still get the lion's share of attention as punk's primary stomping grounds. But while there's no arguing the impact of all the acts that proliferated on the coasts, they likely would have stayed local phenomena if not for the various sub-scenes scattered across the country that supported and connected punk's spread. The vast Midwest could make its own fun, thank you very much, and the history books are finally beginning to reflect the rogue's gallery of pioneering punk and hardcore acts that cropped up everywhere from Chicago and Minneapolis to Cleveland and Indianapolis. Yes, Indianapolis, birthplace of Zero Boys, Indiana's own brick in punk's foundation, and a pioneer in several other regards as well. While Johnny Cougar was first making his name, Zero Boys were starting their own label, Z-Disc, and recording the imprint's 7"" EP debut Livin' in the '80s. Even as it garnered play on college radio, the EP was met with some of the usual flyover-country dismissals-- Indiana? Really?-- even as the group earned respect for holding its own against bands from hipper environs. The 80s had barely begun, but with that EP, Zero Boys made their early bid for the decade. Of course, it was not to be. Like most punk bands, the group burned bright but fast, yet the limited Zero Boys legacy remains pretty impressive nonetheless, especially as heard on the original lineup's sole full-length, Vicious Circle, and the formerly cassette-only clearing house History Of, which between the two of them comprise the sum total of Zero Boys' '79 to '83 era. The five-song Livin' in the '80s EP is included on History Of, and those tracks capture the group in its most formative (if already strikingly confident) stages. Vicious Circle, on the other hand, marks the great leap forward that went nowhere but still stands as one of punk's more consistent blasts of fun and fury. ""Vicious Circle is practically unique among hardcore punk albums, since it was professionally recorded and performed by seasoned rock'n'roll musicians,"" blogged longtime fan John P. Strohm, formerly of the Lemonheads and Blake Babies, but back in 1981 a teenager in Bloomington whose mind was blown by Zero Boys. Indeed, while hardcore was drumming the melodies out of punk, Zero Boys were capably pairing tunes with fast tempos. Not that the 40-second introductory title track doesn't hone to the loud 'n' fast rules, but by ""Amphetamine Addiction"" the band has blasted off into tight tangents equally informed by Black Flag's muscle, the cynical Dead Kennedys, and the madness of the Germs, with a hint of the rockabilly swing that propelled X. If most of the songs hover below the ultra-efficient two-minute mark, it's remarkable how good they sound, bearing few marks of punk's proud amateurishness. The group's still livin' in the 80s, as its snotty de rigueur anti-establishment subject matter reflects, but songs such as ""Drug Free Youth"", ""Hightime"", ""Trying Harder"", and ""Down the Drain"" (with its almost Minutemen-like bass runs) stand on the same level as that era's other punk high points. They're loud and fast, and yes, they rule. The classic Zero Boys line-up disbanded in 1983 while recording what would be the follow-up to Vicious Circle, but what was salvaged from those sessions is collected on History Of. While not on par with the debut, this disc of long-lost leftovers isn't the sound of some flash in the pan struggling to come up with a sequel, either. The group's clearly full of good ideas, and as tight as ever. That Zero Boys never made it over this hump is a shame, if not an outright tragedy, but with the set-- and in particular songs such as ""Inergy"", ""Seen That Movie Before"", and ""Amerika"", the last of which actually tops three minutes-- fans new and old can now get a taste of what could have been.","Overlooked early-1980s Indianapolis band is given a thorough reissue treatment, proving once again that vital punk rock was being made all over.

West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum,Kasabian,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b4ea9e61561daa4f83/1:1/w_160/056b52a3.jpg,2009-06-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13154-west-ryder-pauper-lunatic-asylum/,RCA,"What did Kasabian do that was so bad? I realize that trying to play the sympathy card is pretty futile when that cover is staring back at you, but Kasabian have seemed like the sort of group whose punishment has been disproportionate to their musical crimes. Sure, Americans have become conditioned to cast a wary eye towards the vast majority of NME-hyped bands from across the pond, and the UK pubs seem to hype them simply for their ability to evoke a chemically altered 90s nostalgia-- you know, the kind of stuff that never happens here... Trying to hold Kasabian to the standards, or at least the sensibilities, of our more recent indie faves is like wondering why beer commercials never license, I dunno, Sunn O))). As it is, West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum can be pretty enjoyable when operating from its position of strength, completely from the neck down. If you just can't get enough distorted bass, then by the time ""Fast Fuse"" comes hurtling down the pike, you might be ready to toss this in your top 10. Or you might like it about as much as the Music's last record. Either way, there's almost a hip-hop approach to Kasabian's better songs here-- as long as those hydraulic riffs take up as much space as the chunky breakbeats, nearly anything sounds good over it. Which really helps when you're dealing with a guy like Tom Meighan, whose lyricism can be most kindly described as ""an afterthought."" Songs called ""Underdog"" and ""Where Did All the Love Go?"" both manage to slip in references to bar fighting, and the latter implores the listener to steal a hobo's wine. I would joke about how this stuff will never go out of style as long as EA keeps making soccer games, but ""Fast Fuse"" actually is on ""FIFA 09"". When taking advantage of the opportunity to be as dumb as they need/want to be, West Ryder succeeds, which is another way of saying acoustic guitars have absolutely no reason to be involved. Okay, maybe that's going a bit overboard; after all, even XTRMNTR had slow songs on it. Thing is, those songs were actually slow and provided something resembling contrast, but Meighan attacks with the same cant throughout. During West Ryder's incomprehensibly misguided midsection and final quarter, Kasabian lumber through a rash of poky Kinks pastiches as if the Kooks don't already have a monopoly on that front, and Meighan's inability to show range trickles down to the rest of the group. As long as retro-obsessed bands make third albums, you're going to have the use of Panda Express-authentic touches of Oriental drone (""Take Aim""). As long as Screamadelica is considered a (rightful) classic, you're going to get lesser attempts at ""I'm Comin' Down"", and here they're called ""Ladies & Gentlemen (Roll the Dice)"", ""Fire"", and ""Happiness"". And as long as bands have the ability to do stuff like this, they'll get someone like Rosario Dawson for a misguided and interminably long Bonnie & Clyde roleplay (""West Ryder Silver Bullet""). These are all things hundreds of bands do far better than Kasabian, still stuck in a somewhat uncomfortable position of being very good at a style of electro-based rock that's considered pretty unfashionable, right or wrong.","Still excelling when sticking to the unfashionable sound of electro-based rock, Kasabian, alas, also make the requisite ""mature"" moves on their third album.

The Eternal,Sonic Youth,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b3ea9e61561daa4f7d/1:1/w_160/7ec8b918.jpg,2009-06-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13153-the-eternal/,Matador,"The Eternal, Sonic Youth's 16th album, has nothing to hide. Its strengths and weaknesses are all upfront-- in fact they're pretty well encapsulated in the first two tracks. OpenerÂ ""Sacred Trickster""Â is a quick, adrenalized rocker in the vein of 2006's similarly straightforward Rather Ripped. Slamming to a stop after a tight two minutes, the band then tears intoÂ ""Anti-Orgasm"",Â exploding into biting noise halfway through before the song eventually drifts into beatific, instrumental wandering. It's a familiar move that Sonic Youth have deployed to strong effect many times (tryÂ ""Pacific Coast Highway""Â on 1987's Sister orÂ ""Rain on Tin""Â on 2002'sÂ ""Murray Street for starters). But here it seems to come too soon-- an auto-pilot turn that rings a bit off-key. The rest of The Eternal runs through similar cycles of ebb and flow. And while the flow outweighs the ebb, it doesn't always defeat it. Many of the band's signature styles are well-timed: the concise blasts from guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo during the bridge ofÂ ""Calming the Snake"",Â the slow-building denouement ofÂ ""Walkin Blue"",Â the acoustic flourishes that give closerÂ ""Massage the History""Â a chilly mood.Â But sometimes the go-to moves feel forced-- take Moore's stiff rant onÂ ""Thunderclap (For Bobby Pyn)"",Â or the dead-end bridge ofÂ ""Leaky Lifeboat (For Gregory Corso)"".Â The best Sonic Youth albums cohere enough to withstand missteps--sometimes even make virtues out of them-- but here the stutter-steps stick out a bit, putting The Eternal on a middle rung of Sonic Youth's discographical ladder. Which still means it's pretty damn good. There's no denying the vitality of songs likeÂ ""Antenna"",Â a Moore sing-the-guitar-line classic akin to A Thousand Leaves'Â ""Sunday""Â or Murray Street'sÂ ""The Empty Page"".Â ""Radios play nothing when she's far away/ TV antenna rusts and gone to waste,""Â Moore contemplates, his voice decaying along with his chiming strings.Â Just as good are two Ranaldo songs, the aforementionedÂ ""Walkin Blue""-- a swaying rocker with Beat poet-influenced couplets-- andÂ ""What We Know"",Â sort of an elongated update on Rather Ripped'sÂ ""Rats"".Â ""Heaven's not about your reputation,""Â he sings, musing about ""stepping across the great divide.""Â Like much of The Eternal,Â ""What We Know""Â seems fixated on death, loss, and what little can be known about either. High points like that might hit harder without some surrounding lags, like the ZZ-Top-on-downersÂ ""Poison Arrow"", or the weary yeah-yeah's ofÂ ""Thunderclap (for Bobby Pyn)""-- especially since each of those tunes is followed by a similar, much better track. The chugging guitars ofÂ ""Malibu Gas Station""Â trumpÂ ""Poison Arrow""Â with sped-up, Television-like twin-guitar, while the wiry energy ofÂ ""No Way"",Â with its Ramones-ish chorus (""I'm not talking to you no more,""Â chants Moore), echoes classic punk better thanÂ ""Thunderclap"". But then it's easy to nitpick with a group that has been this good for this long and always offers a lot to comb through and dissect. Besides,Â The Eternal could turn out to be a grower. It certainly has happened before with Sonic Youth, whose unique place in rock history-- as a kind of living glue between late-70s post-punk and 90s alternative, 80s DIY indie and 00s net-age, tight pop and improvised noise, hard punk and hippie jams, etc.-- is secure, no matter what time reveals about individual albums.Â At the very least, some excellent songs lurk among these 12 tracks, and there's enough potential for debate about which are which to make The Eternal worthy of Sonic Youth's singular canon.","A consolidation of the band's considerable strengths, much of the new SY album seemsÂ fixated on death, loss, and what little can be known about either.

"All Is Wild, All Is Silent",Balmorhea,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44a5e6ef9596932083a/1:1/w_160/860f01e3.jpg,2009-06-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13066-all-is-wild-all-is-silent/,Western Vinyl,"""Settler""-- the multi-movement opener of Balmorhea's third album, All Is Wild, All Is Silent-- serves as much as a proclamation as it does a piece of music: A galloping piano line lifts high and wide, and strings push up from both sides. A razor-thin electric guitar and fleet drums add bulk from beneath just before the song's first half empties into silence, the piano notes scattering through the tape like fireworks across a dark sky. A finger-picked acoustic guitar returns, peaking from beneath the ashes before springing into big, open chords. This time, a larger, more emphatic ensemble joins, offering handclaps alongside a kickdrum and chanted harmonies around the rhythm. Balmorhea-- formerly so quiet and subtle, a duo plus guests-- suddenly feel like a large choir stomping and singing behind their minister's springtime revival. For their first two albums, Austin's Balmorhea gingerly augmented basic but beautiful piano and acoustic guitar patterns with electronics, field recordings, and strings to create exquisite if polite instrumental music. Like the minimal wire mobiles of American artist Alexander Calder, the songs were as much about the shadow they cast-- the full effect of Calder's work depended on the light in the room or the color of the walls; Balmorhea's pliable sound bent to one's emotional state-- as they were about any specific confluence of notes. But out of the gate, ""Settler"" exclaims an expanded six-piece lineup and a less nebulous direction, offering the sort of resolution Balmorhea have long foregone. Like ""Gobbledigook"", the handclap-heavy pop gem that led Sigur RÃ³s' MeÃ° suÃ° Ã­ eyrum viÃ° spilum endalaust last year, ""Settler"" declares that its makers are capable of something other than slow-building brood. That growth doesn't come without its pains, though. At its worst, All Is Wild recalls watching a once-charming child transition through a difficult puberty while one can only stand aside, wishing upon it a beautiful adulthood. See, Balmorhea have always made romantic music. For piano, think Philip Glass' Glassworks, not Charlemagne Palestine's Strumming Music; for guitar, less Takoma, more Windham Hill. But themes that formerly worked as suggestive romantic skeletons become melodramatic and maudlin to the point of distraction here. In full-band form, Balmorhea can sound terribly stiff, hidebound into odd angles by the parts they've built. ""Harm & Boon"", for example, smolders with piano and strings up front but suddenly springs into full-rock mode, a splintering electric guitar grinding across a simple beat. The guitar and the strings move in countering intervals, crisscrossing the rhythm in interlocking webs. The instruments don't move with grace or freedom, though, as much as they simply seem to be reading notes from a page. The movements become awkward tumbles and recoveries, unsuccessful attempts to create musical elasticity that releases and restores potential energy in gallops. The album is even sequenced to that non-effect: Tracks one, three, and five are all distended, jarring pieces with grand crescendos; the even-numbered tunes are like warm tiger balm, gentle numbers meant to massage the tension of their surroundings. Like the tracks themselves, the arches prove a tad mechanical. Despite all this, All Is Wild suggests a bright future for Balmorhea, even if by way of an unfortunate present. Although the band's expanded beyond the spartan approach of its earlier works, the material maintains a blissfully elemental complexity, meaning that-- even if the lines twist and the crescendos stack-- Balmorhea's remains the sort of chamber rock music that can be explored in a backyard or in a living room by friends playing without plugs. At its best, it returns demanding classical grandeur to a comfortable folk base. What's more, many of the individual textures and themes here are brilliant, from the patient, walking banjo-and-guitar line that leads ""Remembrance"" to the strings slashing back through the inspiring build of ""Coahuila"". And the album's closing third-- three interconnected tunes that rise and slink with a patience that the album's start skips-- is perfect, steadily winding through radiant acoustic tones. The swells are surefooted, and the various movements seem designed for one another, not simply stapled together. In their own quiet way, these 14 finishing minutes recall Menomena's instrumental opusÂ Under an Hour, which carefully united dozens of divergent themes into one broad, welcoming landscape.Â Those minutes alone are reason enough to put aÂ lot of faith in Balmorhea's future","Texas instrumental duo deftly draws from a wide, expected lexicon of folk, classical, jazz, and 20th century classical musicians.

Gentlemania,Kevin Blechdom,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45b13d1975652138cbf/1:1/w_160/e68245e7.jpg,2009-06-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13080-gentlemania/,Sonig,"Kevin Blechdom's discography is packed with reliable anomalies. So much so that it's almost pointless to mention that she was one-half of the (newly reunited) electronic duo Blectum From Blechdom. After eight years and a few solo albums, the glitchy, rude electronic music she made with partner Blevin Blectum tells you little about how she got to where she is, and a lot about the kinds of musical leaps Blechdom makes from record to record. Gentlemania is just the latest of Blechdom's albums about relationships. On 2005's Eat My Heart Out, she packed in confessional songs, tracks that wrapped heartache in humor. Blechdom spilled her guts, both literally (the cover features her topless with a handful of animal entrails) and figuratively, though she did so over programed pop ballads and cheery musical numbers. Three years earlier, onÂ I Heart Presets, Blechdom made tender tracks about labelmate Miguel Depedro (Kid606). She's gotten wiser over time, observing love as an absurdity far stranger than the absurdities she'd imagined on past records. And her music has fallen into more recognizable genre conventions, as if Blechdom's decided her feelings were scrambled and jarring enough on their own. Her genre is emotion, not sound. Though Gentlemania cycles through a few (musical theater pomp, bluegrass, torch song), it feels closest to the light pop of 1970s and 80s confessional singer-songwriters, their mix of vulnerability and wry self-awareness. ""Lazy"", swings back and forth with its pretty piano chorus and whistled melody. It sways somewhere between the lovelorn soul-lite of Tapestry-era Carole King, and the breezy quirk of, say, Captain and Tenille. The profane, jokey nature of her past albums gives way to a sweetly innocent lyrical sense, delivered in Blechdom's boyish voice. On ""It's All Been Done Before"", she calls her lover the ""best thing since sliced bread"" and the one curse word in ""Lazy"", is blocked out by a slide whistle. Blechdom's songwriting partner and producer, Mocky, deserves a lot of credit for the evenness and subtle complexity of these songs, hinting at different genres and moods without spilling over into comedy or arbitrary stylistic variation. Knowing exactly when to crescendo, or when to drop in a chorus of backing voices, makes Blechdom's simplest songs sound bigger, torchier. It's nice to see Blechdom find places where vulnerability doesn't equal weakness. Across Gentlemania she says ""please"" but never begs. She doles out equal amounts of self-criticism and complaints. On ""Monster"", a highlight that, unlike most of the other tracks, indulges in balls-out bluegrass banjo and uninhibited ""yeehaws,"" her twang wraps around an admission: ""My brain don't work/ My heart's a jerk,"" she admits. Joke songs are never this apologetic, nor are they usually followed by a song as pretty and heartfelt as ""Running Away"", where Blechdom realizes that she must put off a relationship until she and her lover are more mature, just so the two ""won't feel so alone."" Still, I didn't expect that Blechdom's wild imagination would lead her so close to convention. And so there are elements of Gentlemania where it's hard to tell if she's included them because they're par for the genre, or because she's falling into clichÃ©. She's too smart for the latter, though I wonder why she uses boilerplate wordplay (""I need the rest of you/ I need a rest from you,"" ""Don't think it over/ Don't think it's over,"" ""It's all been done before/ But we're not done for"") so often. There's something sweet about Blechdom making an album this earnest, but I miss her perverse sense of humor. No point in asking after it or saying you'd like to hear something different next time; she's probably two albums ahead anyway.","Another left turn for the always interesting artist, this LPÂ touches on theater and torch songs but feels closest to confessional singer-songwriter music.

Sketches of Spain: Legacy Edition,Miles Davis,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a464b1335d7bf169894d/1:1/w_160/68063ce1.jpg,2009-06-05 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13088-sketches-of-spain-legacy-edition/,Legacy,"Is this even jazz? Sketches of Spain was perhaps the first Miles Davis album to inspire this question, though it certainly wouldn't be the last. Originally released in 1960, it was Davis' studio follow-up to the landmark Kind of Blue, and it found him, yet again, striking out in an entirely new direction. Working with arranger Gil Evans, Davis cooked up a concept album, looking to the structure and texture of Spanish folk and classical music for inspiration. The two old friends and collaborators were on a huge roll creatively during this period. Davis was piling up hall of fame-caliber jazz albums with alarming regularity, while Evans, in addition to working with Davis frequently in the late 1950s, recorded what was perhaps his finest solo album in 1960, Out of the Cool (it vaguely shares a vibe with Sketches, but is in my estimation just a hair better). So to say both were in strong form here would be an understatement. Davis takes what is most striking about his trumpet style-- the controlled soloing in the middle register, with a mastery of subtle shifts in focus-- and amplifies it, creating measured phrases of almost painful intensity. While Evans' distinctive approach to harmony and tonal color-- one of the most enjoyable ""Hey, I get it!"" moments as you first explore jazz is when you start to recognize his arrangements-- inhabits a form that to the uninitiated can sound mysterious and exotic and sensual. It's hard not to be taken in immediately. And that's the first thing to note about Sketches of Spain: Where Davis' ""Is this jazz?"" albums from the late-60s forward were often dense and challenging (""Is this even music?"" even came up now and then), Sketches of Spain was always easy to like. So much so that, like its predecessor, it became the kind of record that someone with only two or three albums by jazz artists might have in their collection. That's partly up to its potential contexts being so variable. There's a lot going on in the music that rewards a close listen, but it's also something you can put on and read to (though admittedly, some of the dynamic surges could be a little jolting). It's often quiet and atmospheric, at points coming over as almost ambient. It's the kind of album that dims the light in the room whenever it plays. It's also absolutely gorgeous. The writers of The Penguin Guide to Jazz felt that the moodiness of Sketches of Spain dominated to the point where it added up to something closer to glorified elevator music. There is some merit to their claim, but the criticism now seems, interestingly, dated. The majority of people encountering a record like Sketches of Spain for the first time probably have no special interest in jazz as an idea, and the notion of pursuing atmospheric records whose primary selling point is an overriding feel and an abiding surface-level prettiness is nothing to be embarrassed about. If we want something more forward with more improvisation and interplay, hey, there are a billion other records out there. But Sketches of Spain does something special. There's a real charge that comes from the distant, clattering percussion that begins ""Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio)"", the opening track and centerpiece. It's a piece by Spanish composer JoaquÃ­n Rodrigo, and if you hear it played with a classical guitar and full orchestra, you realize both how faithful Evans was to it in terms of structure and what he accomplished as far as texture. Using French horn, harp, oboe, and bassoon, as well as more typically jazz brass instruments like trumpet and trombone (Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb, the rhythm section of Davis' band, are both on hand, but they're playing charts-- there's no room here for improvisation), Evans creates a shifting tapestry of luscious sound. Sometimes the music just seems to hang in the air, and sometimes it lurches toward an unexpected climax. Davis is the only soloist on the record, and he burrows deeply into the melodies, turning them over with a huge, bulbous tone that's both strong and vulnerable. He sounds especially impassioned on ""Saeta"", a piece whose scales reflect the influence of North African music on flamenco. It opens with a march and a fanfare, and then Davis blasts an uncanny solo-- slow, choosing between a small handful of notes, but so intent and concentrated that his trumpet almost seems to be splintering. The contrasts between Evans velvety but complex backdrops and Davis' extemporaneous work out front is compelling from start to finish. The problem with this edition is a familiar one to anyone who has followed the never-ending Miles Davis reissue campaign: There's an extra disc of material here, all of which was issued elsewhere and most of which is of interest primarily to collectors, and that extra disc inflates the suggested retail of the set to $25. That's a lot of scratch when you get down to what you're really paying for if you don't own the set already, and that's the first five tracks from the original record, 41 minutes of music total. Disc One, in addition to the full album, does contain the sessions' one true outtake, ""Song of Our Country"". It's easy to see why it was left off, since its tone is several shades brighter and the arrangement is more firmly entrenched in jazz proper-- it actually sounds closer to something from Miles Ahead, the 1957 Evans/Davis big band set. But it's still worth owning, even if it was later compiled into one of Davis' many odds-and-ends sets, 1980's Directions. Eight of the 11 tracks on the second disc consist of alternate takes, including four that cover sections of ""Concierto"". As good as some of this material is, you'll never reach for this sequence over the master unless you're researching the subtle differences in the solos. A live version of ""Concierto"" from 1961, the only time Davis performed this material in concert, is the most worthwhile inclusion by far. But by the end of the disc we're hearing ""Teo"" from the 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come, and all of a sudden Coltrane is soloing, which makes no sense whatsoever in this painstakingly arranged context. As the notes indicate, ""Teo"" bears a melodic and thematic resemblance to material on Sketches, and though that's true, its inclusion here is dubious. It seems more a way to pad out a set that needs to be of a certain length to justify the price tag. Better that this edition had included ""Song of Our Country"" and the live ""Concierto"" as bonus cuts on a single disc. The liner notes, by composer Gunther Schuller, a ""Third Stream"" pioneer who mixed jazz and classical, are informative and well done and do add value. The music benefits from his analysis, which is technical but still accessible. So the score given here reflects a compromise between the vast musical riches of the original album and the questionable packaging of the reissue. I wish I could say that Sketches is an album that turntable owners should just seek out on inexpensive used vinyl-- with a jazz record this popular, there are plenty of copies floating around. But the music is so subtle and detailed, surface noise really can get in the way here. Sketches is a masterpiece that opens up with a close listen, with every detail of the music clearly audible. So do seek it out, but if you do so with this edition, it'll cost you a few bucks.","Originally issued in 1960, this was Davis' studio follow-up to the landmark Kind of Blue and found him striking out in an entirely new direction.

The Dreams We Have as Children,Noel Gallagher,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45eb1335d7bf1698939/1:1/w_160/96261c70.jpg,2009-06-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13082-the-dreams-we-have-as-children/,Big Brother,"If you can overlook the past dozen or so years' worth of Oasis' music, Noel Gallagher isn't a bullshit artist. He speaks his mind-- directly, clearly, possibly loudly, and thankfully often. Among his most frequent targets is hypocrisy, which he's often seen in the posturing of artists performing high-profile charitable acts. Hell, his quips about the toothlessness and pointlessness of Live 8 are arguably the most entertaining things he's produced this decade. To wit (no pun): ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but are [Live 8] hoping that one of these guys from the G8 is on a quick 15-minute break at Gleneagles [Scotland] and sees Annie Lennox singing 'Sweet Dreams' and thinks, 'Fuck me, she might have a point there.'"" Gallagher has, of course, done charity work himself, pitching in to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust (and Pablove Foundation, which benefits the cancer-stricken son of Dangerbird Records' Jeff Castelaz), Street Child Africa, Tibetan Freedom, and of course War Child. It was Oasis' contribution to War Child's 1995 Help! album-- a slowed, Johnny Depp-assisted version of B-side ""Fade Away""-- that gives Gallagher's latest charitable effort its name. Dreams We Have as Children is a collection of songs recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in March 2007 at a show again to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust. Bootlegs of most of the show's 16 songs have been around for a while, but in recent months iTunes has begun selling the full set to benefit the TCT. Joined on two songs by Paul Weller and throughout the set by fellow Oasis guitarist Gem Archer, it's not a strictly solo show, but it is primarily acoustic, inviting comparisons to Oasis' notorious 1995 ""MTV Unplugged"" set, where the elder Gallagher had to pinch-hit for his supposedly ill younger brother, Liam. The Oasis frontman watched the performance from a balcony while smoking and drinking as Noel soldiered on, earning a wellspring of respect in the process and helping to dispel the notions that both of the oft-quarreling siblings were unprofessional. Dreams also recalls that set in another way-- of the 13 Oasis songs here, 11 date from 1994-95, by far the most artistically fruitful years in the band's history. (The two exceptions are ""Don't Go Away"", from 1997's Be Here Now, and ""The Importance of Being Idle"", from 2005's Don't Believe the Truth.) The requisite big songs are mostly here-- ""Wonderwall"", ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", ""Slide Away"", three of Oasis' best-- but, intriguingly, other than those, ""Cast No Shadow"", and ""Married With Children"", the set features six songs originally recorded as either B-sides or LP bonus tracks, making the night a treat for diehard fans and giving a larger variety of would-be buyers reasons to check out the record. Of the B-sides, the deeper into Oasis' catalogue they go, the more of a mixed bag they are here. ""Listen Up"", when stripped of its shoegaze-biting sheen, holds up better than expected, thanks in part to Noel's more varied line readings compared to his brother's bluster. Opener ""(It's Good) To Be Free"", one of Oasis' weaker 94-95 efforts to start, is a slog here as well. The song that follows, ""Talk Tonight"", shouldn't have picked things up either. One of the band's more poignant tracks, it was originally recorded as a solo acoustic effort by an audibly exhausted and frustrated Noel. Estranged from the group and considering disbanding it, it's arguably his most human performance and a reason why its parent EP, Some Might Say, is his band's most compelling, top to bottom. Taken out of that context, the song still holds up nicely. As does ""Half the World Away"", made famous in the UK as the theme song to ""The Royle Family"" and here turned into an audience sing-along, and ""Fade Away"", the song which gives the LP its title and still one of Oasis' high points. Not that they likely minded, but the audience was rewarded for sitting through mostly B-sides with a brief two-song guest spot by Paul Weller, in which he and Noel performed one of the Jam's best B-sides, ""The Butterfly Collector"", and the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love"". A thrill in the room I'm sure, but it all feels sort of rote and almost expected from a Noel Gallagher set rather than a nice surprise. It doesn't help that the usually simmering and bitter ""Butterfly"" is flat and the Beatles song is, you know, ""All You Need Is Love"". From there, Noel mostly rolled out the hits, all sounding fine, and an awkward cover of the Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", whose fatalist, adolescent-appealing romanticism seems to both befuddle Gallagher and make for an awkward fit on a album recorded and released to prevent teenagers from dying. Ending with that and the jaunty ""Married With Children"", it's clear that the songs picked here have no specific message to impart or connection to the charity at hand, which is just as well. For Gallagher to suddenly play off as if they did, he'd risk being the hypocritical superstar he so clearly loathes. That he instead took the occasion to spotlight a slightly lesser-known part of his career elevates this set above a standard charity effort; that he focused on the first two years of his career elevates it above most of the other Oasis records this decade.","A recording of a 2007 charity show finds Gallagher revisiting many classics from Oasis' most fruitful years and includes guest spots from Paul Weller.

Hombre Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire,Eels,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4635e6ef95969320873/1:1/w_160/7eda6609.jpg,2009-06-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13087-hombre-lobo-12-songs-of-desire/,Vagrant,"The central metaphor of 2005'sÂ ""Railroad Man""Â worked harder than a steam engine to convey the idea that Mark Everett (aka E, for all intents and purposes, Eels) just wasn't made for these times. I call bullshit: Considering Everett's prolific nature, restless manner with aliases, and disdain of the music industry, you'd figure the internet age would result in an outpouring of more Eels material than ever before. So how is the 40-minutes-and-change Hombre Lobo, Eels'Â first collection of new songs in four years? Could be that Blinking Lights and Other Revelations was something of a career ender. This isn't to be confused with a career killer; on the contrary, Blinking Lights was the best Eels record since 1998'sÂ Electro-Shock Blues. But it's a record that would be tough to top if only because it felt unnecessary to follow up, serving as a comprehensive Guide to All Things Eels, E's lyrical and musical themes attacked from every angle. At second glance though,Â Blinking Lights' consistency was borne out of similarity. It's incredibly easy to write an Eels song these days: pick a descending chord progression, force some rhymes on the title, and you're on your way. Perhaps you'll be more excited about making an Eels record than E seems here, as he scribbles through theÂ 12 Songs of Desire like they were moderately difficult crosswords. From what I could tell, Hombre Lobo wasn't supposed to end up that way. Considering the title, it set out to tap into man's more primal needs, but emotionally and musically, E's pretty much been going it alone since the jump. Opener ""Prizefighter""Â initially recalls Souljacker's hairy-knuckle-draggingÂ ""Dogfaced Boy"",Â the song that ushered in Everett's Unabomber look and undisputedly his weakest stretch of music. In between blues explosion howling, it gives you headslap titular rhymes likeÂ ""go all-nighter""Â andÂ ""don't do it wrong, do-it-righter."" And whileÂ ""Tremendous Dynamite""Â andÂ ""What's a Fella Gotta Do""Â sorta rock, they rock pretty hard for Eels songs, but I can't imagine that Hombre Lobo is going to be anyone's primary source for hot riffs, not when E is still deadpanning his way through lyrics like, ""You really know what makes me sad/ Your disinterest is driving me mad,""Â and, ""I'm so tired of the same old crud/ My sweet baby, I need fresh blood."" The tracks on Hombre Lobo that aren'tÂ juke-joint pastiche sink into Everett's comfort zone of impotent longing, the trouble with dreams, and the general shittiness of putting your faith in other people. As someone who's been following him for damn near a decade and a half, there's still enough suction in Everett's seemingly bottomless vortex of self-pity. Like most of E's best songs,Â ""The Look You Give That Guy""Â turns an unrequited crush into an intense self-loathing-- the key isn't that the object of his desire would be better off with him, but his simple wish thatÂ ""if I were that guy instead of me, I'd never let you down."" But I wonder if the success ofÂ ""The Look""Â is more due to its sequencing, since similarly themed and composed tracks down the line such asÂ ""The Longing""Â andÂ ""In My Dreams""Â fail to deliver any sort of lasting effect, ultimately coming off like E could spend the rest of his life writing variations ofÂ ""Ugly Love"". But while it's somewhat hopeless to think E could write about something other than hopelessness, Hombre continues his misguided decision to let his lyrics take the forefront over frail and unencumbered arrangements.Â ""Beginner's Luck""Â andÂ ""Fresh Blood""Â both approach R&B cautiously, the former copping a bouncy Motown vibe while the latter almost recalls the heavily sampledÂ ""Message From a Black Man"".Â Yet each is treated with the same dry, flat band-in-a-box recording that, once again, reminds me how long it's been since I've listened to Chocolate and Cheese. It would be too easy to dog Hombre Lobo as a case where going back to the well leads to diminishing returns, but the problem is just that Hombre Lobo is too easy. For all the emotional polarity E hopes to convey, too much of Hombre sports the facility of a jingle-- the contours of the lyrics and music so predetermined that Everett could just as easily be singing about free credit reports. Granted, E's arguably catering only to people who were stuck off the realness of Electro-Shock Blues to the point where they managed to get to Blinking Lights, but as an intermittently proud member of that group, I'll admit that Hombre Lobo feels like an appendix to a predecessor that hardly needed more of the same.","Juke-joint pastiche and songs about hopelessness-- hey, it's the latest Eels record.

Spirit Animal,Zombi,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4329d034d5c69bf2fe3/1:1/w_160/7e401d66.jpg,2009-06-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13046-spirit-animal/,Relapse,"Zombi(e)s? Badass. One peeved-looking elephant brandishing its tusks towards your fleshy bits as it stampedes through the space-fog? Mega badass. Monolithic, lazer-show ready instrumental prog rawk? Well, that can pass or play, but in combination with the aforementioned twofer, you'd probably go with ""badass"" again, huh? You'd think! When the mood strikes, few bands do bong-rips-in-your-Dodge-Dart badass quite like Pittsburgh's Zombi. The sound Steve Moore and Anthony Paterra make-- equal parts Italo-funkers Goblin, Can's lockstep whirl, intro music to educational filmstrips of the 1970s, and Edgar Winter's undead ""Frankenstein""-- can be almost impossibly epic. When it works, as it did over and over again on 2006's Surface to Air, it feels like a vision quest through the bowels of hell. But whereas Surface found myriad ways to match looming dread with body-rocking thunder (they are on Relapse, after all), Spirit Animal plays the extremes. The heights can be towering, the lows crushing, but the relative lack of middle ground keeps Spirit Animal off balance and a few shades shy of truly badass. Instrumental rock of this sort requires a certain ratio of tension and release; the tunes range in length from a lean six minutes and change to the comfortably numbing 17-plus minutes of closer ""Through Time"", and too much time spent at either end of the spectrum can be stultifying when you get into the lengthier numbers. Often Spirit Animal gets so caught up in its own grooves it almost seems to forget there's anybody listening; where a constant dynamism bubbled under the comparably hefty Surface to Air, Spirit Anim**al too often finds Zombi settling into one mode or the other-- spacey, or spooky, but mostly skull-smashing-- and letting it ride just a touch too long. Individual moments can crush or creep, but far too many riffs get turned every which way but out, and far too few of those are quite badass enough to justify the time they spend with 'em. Spirit Animal is almost certainly the band's loudest effort; half-Zombi Steve Moore even sneaks a little electric guitar in there, a first for the band on wax. If you'd told me either of those things before I heard the record, I would've pegged it as their best based on that alone; it's not that Zombi really needed to get louder or introduce new elements into the mix, but that'd certainly be a direction you'd think they'd revel in. They do, but as a listener, it's hard not to feel bludgeoned by the oft-endless riffage that characterizes much of Spirit Animal. Given their relatively small arsenal of instruments and an apparent unwillingness to shed the ghosts of their influences, I suppose there's only so many things they can do without going way way out, and Spirit Animal finds them doing just that. But unlike Surface to Air-- or even the terrific ""Infinity"" from their recent split with Maserati-- the sprawl becomes a crawl, and the rift between the parts that kick your butt and the parts that get you primed for said butt kicking is just a bit too great for Spirit Animal to achieve the kind of balance Zombi have been so adept at in the past. In the end, Spirit Animal becomes less like the badass elephant on its front and more like just another pachyderm; heavy, yes, but lumbering.","Badass instrumental rock group followÂ 2006's outstandingÂ Surface to Air, a record that matchedÂ looming dread with body-rocking thunder.

Two Fingers,Two Fingers,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45f5e6ef95969320866/1:1/w_160/b589da93.jpg,2009-06-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13083-two-fingers/,Paper Bag,"Amon Tobin, Timbaland disciple! Who would've thought? The last time I paid any attention to this Ninja Tune fixture, he was making music for video games, which seemed like a pretty good reason to stop paying attention. Now he's teamed up with the British drum and bass producer Doubleclick to make a quick little album of apocalyptic slash-and-burn rap futurism, with 1999-vintage Timbo as their spirit animal and an actual one-time Tim protÃ©gÃ© on board for a couple of tracks. So yeah, now they've got my attention. It's going to be impossible to talk about Two Fingers without talking about Tim Mosley, since most of the album's good ideas are good ideas that Tim had years ago: off-kilter stop-start drums, chopped-up shards of Eastern instrumentation, oceans of negative space. And Tobin and Doubleclick can't quite do this stuff as well as Tim once could. But honestly, all that is fine, as Tim isn't really working this style ever since he decided to go full-on cheeseball Euro-dance, and anyway, the armies of post-Tim rap producers are a long, long way away from mining all the gold he put out there between 1997 and 2001. So when the album opens with the eerie clinking drums and backwards otherworldly guitar loop of ""Straw Men"", it's a weird nostalgic rush, like finding an old sci-fi pulp novel and marveling about how its visions of the future were so much cooler than how the future actually turned out. It helps that the British rapper Sway, who guests on this song and plenty more, absolutely murders the thing, never saying much or leaving much of a personality imprint but showing absolute mastery of a very particular breakneck technical style, one that works great for complimenting the oozing atmosphere around him. Sway guests on seven of the album's tracks, and his participation is a mixed blessing. He was never a grime rapper, whatever that meant, and his staunch devotion to technical dexterity always stood in stark contrast to that scene's screaming chaos. Here, he sounds best talking blasted-earth Armageddon, like when he talks about the time he met some Brazilian gang types on ""What You Know"": ""The difference between them Gs and we/ Is they fighting for peace while we fight for a piece."" He seethes beautifully. But on an album that aims for dark cohesion as much as this one, I can't fathom why he'd devote two songs to relationship-rap or another, ""Jewels and Gems"", to sub-Canibus bits of forehead-slapping wisdom. For instance: ""You can't describe pictures without the words."" (This is his reason for believing that a picture is not, in fact, worth a thousand words.) Or: ""There's no evil in money; the evil's in the greed."" Don't think too hard there, buddy. Former Timbaland mainstay Ms. Jade, who released a couple of great singles and a pretty good album in 2002 before disappearing completely, shows up for a couple of tracks, and it's great to hear that she can still wreck a track, even if she is saddled with substandard hooks. Dancehall siren Ce'cile also drops in for a track, her effortless, breezy cool nicely offsetting the heaviness erupting all around her. But Two Fingers really works best when it fades into a vaguely forbidding background throb. Sway, after all, is the sort of rapper who sounds best when you're not paying all that much attention to him, and there's a nice overhanging ominousness throughout the album. The brisk 40-minute run time keeps things from getting too oppressive or monochromatic. The tracks keep subtly shifting throughout, just enough to keep you interested without overwhelming you. Every once in a while, Tobin and Doubleclick pull out a great little trick like the moment on ""High Life"" where they distort Sway's voice so severely that it actually dissolves into clicks and beeps. The whole record is a smart little left-turn for everyone involved. And if it's not quite an unalloyed triumph, I would totally play a video game with this soundtrack.","Amon Tobin hooks up with producer Doubleclick and MC Sway for a satisfying album of brooding, atmospheric beat science.

Tyvek,Tyvek,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a458b1335d7bf169892b/1:1/w_160/89069149.jpg,2009-06-04 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13076-tyvek/,Siltbreeze,"Just more than a year ago, MTV News' John Norris put together a short segment on lo-fi indie rock: It was hot. It was fresh. It was what the kids were getting into months before they were skewering Wavves on message boards. There were interviews with Times New Viking, No Age, and Jay Reatard. Somewhere in the shuffle were Tyvek, a goofy Detroit five-piece that, despite a ""Buzzworthy"" nod, seems to have stayed relatively subterranean. And if their posture, stage presence, or frontguy Kevin Boyer's on-camera quip (""You can buy our sound at Guitar Center"") were any kind of indicator, they probably couldn't give less of a fuck. But you know, not in a Black Lips sort of way. Big surprise then, that the band's debut full-length doesn't sound as though it's mangling your speakers. Coming to us via Siltbreeze-- a label whose releases have nearly always sounded as though they were recorded on speakerphone through curtains of snot-- the songs on Tyvek are relatively clean. They should be also familiar to anyone that had a chance to see them live in the past 18 months, as many of songs here were included on CD-Rs pressed for touring. And though cowlicks still pop up throughout, they rarely detract from the character or integrity of the songs and album as a whole. One of the only moments when sloppy doesn't seem to fit, opener ""Circular Ruins"" is a clenched, vein-y psych number that seems to substitute banging for just letting go. Burners like ""Summer Things"" and the crispy ""Hey Una"" balance that equation, grafting layers of Feelies-inflected guitar melody onto runaway frameworks. Those same guitars detonate in the record's dangerous middle section, the cola rush of ""Frustration Rock"" and twin squiggles of ""Stand and Fight""-- two standouts that really enjoy the bump in fidelity. As means for cooling down, the same Mexican-tinged track with rotating titles (""Sonora"", ""Tecate"", ""El Centro"", and ""Mexicali"") offers brief interludes/beer breaks between the louder jams. It sounds like rehearsal noise from three rooms away, and if pressed, one might call it lazy. But it works, and if it didn't precede the near six minutes of flyover noise and Motor City malaise that is pseudo-closer ""What To Do"", I might long for it. But the Big Kahuna is ""Building Burning (Re-Edit)"", a herky-jerk garage epic that, in a series of movements, meets its title halfway. Amps smoke. The bass bubbles up and pops. Boyer loses the dry warble and his shit behind the microphone, using up all his spit and juice by the time he's done. In a way, it exemplifies what's most fascinating about Tyvek and Tyvek. Here they steamroll their budget and continue imbuing their pop music with a menace that feels like it was already built-in. So often, that song in particular feels like it's about to overheat and come apart at its hinges. But it never does.","Siltbreeze band offers what, for that lo-fi label, is a relatively clean record, with standouts held over from tour CD-Rs that enjoy their bump in fidelity.

"The Singles, Vol. 7: 1970-1972",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4675e6ef9596932087d/1:1/w_160/532df5e4.jpg,2009-06-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13091-the-singles-vol-7-1970-1972/,Hip-O Select,"On March 9, 1970, James Brown's band blew up, and it was arguably the best thing that ever happened to him. Hours before a show in Columbus, Georgia, they threatened to quit unless they got better pay and better treatment; Soul Brother #1 fired them and flew in the Pacemakers, a bunch of teenagers from Cincinnati who knew his songs as well as any other funk band in those days. In fact, they were the first band he'd played with who'd grown up on funk, and they included a pair of world-class musicians-- guitarist Phelps ""Catfish"" Collins and his bassist brother William ""Bootsy"" Collins. For the next year, Brown's flame burned even hotter than it ever had before or would again. The string of classic singles that band recorded are all included here, beginning with ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"". Banged out in two takes in a late-night studio visit a mere six weeks after that Columbus gig, it's a funk firebomb that would've defined anyone else's career and was just another hit for Brown. Within the year, they also cut ""Super Bad"" (whose squalling, free-jazz-inspired sax solo by Robert McCullough seemed unthinkable as part of a dance record until JB pulled it off), ""Soul Power"", ""Talking Loud and Saying Nothing"" and a hurtling, screaming freakout called ""Get Up, Get Into It, and Get Involved"", all of them massive hits. By this point, Brown had mostly abandoned songs-as-we-know-them, although he did release a ballad called ""I Cried"" that he'd written for Tammy Montgomery in the early 60s, as well as a duet with Lyn Collins on his own oldie ""Just Won't Do Right"". The new band's formula was single-chord riffs (and maybe a bridge on the subdominant), fantastically tricky grids of rhythms and horns, and a couple of hook phrases, sometimes traded with former Famous Flame Bobby Byrd (that's him yelling the ""get on up"" part of ""Sex Machine""). That's all they needed. Brown had always thrived on the spontaneity of his live show, and his new style let him fly as freely on record as he did on stage. Almost all of his early-70s hits have moments that give off the heat of creation in the instant. The loping hard-funk version of ""Talking Loud and Saying Nothing"" features JB yelling to engineer Ron Lenhoff to ""keep the tape running"" as he decides in the middle of the take to add its spectacular a cappella breakdown. ""Escape-Ism"" wasn't even a composition before it was a recording-- it was a warmup jam that Lenhoff thought to record (with another new lineup, which had at that point been together for barely two weeks under the direction of trombonist Fred Wesley), and it went Top 10 on the R&B charts. The new crop of musicians who joined up in early 1971 weren't nearly as virtuosic as the Collins brothers (memorable quote from the liner notes, on ""Make It Funky"": ""Second guitarist Robert Coleman deserves a nod for sticking with his humble three notes and staying out of the way""). Fortunately, Wesley was a brilliant bandleader who knew how to make a lot out of a little. ""Hot Pants"", the four-part ""Make It Funky"" (released as two consecutive singles), and ""I'm a Greedy Man"" are all juggernaut dance records that turn out, on inspection, to be constructed out of fairly simple components. As with every volume of this mail-order-only series, Brown's lapses in taste are revealed a few times, although there aren't many on this set-- a pair of ludicrous Christmas singles and an instrumental cover of Blood, Sweat & Tears' ""Spinning Wheel"". Also, Hip-O's completist approach to including every alternate mix that hit airwaves or stores, as well as Brown's habit of splitting songs over 45 sides, means that we get multiple consecutive versions of a lot of titles: the two discs' 39 tracks represent 15 songs (and a funny/sad anti-drug PSA). But it's hard to object to hearing ""Soul Power"" or ""Sex Machine"" a few times in a row.","This set finds James Brown putting together a new band, mostly abandoningÂ songs-as-we-know-them, and generally kicking ass.

Blood,Franz Ferdinand,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4625e6ef9596932086e/1:1/w_160/be0407da.jpg,2009-06-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13086-blood/,Domino,"Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos' vocals are often wry snapshots of hedonistic nights spent with mysterious, mercurial women. It's an example, perhaps, of a globetrotting pop star singing about what he knows (his food writing doesn't translate into three-minute singles quite as well). But the band isn't nearly as risky, uninhibited, and freewheeling when it comes to its own music. The group's sophomore album sounded like a heavyweight repressing from the same post-punk revival mold used to make its debut, and the recent Tonight came off as a tease, flirting with synthesizers and a few new directions, not to mention a rotating cast of producers. Though, to its credit, the band endured numerous false starts in an attempt to get it right-- the making-of saga even boasts a human bone-as-percussion studio story-- Tonight hinted at opportunity without fully seizing it. Blood, an album-length dub version of Tonight, arrives as an experimental spin on the band's music at a time when they're already toying with their formula. Though it was previously included as part of a deluxe box set and released in limited quantities for Record Store Day, Blood isn't merely a collectible or curiosity. Described as ""Franz through Dan's filter""-- a reference to producer Dan Carey, the former Mad Professor apprentice who was the last person to fill the producer's chair during the making of Tonight-- it's filled with relaxed recalibrations of the source material. While groups like Easy Star have made a cottage industry out of recording new dub covers, Blood goes the traditional route by rearranging and remixing elements of the original music. Carey may have spent time recently working with Lily Allen and Kylie, but he hasn't lost his feel for reggae. ""Feel the Envy"", which unspools the slippery bass line and bubbling synths of ""Send Him Away"" and submerges the song in reverberations, and ""Feeling Kind of Anxious"", where Kapranos' words cycle and careen off the walls of an echo chamber, are prime examples. ""Backwards on My Face"", a slack remix of ""Twilight Omens"", wallows in a low groove, springy but crisp snare beats, and vocoded croaks that used to be Kapranos' lyrics. Many of the album's best moments recast parts of the original songs in ways that underline their melodic strength, especially the bass lines of Bob Hardy. ""Katherine Hit Me"", a reworking of ""No You Girls"", glides by on the original track's tight, funky bass line, a solid frame that stands up to the shift towards a half-time tempo and meandering effects. Carey's work calls to mind Echo Dek, Adrian Sherwood's deft reworking of the master tapes of Primal Scream's Vanishing Point, including the slightly darker, paranoid bent. Despite the album's anxiety-prone songs titles, Franz sound relaxed and just as cocksure on these remixes, rarely forced. While the songs are well-constructed, Blood is intriguing to a certain point but lacking the jolt necessary to transcend the concept. Perhaps that's putting unfair expectation on what is a well-executed one-off exercise, but some tracks feel a bit winded-down as opposed to re-imagined. For every channel-shifting echo effect on the album, there are moments, like the pulsating synths on ""Die on the Floor"" or stretches where Kapranos' vocals are looped, that call to mind standard dance remixes, standard being the key word. It's arguable how ""dub"" a few of these tracks are-- much like Tonight, they don't fully commit. Franz's music is usually as crisp and tight as its constructivist cover art, and though reformatted, stretched out, and slowed down on Blood, it still maintains a strong pulse. Hopefully this playful detour leads to more easygoing experimentation when Franz Ferdinand start cracking skulls together for the next full length.","The Scots offer an album-length dub version of their latest albumÂ Tonight created by former Mad Professor apprentice Dan Carey.

Odo Sanbra,Occidental Brothers Dance Band International,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c613d1975652138db5/1:1/w_160/1612eeec.jpg,2009-06-03 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13170-odo-sanbra/,self-released,"""International"" is an appellation that hundreds, or perhaps even thousands, of West African bands attached to the end of their names in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, not because their members were sourced from multiple countries (they usually weren't), but to express to potential audiences how broad the appeal of the music was. In the case of Chicago-based highlife revivalists Occidental Brothers Dance Band International, the International carries both meanings. This is music with the potential to appeal to many types of listeners, and the band spans not only borders but the Atlantic Ocean, with members from the United States and Ghana. Former British colonies Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria have long histories of highlife music, beginning with the acoustic palmwine sounds of coastal towns and progressing to big dance bands and ultimately the guitar bands of the last 40 years and the recent rise the hiplife rap/highlife hybrid. It's the guitar band and palmwine periods that OBDBI draw much of their inspiration from, with a dash of jazz for good measure. Founder/guitarist Nathaniel Braddock met vocalist/trumpeter Kofi Cromwell and percussionist Daniel ""Rambo"" Asamoah on a trip to Ghana. The pair spent much of the 80s playing in the highlife band Western Diamonds in their homeland, and Cromwell wings in English, Fante, and Twi on Odo Sanbra. The mix the band cooks up is as intoxicating as the palmwine that lent the original music its name, and the group closes with a version of the standard ""Yaa Amponsah"", done in a spry but laid-back arrangement led by Braddock's snaking acoustic guitar (to hear a brilliant 1928 recording of the song, check out Heritage's Kumasi Trio compilation). Another instrumental, ""Masanga"", is an album highlight, featuring a gorgeous duet between sax player Greg Ward and guest violinist Andrew Bird over cyclical acoustic guitar figures and just enough percussion to outline the beat. Ward's sax is something to behold-- in tandem with Cromwell, he plays the kind of stabbing accents that give this music its extra push, but he also weaves in some outstanding counterpoint to Braddock, taking the role that would normally be occupied by a second guitar on the title track, which translates to ""Come Back, Love"". ""Circle Circle Circle"", a song about chaotic traffic in Accra, Ghana's capitol city, features a gutteral guest vocal from hiplife MC Yao Osufui that provides a stark, machine-gun contrast to Ward's fluid solo over the song's first half. For Westerners looking for an easy foot in the door, a good one might be the band's outstanding cover of New Order's ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", a song whose simple chord structure makes an easy transition to highlife arrangements, with the horns cleverly taking on the original synth parts. On Odo Sanbra, Occidental Brothers Dance Band International earn a place alongside their highlife forebears by doing their own thing with the music and emerging with a sound that pays tribute to the past while moving the form forward. Having two genuine highlife stars in the band certainly helps, but everybody pulls his weight-- Braddock has a true grasp of West African guitar styles, bassist Joshua Ramos gets the bounce and swing of the music, and Ward has a brilliant sense of phrasing and flow. If highlife is going to get the revival it deserves, it could scarcely ask for better ambassadors.","Chicago-based group pays tribute to highlife's past while moving the form forward.

Mind the Drift,Big Business,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43c9d034d5c69bf3001/1:1/w_160/6007fe08.jpg,2009-06-03 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13055-mind-the-drift/,Hydra Head,"Chances are high that if you like the first two records from L.A.-via-Seattle's Big Business, you'll also like the band's third album in four years, Mind the Drift. While that may sound like quintessential question-begging, it's not, as bassist Jared Warren and drummer Coady Willis added guitarist Toshi Kasai before writing and recording much of number three. To these ears, Willis and Warren have always been a pop band that clad great hooks--Â listen forÂ ""Eis Hexe""Â from Head For the Shallow, orÂ ""Grounds for Divorce""Â from Here Come the Waterworks--Â within thick metal plates. They've had fun, too, taking risks with the occasional expansive instrumental track or a hard-charging tune that, without warning, opens wide into synthesizer wizardry and choral vocals. Infinitely likable and accessible but ultimately distinct and identifiable, Big Business have long seemed hard rock's answer to Phoenix. Aside from both having backed more-established acts (Phoenix once backed Air; Mind the Drift is Big Business' second since becoming an official half of the Melvins), both bands take magnetic pop cores and cast them into surprising musical contexts. Phoenix goes for sharp guitars and billowing keyboards. Big Business go for skuzzy bass and busy drums. Mind the Drift seems to be an expansion of that: Willis still viciously circumnavigates his drumkit with authority and adventure. Warren still manhandles a viscous bass tone that he funnels into heavy themes. Kasai adds texture and dimension, augmenting what's there instead of adulterating it. The hooks are still memorable, and the arrangements are still heavy. OnÂ ""The Drift"",Â for instance, bass and guitar are locked into a direct charge, while Willis dances on and around the beat with his cymbals.Â ""You take the east/ And I'll take the west/ If we meet in the middle/ We'll know,""Â barks Warren, his voice handled better than ever before by producer Phil Ek. On singleÂ ""Gold and Final"", Kasai's guitar actually takes the lead, twisting through an anxious, repetitive phrase. He keeps his tone and sound small, though, a juxtaposition that emphasizes the size of the giants--Â bass, guitar, and Warren and Willis'Â countering vocals--Â towering overhead. This album's mid-point weirdness,Â ""I Got It Online"",Â works through a similar spatial effect. Warren anxiously shouts phrases likeÂ ""Too many squares/ Too many cruds/ Too many nerds.""Â His distorted bass and Willis'Â restless drum beating wrestle Kasai's guitar pattern--Â staccato notes nervously scattered through the mix with delay--Â for room. Lyrically and musically, it's an epic battle of nerves. In duo form, the tune would've sounded incomplete. And perhaps that's what some folks have liked about Big Business all along: Where I heard pop possibility turned tough, I suppose others simply heard two guys beating pretty good songs about social anxieties into a heavy metal mess. For some, Kasai's addition has worked as a distraction from that unequivocal beastliness. I reckon those folks will really dislikeÂ ""Theme From Big Business II"",Â a finessed seven-minute metal anthem with an arching guitar line, chimes, and well-placed harmonies that sound a little like Crosby, Stills & Nash gone wild. For the most part, Warren sticks his bass playing to the script, andÂ WillisÂ builds his drum lines through well-considered waves. Kasai, meanwhile, is all over the place, making his guitar mirror a horn before sweeping through a fast cycle of riffs and variations. I think it rules, and I loved Big Business I. Maybe you loved Big Business I, too, but you hate this. That would be too bad.","Third LP in four years-- and second since becoming Melvins' members--Â from the L.A./Seattle group, now a trio with the addition ofÂ guitarist Toshi Kasai.

PrÃ©liminaires,Iggy Pop,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a460ea9e61561daa4ec5/1:1/w_160/d2ebee7d.jpg,2009-06-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13084-preliminaires/,EMI,"It's hard not to root for Iggy Pop. At the very least, his initial tenure with the Stooges earned him more than his share of bricks in the modern rock foundation. Beyond that, his very survival in the face of untold self-destruction merits a few slaps on the back, too, and his first two solo albums, recorded with the help of buddy and benefactor David Bowie, remain classics in their own right. Since then, however, there's hardly been an Iggy Pop record worth listening to more than once, if that, and sadly that includes the unlikely Stooges reunion record, The Weirdness.Â With the untimely passing of Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, that reunion unfortunately becomes a one-off, and sends Iggy back to wandering the wilderness as a solo artist. Of course, given his all-over-the-place career, there's no reason to believe Iggy wouldn't have madeÂ PrÃ©liminaires,Â the follow-up toÂ The Weirdness and the first Iggy Pop solo disc since 2003'sÂ Skull Ring,Â anyway. Still,Â PrÃ©liminaires comes as a sharp left turn:Â Inspired by The Possibility of an Island by blithely provocative French novelist (and occasional filmmaker and musician) Michel Houellebecq,Â PrÃ©liminaires ""comesÂ dangerously near jazz,""Â Pop claims in the press notes, clearly forgetting, like everyone else, that he recorded some of the shittyÂ Avenue B with Medeski, Martin & Wood. But in truthÂ PrÃ©liminaires is less jazz than Iggy Pop as Euro-pop, Ã¡ la Leonard Cohen circaÂ I'm Your Man,Â crooning over a bed of mostly mushy and melancholy electronics and beats. PrÃ©liminaires was recorded largely with collaborator Hal Cragin, who may as well be Hal Wilner for all the satisfaction he takes in tossing Iggy in relatively unfamiliar waters. But Pop makes the most of his new environment to expand his palette and his palate in one fell swoop. Heck, the disc even begins with Iggy mumbling Joseph Kosma and Jacques PrÃ©vert'sÂ ""Les Feuilles Mortes""-- in French!-- ceding the microphone for a swooning smooth sax solo, about the last thing anyone would have expected from him, but yet further proof that the singer is not the dum dum boy people have always made him out to be. Recasting himself as a Gallic crooner isn't necessarily a smart move, granted, but it is audacious, and amidst the drifting ennui Iggy demonstrates his trademark nihilism does translate even distantly removed from his caveman roots.Â ""It's nice to be dead/ It's nice to be underground/ Free of the ugly sounds of life,""Â intones Pop onÂ ""Nice to Be Dead"",Â one of the more memorable tracks on the album, and also one of the few that veers closer to rock than easy listening. The sentiment's a fine epigraph for a singer several lives beyond his allotted nine but clearly comfortable where's he landed late in his career. Plus, even if the music rarely rises to such rousing heights elsewhere, Iggy's lyrical passenger is still clearly riding through the city's backsides, taking notes. Elsewhere Iggy contemplates death by the sea (""Spanish Coast""), covers Jobim (""How Insensitive""), slops out some existential blues (""He's Dead/She's Alive""), and goes faux disco with the blasÃ© irony ofÂ ""Party Time"".Â ""It's party time,""Â he grumbles,Â ""and I smell slime/ The stupid people/ Make me evil.""Â It's a misanthropic sentiment worthy of the Stooges in their prime, but here Iggy sounds beaten, the lyrics revealing his innermost thoughts even as his body goes through the motions. ""Like Daniel, [The Possibility of an Island's] protagonist, I too have grown weary of a career as an entertainer, and I wish for a new life,""Â revealed Iggy Pop in a statement perhaps not out of character for a highly physical (and likely perpetually sore) rock star in his sixties. Weary it (and he) does sound here, beaten, even bored, if not outright boring. But by being boring on purpose, Iggy ironically proves himself oddly more compelling than on his many past accidents. If it's not an album for the ages so much as for the aged, at least it's one you may want to hold on to a bit and give another shot when you get closer to where Iggy's at himself right now.","With the passing of Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, Iggy returns to being a solo artist, issuing an LP he claimsÂ ""comesÂ dangerously near jazz.""

"Secret, Profane and Sugarcane",Elvis Costello,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45ab1335d7bf1698931/1:1/w_160/285a64c7.jpg,2009-06-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13079-secret-profane-and-sugarcane/,Hear Music,"Most of Elvis Costello's records for the past 15 years have been side projects of one kind or another-- attempts to show how very broad his range is that mostly demonstrate the opposite. He's released jazz records, classical records, a soundtrack or two, collaborations with New Orleans R&B overlord Allen Toussaint and mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter. And every few years, at least when he's not threatening to quit recording, he gets together with his actual rock band-- the Attractions or their current iteration, the Imposters-- and does what he's genuinely brilliant at. Secret, Profane and Sugarcane is not one of those rock-band albums. Costello recorded it in Nashville, backed up by an acoustic string-band including Jim Lauderdale, who sings harmonies on most of it, and the estimable dobro player Jerry Douglas. The most promising name in the credits, though, is producer T-Bone Burnett, who worked with Costello on 1986's King of America (as well as a nifty 1985 single credited to the Coward Brothers). King was a focused, fire-spitting album: a seething riposte to American culture and a conflicted love letter to American music. The new record is no King: It's a gummy mishmash, an overambitious collection of table scraps and leftovers. (The forced wordplay of the title is the first sign that it's trying to cover too much ground.) There are remakes of a couple of songs that have been kicking around the Costello repertoire for ages (""Complicated Shadows"" and ""Hidden Shame"", both of which previously turned up on the expanded version of All This Useless Beauty); there are a handful of fussy arias salvaged from a never-finished opera about Hans Christian Andersen and Jenny Lind, and a song dropped from 2004's The Delivery Man. There's a songwriting collaboration with Loretta Lynn, and two more with Burnett. One of the latter, a pastiche of Good Old Boys-era Randy Newman called ""Sulphur to Sugarcane"", is the closest thing to a keeper here (and the song from the album that Costello's been playing live the most), although it'd probably be more striking at three minutes than six. The version of the old Bing Crosby/Patti Page standard ""Changing Partners"" that closes the album is the most sensitive performance on it-- Costello's always had a great ear for covers. It's also a simpler, better-crafted song than any of his originals here. The glory of the Attractions/Imposters is that they can make basically anything in Costello's repertoire sound good--even when the songwriting flags or Elvis oversings, they're fiery and idiomatic enough to keep things interesting. The Sugarcanes, as this album's ensemble will be called when they back Costello on tour this summer, are a fine, subtle, tasteful group, but accompanying this particular frontman occasionally calls for a degree of bluntness or spotlight-hogging they can't supply. When he tries to evoke early Johnny Cash on the remake of ""Hidden Shame"", their boom-chicka-boom lacks snap; when he slows down to a midtempo stroll or torch-song crawl, they don't bother to attempt the Americana-as-critique ferocity of King of America. And when he cranks up his delivery to spit'n'sneer, as on ""My All Time Doll"", they just get railroaded. At its worst, this is effectively a contemporary acoustic neo-No-Depression record with Costello's signature vocal tics slapped on top. It's yet another entry in his string of gestural albums-- another argument that he's not ""just"" the rocker with a rock band whose rock songs still form the backbone of most of his live performances, both in their native idiom and out of it. But whoever suggested that being one of the great rock musicians was something he should aspire to move beyond?","Recorded in Nashville, backed up by an acoustic string-band including Jim Lauderdale, this is sort of a mishmash of ideas, some kicking around for decades.

Grace Around the World,Jeff Buckley,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a459ea9e61561daa4eb5/1:1/w_160/740bc3dc.jpg,2009-06-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13077-grace-around-the-world/,ColumbiaLegacy,"For me, Grace is one of those albums. I remember exactly where I bought it (a long-defunct used-CD store-- remember those?-- on Long Island), what the weather was like that day (windows-rolled-all-the-way-down sunny), and the tingly feeling of discovery while listening to it. A lot of people felt that same way, and when Jeff Buckley died three years after its release, his tragedy only added to what would become a bittersweet obsession. I tore through David Browne's thorough biography, Dream Brother. I bought 2000's stellar live album, Mystery White Boy, the day it came out. I watched the intense Live in Chicago DVD with big eyes. I went to several Jeff Buckley tribute nights in Chicago, where a variety of local talents interpreted their hero's work with sometimes-great, always-reverent covers. I could not get enough of this singer who was equal parts mystic, hippie, romantic, comic, and goofball. And then I got enough. I don't remember exactly when I reached the Buckley threshold. Perhaps during a rom-com trailer that used ""Hallelujah"" a bit too liberally. Or maybe the mystique just turned into frustration and then slowly fizzled into nothingness. But I bet that for every person turned on to Jeff Buckley by the endless stream of rehashes and barrel-scraping releases, there's probably a one-time die hard fan losing their religion. The person who has embarrassingly belted the Live at Sin-Ã© version of ""The Way Young Lovers Do""-- all 10 minutes of it-- while cruising between states doesn't need Grace Around the World. The person who has spent hours listening to My Sweetheart the Drunk and daydreaming about the kind of fucked up and beautiful sophomore album Buckley would have made doesn't need it. And neither does the person completely unfamiliar with Jeff-- there are dozens of superior entry points. I don't need Grace Around the World; you don't need Grace Around the World. Buckley was to be a heritage artist for Columbia, following in the footsteps of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen as a talent who could retain credibility for years, whether or not the public ever came around. When they signed him, they were after credibility and a career with a full catalogue of LPs. At this point, they've got a lengthy Buckley catalogue even though the artist only has one official long-player to his name. This is problematic. Fan loyalty is difficult to cultivate but dead simple to take advantage of. And Grace Around the World is fairly shameless. The press release touts the deluxe 2xDVD/CD version-- featuring TV performances from across the globe circa 1994-95 and the documentary Amazing Grace-- as ""up to 169 minutes of Jeff Buckley footage,"" infomercial style. And this really does seem to be a quantity-not-quality situation. The main DVD showcases every song from Grace (with ""What Will You Say"" swapped in for ""Corpus Christi Carol"", which wasn't played on tour) from television tapings in London, Germany, France, New Orleans, Chicago, and Japan. Since they were being recorded for TV, the audience (if there is an audience) ostensibly isn't filled with Buckley devotees. Perhaps that's one of the reasons many of the songs are not just rote but sort of flat-- a stark contrast to the raucous Live in Chicago DVD, which showcased an entire gig, between-song banter and all. Around the World attempts to add some personality to the cobbled-together footage with snippets of an interview cut between tracks, but the ditsy host asking questions brings out Buckley's sometimes-noxious pretentious side and little else. Made up for the camera and looking tired at best (stiff at worst), few of these performances show Buckley at his prime. The undoubted highlight-- a sweaty, epic take on ""Lover You Should've Come Over""-- is also the only previously released portion of the main program. Meanwhile, the hour-long, 2004 documentary included in the deluxe version of the set, Amazing Grace, is well-intentioned but shoddy. The cheap doc heavily relies on old EPK footage and generally vapid talking-head commentary from everyone from Sebastian Bach to Duncan Sheik to a random classical composer inspired by Grace. And while the whole package is marketed as a ""love letter"" to fans, true followers will quickly be able to sniff out its inferiorities. If anything, this latest selection from the dwindling Buckley vaults subverts his talents and ultimately insults the same hardcore fans it's aimed at.","Yet another Jeff Buckley excavation, this one more quantity than quality.

Here Anonymous,Eulogies,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a437ea9e61561daa4e60/1:1/w_160/d76b230f.jpg,2009-06-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13050-here-anonymous/,Dangerbird,"Eulogies' self-titled 2007 debut used that dour word as a self-fulfilling prophecy, allowing the band to muse and mope about terminated relationships. The band's follow-up, Here Anonymous-- again with the predictive title-- takes more or less the same approach, with a set of 12 songs that stick safely in the pocket of soft-spoken, dude-driven American indie pop. Take ""Day to Day"", which kicks Anonymous off appropriately, and cautiously: ""I left home, and I went out on my own."" Man, if Peter Walker's songwriting turns out to be a serial, we'll have to wait until 2013 for the Toothpaste in Her Medicine Cabinet EP. For now, however, we've got another album that leans toward the ruminative end of the emotional spectrum, but one also packed with punchy moments and crisp songwriting. And who's that? A lady? Yup, on ""Two Can Play"", Walker gets up the nerve to talk to a girl, so to speak. He and Silversun Pickups' Nikki Monninger-- whose little-girlish voice is the perfect complement to Walker's cardigan-soft timbre, if you like very, very delicate things-- finish each others' sentences. When they harmonize on the chorus, they agree on the best way to resolve, not dissolve, a relationship, getting in a little jab at the same time: ""I implore you, talk to me now/ 'Cause you're wrong to hide it."" It's a unique song for Eulogies because there's a girl on it, but it's more singular because it directly poses an answer to a problem, without equivocating. Anonymous has plenty of moments with a pedagogical bent, but Walker's main pupil, as on the band's debut, is himself. The music sounds most energetic, unsurprisingly, when Walker's trying to convince himself, or us, or a woman, that he's going to be okay, or ""find my feet and walk away from here,"" as he promises in ""Bad Connection"". ""Eyes on the Prize"" rocks out to the extent that Eulogies will allow-- on Spinal Tap's amp, they'd register about a 4-- and along with ""Day to Day"", the album opens on an optimistic note, if not one with the familiar scent of a series of TMI Facebook status updates. You get the feeling that if he'd just stick to his guns and not water down his sentiments, he'd start getting somewhere: ""I just wanna see your eyes,"" he pleads on ""Out of Character"", which befits the song's vaguely Interpol-esque vibe. Then, a passive apology: ""Sorry that we let it slip away."" Active voice! On most of Anonymous, he just sounds exhausted and unwilling to follow his own advice, if that's what it is. Despite its initially jaunty guitar tone and optimistic title, ""This Fine Progression"" is cloaked in self-loathing, Walker knowing in advance how he's going to respond to a recurrent situation, and realizing that he's helpless to stop it all the same. Even ""How to Be Alone"", a manual that, if it exists, I think a few of those reading this review would like to flip through from time to time, culminates with Walker admitting (within the album's best hook, it should be noted) that, well, he'd like to read it, too. If you have it to borrow. While I was probably expecting more from Anonymous than I got from it, I'm not disappointed. And while Eulogies seem to have the capacity to do more than the limited playbook they've shown thus far, it's also true that advising the band to strike out in one direction or the other, musically or texturally-- listen to ""Progression"", then listen to Grizzly Bear's ""Two Weeks"", for one example of a similar aura done more effectively-- would be recommending they abandon just what makes them unique. They showed up, sure, but they'd rather you not come over and say hello, if that's okay.","Sophomore album from L.A.-based band explores the ins and outs of relationships over a moody backing; Silversun Pickups' Nikki Monninger guests.

Two,Miss Kittin & the Hacker,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a457ea9e61561daa4eac/1:1/w_160/7aa580cb.jpg,2009-06-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13075-two/,Nobody's Bizzness,"Though she was working prior to this, it's safe to say Miss Kittin's career truly began with 2000's ""Frank Sinatra"". As career highlights go, never mind first bows, it's a pretty enviable one-- over the Hacker's brilliantly stupid rinky-dink ur-techno backdrop, Caroline HervÃ© speak-sings self-absorbed bon mots like ""To be famous is so nice/ Suck my dick/ Kiss my ass,"" over and over with a dispassionate cadence. Miss Kittin's aloof sex-on-ice charisma, paired with synthesized tunes that exploited that detachment (""Stripper"" and ""Life on MTV"" proving you can judge a book by its cover), made First Album a trailblazer for that like-it-or-lump-it music movement known as electroclash. So now, nearly a decade later, in a year that sees electroclash standard-bearers Fischerspooner and Peaches also release new albums, Miss Kittin & the Hacker reconvene for their purported follow-up to that debut, conveniently titled Two. Of course, there are some things to keep in mind when trying to paint this ""reunion"" as just that-- this isn't the first time Kittin & the Hacker have worked together since First Album (with the Hacker contributing beats to I Com and Batbox), and the Miss Kittin from the turn of the century isn't the same as the turn-of-the-decade version. Just look at some of the song titles from Two-- ""The Womb"", ""Emotional Interlude"", ""Inutile ÃternitÃ©"" (French for ""useless eternity""), ""Suspicious Minds"". And, yes, that's Elvis Presley's ""Suspicious Minds"" that the duo is tackling, and they're doing it in a straight-faced manner. Now given the ways and means of Kittin & the Hacker, ""straight-faced"" might not be the best description for this cover, but if it's possible to do a techno'd version of ""Suspicious Minds"" straight, then by gum they're doing it as well as they can. Which is to say, not very well at all, unless you're partial to Eurodisco karaoke. Accouterments aside, the distance between Sinatra and Presley-- as heartthrob icons, pop music iconoclasts, or Vegas showmen-- is probably minuscule. But the distance between the cultured self-aware cool of ""Frank Sinatra"" (or First Album as a whole) and the oblivious earnestness of ""Suspicious Minds"" could be measured in light years. It's a distance that's only accentuated by this record's superficial attempt to hearken back to the duo's glory days. But folks that kept up with Kittin's post-First output already know about the conflict between what she does best (the cooler-than-you kiss-off) and what she seemingly wants to be. On Two, only ""PPPO"" sidesteps that tar pit, mostly because Kittin's vocal input is limited to shouting four words-- ""people,"" ""pleasure,"" ""objects,"" and ""power""-- every so often. That the tune also features the Hacker's best block-rocking beat of the album doesn't hurt. But the Hacker's workmanlike production here can't save Kittin from herself. When she's given room to speak her mind, as on ""The Womb"" (""I am strong, and I'm climbing the social ladder on my own"") or ""Party in My Head"" (""I'm so small, I'm so not individual""), she sounds like she's trying to convince herself that she's one of the little people she once enjoyed stepping on. In tracks like ""Ray Ban"" and ""Indulgence"", she makes a vain attempts to reconnect to the glitz and gaudiness of First Album-era Kittin, and sounds even more out-of-step as a result. And only die-hard Kittin fans (or folks with a severe allergy to melisma and other diva signifiers) will find anything of substance to enjoy in ""1000 Dreams"" or ""Electronic City"". As the next step in Kittin's conflicted evolution, Two is not that much different from (or more enjoyable than) what's preceded it. As a supposed remembrance of the heyday of electroclash, it's a nostalgia trip that's best left untaken.","A sequel of sorts to the pair's 2001 First Album shows how much has changed since electroclash's heyday.

Divisionals,Mouthus,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44e9d034d5c69bf302e/1:1/w_160/a551ea80.jpg,2009-06-02 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13068-divisionals/,Ecstatic Peace,"Mouthus are professionals. Not that their music is a full-time job, or is made out of obligation. Rather, Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson approach every recording seriously and diligently, never bending their methods to fit expectations or pander to an audience. Often this devout methodology produces a glorious alchemy; other times it results in workmanlike exercises in sound excavation. But every Mouthus album comes with an implicit seal of quality craftsmanship. You may not find an epiphany in each listen, but you'll never come away feeling shortchanged. Divisionals might be Mouthus' most workmanlike effort to date. It consists of four equally thoughtful tracks, each dutifully exploring a simple idea. If the album lacks the sonic variety or magical moments found on classics like 2005's Slow Globes and 2007's Saw a Halo, it at least gives each chosen concept its complete due. It's as if Sullivan and Nelson decided to hole up in a lab and mix their basic elements in minimal combinations, until each fully interacted and dissolved. Those elements remain flexible and strong. We get heavy doses of guitar drones and feedback loops from Sullivan, hypnotic clangs from Nelson's hybrid electro-acoustic drums, and something resembling vocals buried deep below. It's all wrapped in the duo's trademark combo of robotic repetition, microscopic precision, and messy, organic growth. The overall effect is like that of a metallic flower blooming into a statue and slowly rusting before your eyes. Opener ""The Duration Myth"" sets an eerie tone, with moaning echoes and rattling percussion feeling like a faded film of an abandoned merry-go-round. The track slowly morphs into a free-rock jam, which Mouthus then hard cut into the backwards-loping groove of ""Rotary Sends"", sounding like the Dead C in a medieval dungeon. Side Two brightens things a bit-- ""In the Erase"" adds a lilting, flute-like tone to the roaring loops, while ""Telescoped Histories"" turns a march of buzzing bees into a bleeping video game. To me-- a Mouthus lifer who was hooked the first time I heard their debut on a car radio courtesy of Princeton's WPRB-- all of this metronomic, heavily-textured sound offers little to complain about, and a lot to love. To the casual fan (hard to imagine, but I'm sure there are some out there), the album might sound solid but not particularly memorable-- a nice little step on a career path that has hit higher highs before and undoubtedly will do so again. But for anyone with ears, Divisionals is clearly another honest day's work from a band that always shows up on time.","Brooklyn-based duo returns with an album that doesn't quite match 2007's Saw a Halo but still shows their way with barbed, heavily textured sound.

Jay Stay Paid,J Dilla,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b25e6ef9596932091c/1:1/w_160/6e6af3b4.jpg,2009-06-02 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13152-jay-stay-paid/,Nature Sounds,"Dilla will always be with us. I don't mean that in just the spiritual sense, or in the way that people are going to be feeling his legacy for a while, though god knows I must've reviewed a dozen albums over the past year that were either in tribute to him or featured some of his beats or both. What I'm talking about is that he'll always be with us in the sense that the amount of material he recorded over the decade-plus before his death was completely overwhelming. When Los Angeles blogger and music journalist Jeff Weiss interviewed the Pharcyde back in May, Imani mentioned that when Labcabincalifornia was being recorded, Dilla gave them ""hundreds of beats"" to choose from. And since Donuts became the last album issued in his lifetime, it's been followed by a flood of releases-- sanctioned and otherwise-- that've raided his archives and spilled forth a flood of previously-unheard detritus that rivals the early-1970s post-mortem output of Jimi Hendrix. Sadly, not all of that detritus has resulted in James Yancey's bills getting paid. His mother's been infamously entangled in rights issues with the executor of Dilla's estate, who has blocked the releases of more than a few projects that might've helped his family financially and brought some of his vault material to light. But Jay Stay Paid should hopefully circumvent that, since it puts a new piece of Dilla's musical legacy in good hands and creates a life-spanning statement in a way that previous memorial assemblages like 2006's The Shining could only hint at. Jay Stay Paid isn't a cash-in piece of vulturework, but a labor of love executive produced by his mother and assembled, arranged, and mixed by Pete Rock, one of Dilla's greatest influences. You couldn't come up with two people more qualified to help turn the DAT-stored scraps and sketches of Dilla's ideas into a full-fledged work of art. The source material on Jay Stay Paid runs the gamut from 90s Ummah-era loops to beats Dilla was putting together from his hospital bed, but it stylistically falls in a general area that fits best between the dense but crisp boom-bap of his early-aughts material (i.e., Welcome 2 Detroit and Slum Village's Fantastic, Vol. 2) and the grimier, more frenetic beat-tape rawness of his Jaylib/Donuts L.A. phase. That latter aesthetic tends to permeate the surface here, filtered through a loose radio-show concept that interjects some actual disk jockey shoutouts, comedic asides, and brief interjections from the man himself. That bugged-out hyperkineticism keeps things moving, but it doesn't reduce the beats to ADD afterthoughts: Early scene-setting moments like the stuttering elasticity of the organ-riff loop in ""King"", the glowering Minimoog g-funk retrofuturism of ""I Told Y'all"", and the Morse-code keyboard of ""Lazer Gunne Funke"" don't run too long, but they sink in deeply. Like The Shining, Jay Stay Paid breaks up the instrumental passages with a number of guest appearances by various MCs, most of whom either worked with Dilla in the past or otherwise have some level of simpatico compatibility with his aesthetic. Raekwon, whose upcoming Only Built for Cuban Linx II will also feature a repurposed Dilla production, teams up with Mobb Deep's Havoc in a pairing that might seem at odds with Dilla's conscious-rap-friendly Ummah/Soulquarian rep, but the skittering beat, skulking bass, and late-night creeping atmospherics in ""24K Rap"" fit them perfectly. And the usual suspects-- DOOM muttering acerbic wordplay on ""Fire Wood Drumstix"", Black Thought throwing around reality show namedrops on the Latin guitar-driven bump of ""Reality TV"", a host of raw-spitting Detroit cohorts from Frank Nitti to Phat Kat to Dilla's own brother Illa J-- come at it with the reverence and enthusiasm of longtime friends and admirers who fully understand the gravity of the project they're doing. But Jay Stay Paid's biggest strengths don't lie in its guest roster, impressive as it is. It's the way these reconstructed, reassembled beats so vividly show off how left-field he was willing to get in the service of finding new ways to make a beat knock. Hearing ""Make It Fast Mega Mix"" turn the spooky burble of David Essex's ""Rock On"" into a sinuous players' anthem for up-and-comer Diz Gibran makes it sound like an obvious idea turned novel, and anyone who's paid attention to what Donuts brought to the table should find some welcome familiarity in the vintage 60s and 70s electronics that flicker across large swaths of the album; ""Spacecowboy vs. Bobblehead"", ""In the Night (Owl N Out) - While You Slept (I Crept)"", and ""On Stilts"" provide the brightest examples. But even for diehards, there's something on nearly every track here that gives his production some strange, intriguing angle: swooping astral choirs (""Milk Money""), a bizarre, fuzzed-out and pitched-up mutation of the Mothers of Invention's ""Oh No"" in ""9th Caller"", and the closing statement of ""KJay and We Out"", one of Dilla's characteristic glowing boom-clap beats overlaid with a faint psych-soul guitar that might be the most elegiac beat dropped since his passing. This may not be the last we hear of some long-lost, recently-unearthed material of Dilla's, but you can consider this the most heartfelt eulogy Pete Rock's had a hand in since ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"", and the definitive document so far from the family that misses him.","Collection of unreleased material from the late producer runs the gamut from 90s Ummah-era loops to beats he put together from his hospital bed.

Further Complications,Jarvis Cocker,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b09d034d5c69bf311c/1:1/w_160/b709a850.jpg,2009-06-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13151-further-complications/,Rough Trade,"The madcap video for ""Don't Let Him Waste Your Time"" off of Jarvis Cocker's 2006 solo debut had our square-framed hero playing world's worst taxi driver while giving a young lady some sage advice. ""Cause the years fly by in an instant, and you wonder what he's waiting for,"" he offers. ""Then some skinny bitch walks by in some hot pants and he's running out the door."" While the one-time Britpop sex god was almost definitely speaking from experience, the song took on a professorial tone. This is a guy who's done almost all there is to do in rock-- from toiling in the 1980s to exploding and then coming down with Pulp in the 90s-- and, on Jarvis, he seemed ready to look back on a winning career with equal parts despair and whimsy. Despair because he's a 40-something rock'n'roller who's smart enough to know what that can look like, and whimsy because he's Jarvis Cocker. Age looked and sounded good on him; he was growing into his elbow patches well. Alas, Cocker's life of peace is not to be. ""Further complications in store, yeah!"" he yelps on the opener here, introducing a cracked and wily album markedly more invigorated than his previous solo effort, but not always for the best. An abundance of ill-advised facial hair along with songs titles like ""Homewrecker!"" and ""I Never Said I Was Deep"" suggested it, and then tabloids confirmed it-- this is a breakup album. But Further Complications isn't one of those maudlin, woe-is-me affairs (as if Jarvis was capable of such mawkishness). It's a jutting, joking, hard-riffing jolt filled with raw self-deprecation. He's not blue-filtered and contemplative on his album cover, he's scrunched up against stark white, like the goofy aftermath of a Robert Longo drawing. ""If every relationship is a two-way street, I have been screwing in the back whilst you drive,"" he admits, arching his brow while holding an antique magnifying glass up to his own inadequacies. The line is from ""I Never Said I Was Deep"", the album's clearest contender for a future comp. On it, Cocker plays a game with the listener, i.e, how unsympathetic can he make himself while still drawing adoration from his audience? ""I never said that I was clever,"" he croons on a hook that's quite clever. ""My morality is shabby, my behavior unacceptable,"" he self-critiques later on. But right before you can think, ""C'mon Jarvis, don't beat yourself up, man,"" he delivers both the song's thematic peak and its narrative nadir: ""No, I'm not looking for a relationship-- just a willing receptacle."" The sentiment is damn near unforgivable, but Cocker survives it unscathed. Elevated, even. Backed by woozy, nonchalantly soulful instrumentation, the song is a thinking man's anti-thinking anthem and it's several kinds of genius. When the lanky frontman allows his current rawk jonze to take over, things get a bit pricklier. For someone famous for his dramatic flair, enlisting producer Steve Albini was not the most obvious choice. And it's not like the austere, anti-reverb studio rat was going to adjust his style for Jarvis-- the dry Albini snares and unfussy live-ness is well in place. Thing is, Jarvis can't quite pull off some of these herky jerky Stooge-y tracks. (On record, at least-- several songs here came off much better with Jarvis gesticulating furiously during his U.S. tour last year.) While his songwriting remains funny and incisive at 45, ostensibly ballsier numbers like ""Fuckingsong"" and ""Angela"" veer dangerously close to bar-band boneheadedness. I know, I know: He never said he was deep. But still, Jarvis Cocker can't start popping-out largely wordless motorik like ""Pilchard""-- a song he apparently ""never got around to writing,"" according to a recent interview-- and expect to strut away scot-free. A move like that is more unforgivable than a thousand Wilde-style put-downs. ""Kittens are cute, but a full grown cat can be cuter,"" sings Jarvis on the easy listening ballad ""Hold Still"". It's wishful thinking, even for a guy facing middle age with heaps of respectably bold fearlessness and a solid head of hair. On Further Complications, Cocker is a wreck-- a sometimes amusing (""Leftovers""), sometimes profane (""Fuckingsong"") jumble of anger and concession. ""In the beginning there was nothing, and to be honest that suited me just fine,"" he growls on the title track. But Jarvis isn't meant for a quiet life. He's too good at turning social pratfalls into proletariat art. He still hasn't figured things out, and he's coming to terms with the fact that he never will. ""It's a complicated boogie, and I don't know any better,"" he screams on the title track. He sounds frustrated, but he shouldn't be. There are only a few songwriters who can make life's technical dance moves seem like such a worthwhile pursuit.","Former Pulp frontman's Steve Albini-produced album is a jutting, joking, hard-riffing jolt filled with raw self-deprecation and some unintended problems.

The Happiness Project,Charles Spearin,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46513d1975652138cd5/1:1/w_160/8f7f3023.jpg,2009-06-01 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13089-the-happiness-project/,Arts & Crafts,"People throw the term ""concept album"" around indiscriminately, but the new solo record by Broken Social Scene/Do Make Say Think multi-instrumentalist Charles Spearin truly earns that distinction. Part spoken-word collection, part sociological experiment, The Happiness Project is the result of Spearin's interviews with his neighbors in downtown Toronto about the idea of happiness-- recorded responses that he then turned into music. What's fascinating about this collection is not only what the interviewees have to say-- Marisa thinks that being ""a good people-person"" is what's important, Vittoria likes school on Valentine's Day when they just get to make art instead of work-- but also the way that Spearin spins the cadence of their voices into tunes. Childish temper tantrum ""Ondine"" (""Not almond butter, Mama. I just want butter"") turns an irritatingly high-pitched kid's whine into a sliding violin melody bolstered by a delicate harp-and-piano foundation. And ""Mrs. Morris""'s proclamation that ""happiness is love"" is rendered as a be-bop saxophone ditty that matches the alto tones of her speaking voice with the sax's own cool, deep timbre. The tunes on the collection appear as if by magic. You hear people talking, and then their speech is transformed into honeyed horn patter (as on ""Anna"") or galloping guitar arpeggios (as on ""Marisa""). ""Vittoria"", for example, spins a young girl's lazy ""like""s and ""um""s into percussive, brass- and reed-inflected bachelor-pad music perfect for a late-1960s James Bond chase scene. But the most moving of the collection's eight tracks is ""Vanessa"", which grows from a spare, reedy dirge into a celebration of twinkling pianos, sweeping strings, and sunburst guitars that mimic the vocal cadence of a deaf woman as she recounts the story of her cochlear implant surgery and its subsequent effect on her hearing and her life. ""People often asked me, over the years, 'What do you hear?'"" she says at the beginning of the track matter-of-factly with no music in the background to illustrate the silence in her head. ""I couldn't really answer because I didn't know what it was like to hear, so how could I compare?"" But by the end of the track, as she talks about the implant being turned on after the mandatory four-week waiting period, the instruments come alive beneath her voice, just like the sound that bloomed for her for the first time. The piano line is poignant and giddy as it imitates the mellifluence of her voice. ""All of a sudden I felt my body moving inside,"" she says, describing the feeling of her brain taking in aural information for the first time ever. The track then shrinks back to silence as Vanessa explains that her implant only has a limited battery, and so when it shuts off she actually experiences that lack of sound. ""Now,"" she says, after the last lingering piano note has stopped resonating,"" I understand the term 'dead silence.'"" ""Vanessa"" may be too fractured to be a pop song, but you'll be hard-pressed to find another recorded track this viscerally affecting. The stories told on The Happiness Project are moving and ordinary and strange, and the way Spearin makes you hear the music of spoken language by translating speech patterns into notes is truly thrilling. But some of these tracks are better as stories than songs (namely, the noodly guitars of ""Mr. Gowrie"", which is a nostalgic tale from an immigrant far from his homeland where life was difficult but perhaps richer with family). And even the most moving tracks are still not quite songs. Spearin's experiment is fruitful, nonetheless, helping listeners hear the beauty of everyday speech and appreciate the happiness that comes from life's most commonplace moments.","An intriguing release from the Broken Social Scene/Do Make Say Think member finds ordinary speech transformed into strange but affecting music.

Journal For Plague Lovers,Manic Street Preachers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4afc0084474cd0c0546/1:1/w_160/0f911286.jpg,2009-06-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13150-journal-for-plague-lovers/,Columbia,"In 2008, Richey Edwards' official status was changed from ""Missing"" to ""Presumed Dead"" at the request of his family. His fate has been a mystery since February 1, 1995, when he left the Embassy Hotel in London. His car was found on Valentine's Day near a notorious suicide spot, but he left no other physical traces. What he did leave behind was his band, the Manic Street Preachers, who continued as a trio in his absence with his family's blessing. Sean Moore, Nicky Wire, and James Dean Bradfield have never quite left him behind-- his lyrics appeared on a few songs on Everything Must Go, their first album without him, and they've kept aside a share of royalties on the increasingly remote chance Edwards will return some day. A few weeks prior to his disappearance, Edwards gave Wire a folder filled with lyrics and poetry. It had a picture of Bugs Bunny on the cover, with the word ""opulence"" scrawled across it. For their ninth album, the band has turned to this folder for one last harrowing look into the mind of their absent friend. Edwards' lyrics, slightly edited by Wire, feature on every song, and the album as a whole completes something of a return to form begun on 2007's Send Away the Tigers. The band was a bit rudderless after 1998's This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, and Tigers seemed a conscious attempt to recapture a sense of direction-- the backward ""r""s in the album art intentionally harked back to the band's 1994 masterpiece The Holy Bible. Here, the throwback to their peak is even more pronounced: The album art is a painting by Holy Bible artist Jenny Saville (bizarrely censored by some British grocery chains), the lyrics are by Edwards, and the music, recorded by Steve Albini, is nasty and tangled, and they've even nodded to The Holy Bible's use of interstitial sound clips from news broadcasts and movies. From any other band, such a precise return to ground already covered might seem cynical, but these guys have never been anything but honest, and there seems to be a genuine desire not to let their deceased colleague's words go to waste. ""Peeled Apples"" opens the album with a colossal kick to the head as a queasy bassline is joined by pounding drums and sandpaper guitar to back Bradfield's righteous shout. He's always had a talent for torturing the words Edwards and Wire provided him into durable melodies, and it's no different here. This song, ""Marlon J.D."" and the hidden track, ""Bag Lady"", are musically the most hard-hitting things this band has done since 1994. ""Marlon"" opens with the walloping couplet, ""He stood like a statue/ As he was beaten across the face,"" and runs through an absurdly catchy verse from there. It's not all bone-crushing hard rock, though. The title track has a clear-eyed rock jangle to pair with its heavy crunch, and ""Facing Page: Top Left"" is as gentle and quiet as the Manics get, bathing its verses about the beauty regime in acoustic guitar and a splattering of piano. ""Doors Closing Slowly"" rather awkwardly ends with a passage from The Virgin Suicides, one of a few cracks in the album's armor. The biggest is ""William's Last Words"", sung by Nicky Wire instead of Bradfield, as if to remind us why Bradfield is the band's lead singer. At just over four minutes, it's by far the album's longest song, and also its least memorable by any musical measure, though I imagine that, for the band, working on that one was emotional because of its lyrics, which essentially read like a goodbye to the band from Edwards. Even if it were the desperate or cynical move some people have claimed it is, there's no denying that purging Edwards' old lyric folder has helped the band create its best album in a decade. Quite simply, they haven't sounded so focused or so purposeful in a long, long time, and they are at their best with a sense of purpose underpinning their music. The charge that it sounds like The Holy Bible's little brother is accurate, but I'd argue that this isn't a bad thing at all, and I hope they find a way to build on the momentum they've created here. The little brother of Everything Must Go would be welcome, too.","Built around lyrics from presumed-dead founding member Richey Edwards and recorded by Steve Albini, the Manics' latest finds them revitalized.

"21st Century, 21st Year",Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a449b1335d7bf1698905/1:1/w_160/f1780856.jpg,2009-06-01 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13065-21st-century-21st-year/,Luaka Bop,"Our love affair with nice, neat, round numbers has less to do with their symbolic value and more to do with their tidy divisibility. But from blackjack to getting blitzed, the number 21 proves the rare exception. Even so, one wonders if Luaka Bop: 21st Century, 21st Year, a comp celebrating the awkward 21st anniversary of the Luaka Bop label, was as much a victim of circumstance as design. Luaka Bop spent much of 2007 in limbo, searching for a new distributor after V2 went under. Even once they were back up and running, LB releases were relatively few and far between. It took a while to wend through the backlog of unreleased records (Jim White, Kassin, et al.), and now that Luaka Bop seems to be back on track-- well, 21st anniversary it is. Anniversary or no, in many ways every Luaka Bop release has been a celebration of sorts, of some great acts rescued from semi-obscurity (Shuggie Otis or Tom ZÃ©), music rendered to the margins of the mainstream (its various Brazilian or World Psychedelic Classics comps), or global pop stars in search of a Western audience (like Zap Mama or Susana Baca). Putting its name and reputation behind these releases made Luaka Bop as important as any imprint in negating the need for the word ""world"" in ""world music"" and underscoring the qualities that all great artists share rather than their differences. Yet it's hard to know just what we're actually meant to take away from the meager 15 tracks included in the set. They are a mere tease of the breadth and diversity of Luaka Bop's catalog, which over the years has given a home to acts as varied as A.R. Kane and ZÃ©. If every Luaka Bop release is a celebration, this one feels a little more like a sampler, drawing from the label's dozens of releases for the most cursory and, by necessity, far from comprehensive of overviews. The inscrutable Tom ZÃ© is here, of course, as well as Jorge Ben, Marcio Local, Os Mutantes (""Baby"", natch) and Moreno + 2 (Caetano Veloso's son), amply representing quirky Brazilian pop from the past to the present. From West Africa, we get a funky track from Mali's Moussa Doumbia. We get a handful of unclassifiable songs from journeymen acts such as Shuggie Otis (the psych-folk-funk of ""Aht Uh Mi Hed""), Zap Mama, Jim White, Geggy Tah, and label founder David Byrne himself (his ""Fuzzy Freaky"", a rootless trip-hop excursion from the Feelings album). Cuba's Irakere, Peru's Susana Baca, and Venezuela's Los Amigos Invisibles provide a snapshot of Latin-American pop, while France's Nouvelle Vague represents provides breezy boho kitsch with its re-imagined de-discoed cover of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"". That song aside, just about every track on here is ace. But so are the albums and comps-- many trailblazers at the time-- from which they are taken. If you're late to the game (like, 21 years late) then Luaka Bop: 21st Century, 21st Year could be a starting point. For the rest of us, the disc underscores both how far we've come as music consumers (the deep waters of TropicÃ¡lia or West African funk are much more familiar) but also how far the West still lags behind. Conspicuously, the closest Luaka Bop has come to shepherding a hit-- Cornershop's ""Brimful of Asha""-- isn't to be found on the disc, nor is the band itself. It's as if, so many years down the line, the label still feels compelled to place the emphasis on the less familiar, in the dogged hope that one day everyone will finally recognize the hidden-in-plain-sight riches around us and start filling their pockets.","David Byrne's label celebrates 21 years in business with a comp that includes Tom ZÃ©, Os Mutantes, Shuggie Otis, Zap Mama, and the proprietor himself.

II,LindstrÃ¸m & Prins Thomas,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4485e6ef95969320836/1:1/w_160/336ee2cc.jpg,2009-06-01 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13064-ii/,Eskimo,"Mellow, smooth, relaxing: In traditional pop music lingo, these are euphemisms for ""boring as hell."" But traditional pop music lingo never got around to anticipating the downtempo, prog-infused strain of house music that eventually became generally known as space disco. At its best, it's music that throws you off by how calm and airy it feels on the surface, and right when you're about to be lulled halfway to inattention, the rhythms start to build on top of each other and the melodies start seeping into the forefront and you're hooked. You have Norwegian producer, studio wizard, and multi-instrumentalist Hans-Peter LindstrÃ¸m to thank for helping space disco evolve into its current 21st century incarnation, and countryman Thomas Moen Hermansen (aka Prins Thomas) to thank for giving it a serious foothold by joining LindstrÃ¸m on their first, self-titled collaborative album in 2005. After the two producers crafted some of their finest work last year-- the epic Where You Go I Go Too for LindstrÃ¸m; a host of top-shelf remixes for Thomas (including a staggering reworking of City Reverb's ""City of Lights"")-- the timing's right for a full-length return to their partnership, even if they have some triumphant recent history shadowing them. Fortunately, II isn't a letdown-- assuming you don't count its lack of immediacy as a disappointment. On the first LindstrÃ¸m & Prins Thomas album, eight out of 13 tracks ran less than six minutes, and most of them gave you a pretty good idea of where they were going right away. Here, only one of the eight songs clocks in under seven-and-a-half, and the standard structure relies on slow-build compositions that stretch out, decompress, and mutate; they don't so much segue from track to track as they melt into each other. And while it might feel a little like a marathon anywhere other than the dancefloor, there's more than enough going on over the course of a track-- instruments warping themselves into new beats, new riffs, and new melodies-- to give it a certain dynamism. Listen to a song as a whole, and it'll sound like a gradual ramping-up from a simple theme into a jammy, psychedelic expansion; listen to it again and zero in on just the percussion or keyboards or guitar and that experience will be brought into a vivid, deep focus. But it still works in a way that never really overwhelms the song's driving rhythmic backbone-- light as some of it may feel, it's still dance music. The first four tracks on II are more than vivid enough to draw the first-time listener in, even if they defy easy description. Opener ""Cisco"" is the track that has some people dubbing this L&PT's ""rock"" move, but its multi-tracked guitars chime and twang over a bongo-accented funk groove with a tone that's about as close to the Alan Parsons Project as Chic were. By the time it hits its full stride halfway through, drenched in towering synthesizers and phase-shifted fuzztones, it's a sturdy embodiment of what makes both producers such kitchen-sink auteurs. That momentum continues over the next few tracks, whirring like an irregularly-orbiting satellite around hyper-dense drums and Moroder/Vangelis atmosphere in ""Rothaus"", trembling and then briskly trotting beneath the wintry, shapeshifting piano theme in ""For Ett Slikk Og Ingenting"", and loosening its joints for the crackling energy of the shifty ""Rett PÃ¥"", the most tightly-packed song on the record; it sounds like there's about a half-dozen different rhythmic ideas going on at once there, and they all somehow manage to sync. The last four tracks are a little less frenetic, if no less involved. The final two in particular-- ""Note I Love You + 100"" and ""Flue PÃ¥ Veggen""-- are more than Â 24 minutes combined, and they both hit an interesting nerve of cross-era aesthetics, particularly in how the former features a mid-70s Fender Rhodes that slowly liquefies into a burbling new-wave synth, and the latter fuses a disco drum machine with haywire analog burbles, wordless vocal melodies, and crystalline chimes. You can kind of imagine the ingredients for this album coming from a number of different sources-- prog rock, krautrock, disco, funk, MOR pop, maybe even some folk here and there-- but at this point there's just so much potential influence it's hard not to hear the whole instead. And it's a hell of a lot of whole, too: It's mellow and smooth and relaxing, sure, but it's also unpredictable and full of little revelations and turns of sound that make it one of space disco's crowning recent achievements. If LindstrÃ¸m and Thomas ever drop a III on us, it'll have a lot to live up to.","After top-shelf work apart-- LindstrÃ¸m's 2008 LP; Thomas' remixes-- the space disco pioneers re-team for a new record that bests their debut.

LeftRightLeftRightLeft,Coldplay,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a456ea9e61561daa4ea9/1:1/w_160/909de45a.jpg,2009-06-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13074-leftrightleftrightleft/,self-released,"When most of the world first met Chris Martin, he was a sad dude wandering around a beach in his windbreaker and singing about everything being yellow. If Coldplay started out as one of many earnest post-Britpop bands in the late 1990s, they've beaten the odds to become one of the biggest bands in the world, the kind whose album releases become events and whose impact reaches beyond the confines of a genre, country, or audience. Coldplay are, in short, the kind of band that can give away a live album gratis. LeftRightLeftRightLeft is free to anyone with a ticket at their live shows and anyone with an internet connection at their web site. While I'm sure there's a suit somewhere tearing his hair out over this, it's not quite as ballsy as Prince giving away free copies of Musicology or bundling Planet Earth with the London Daily Mail. On the other hand, you might want to listen to LRLRL more than once. Seriously, they could be selling this shit. After all, Live 2003 got a full release complete with a DVD, and it doesn't even approach the confidence and dynamics of LRLRL, which showcases a band much more comfortable and commanding on stage. All the big moments they've tried to create in the studio finally come alive on these tracks: those tectonic shifts that push openerÂ ""Glass of Water""; the mechanistic jam ofÂ ""Clocks"", especially when Guy Berryman re-creates the vocal melody on bass against Martin's cascades of piano notes; the communal grandiosity ofÂ ""Viva la Vida"".  Despite a fairly conservative tracklist, LRLRL sounds like the band finally coming into its own, presenting as a live act rather than a studio band. Much of the credit goes to the audience-- those thousands of fans singing devotedly along with Martin and exploding during the big moments. Maybe that's why LRLRL is a giveaway: The crowd may be legally obligated to co-billing, especially that woman singing herself hoarse for a few notes onÂ ""The Hardest Part/Postcards from Far Away"". Here's a quick before-and-after demonstration: The opening lyrics toÂ ""42""Â are some of his worst, and Martin alone can't save them. But hearing him sing those same inane lyrics with a couple thousand people backing him up make that mood-setting melody sound pretty good actually. LRLRL owes its life to the audience, whose handclaps giveÂ ""Viva la Vida""Â the sense of heraldry missing from the album version and whose insistent singing onÂ ""Fix You""Â defuses the song's Messianic rumblings. Of course, the crowd can't rehab all of Coldplay's material.Â ""The Hardest Part/Postcards from Far Away""Â is a middling piano ballad that feints towardÂ ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word""Â territory but runs straight for Billy Joel. And ending withÂ ""Death and All His Friends"", especially afterÂ ""Fix You"", seems particularly anticlimactic. Martin no longer has to cajole the crowd into participating, as he did on Live 2003; instead, the band seems utterly confident the audience will hang on every word and note. Even so, he does deliver some overeager stage banter.Â ""This is the moment in the concert when we show you how good our band really could have been,""Â he says by way of introducing drummer Will Champion, who sings the short, strummyÂ ""Death Will Never Conquer"". Champion does a fine job, sounding late-Poguish and completely at ease, but Martin's comment seems little more than hollow self-deprecation, only pointing to his reputation as the band's handsome, actress-bagging, Jeff Buckley-copping frontman. And just try not to wince when he alters the lyrics to ""Fix You""Â and renders the song self-referential:Â ""five hundred meters from the band at the Coldplay show.""Â You can't touch the hem of his garment from that distance, but those are still pretty good seats. Coldplay are the biggest band in the world because they believe themselves to be, which is the kind of titanic self-actualization typically associated with salesmen and self-help books. But they are humble in their hubris: Not only do they provide a service-- essentially giving listeners what they want-- but in this case, they're doing it without charge. Ironically, those contradictory qualities mean the band may be wasted in a studio, Eno notwithstanding. LRLRL suggests that Coldplay songs truly live only in vast concert halls and smallish arenas, where they are performed for, and arguably by, a captivated audience.","Coldplay are giving this LP away, but they could be selling it; at the very least, it eclipses their previous in-concert effort, Live 2003.

Amesoeurs,Amesoeurs,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a447ea9e61561daa4e84/1:1/w_160/db2f6d7e.jpg,2009-05-29 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13063-amesoeurs/,Profound Lore,"Profound Lore has been knocking down the walls of black metal for a while. Label acts CaÃ¯na, Cobalt, and Wrath of the Weak alloy the genre with others, puzzling purists and delighting critics. Amesoeurs are the imprint's greatest challenge to categorization. This French band surveys black-clad music from the past 30 years-- post-punk, 4AD, shoegaze rock, dark ambience, black metal. The mix is both logical and disjointed. After this first and last full-length, Amesoeurs broke up due ""to internal conflicts and different points of view about the band's future."" Amesoeurs' debut EP, 2006's Ruines Humaines, practically forecast their demise. In three songs, they moved from distortion-drenched black metal to Joy Division-esque starkness. Black-metal shrieking sat uneasily next to female cooing. Guitarist/vocalist Neige held it all together. In a previous band, Peste Noire, he played black metal. In Alcest, he constructs an uncannily authentic recreation of My Bloody Valentine. In his hands, genres differ only in distortion pedal settings. Still, plumbing the depth and breadth of multiple styles is difficult, and the darkness of these particular ones makes the task only harder. Amesoeurs strive for Joy Division's heights/lows, but Joy Division were never meant to last. On Amesoeurs, all the band's influences are out in the open. The clean tones are cleaner than ever; the black metal is deeper and more depressive than ever. This contrast stretches the band thin. ""Heurt"" bolts together the melodic black metal of Wolves in the Throne Room with the softness of the Cure. ""Trouble"" is straight-ahead, storming black metal; ""Video Girl"" follows with the glistening jangles of the Police. A hidden electronic track at the end could be a Depeche Mode demo. The band diligently soaks its shoegaze sections in distortion. But with so many detours into blastbeats and the sparkle of 1980s Rush, it rarely redlines. ""Amesoeurs"" is a glorious exception. Sticking to bouncy post-punk, it strings up spiky riffs like Christmas lights. For four minutes, the band finds the common ground between Bloc Party and black metal. This full-length is Amesoeurs' fervid last gasp of creativity.Â The album's artwork is appropriate: Sounds like these could come only from cities. One guy in black runs into another. ""Hey, nice t-shirt. Wanna start a band?"" Music collections merge. Last trains of the night yield lyrics. Something happens. The band splits.Â They disappear back into the city, as apart as before. They leave behind this journal of triumph and heartbreak.","The Profound Lore band broke up following the release of this, their only full-length, which represents a fervid last gasp of genre-melding creativity.

Psychic Psummer,Cave,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a451ea9e61561daa4e9c/1:1/w_160/56d2a2ec.jpg,2009-05-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13071-psychic-psummer/,Important,"At their best, Chicago's Cave boil down familiar but disparate branches of psychedelic rock into a sludgy yet nimble whole. Their first album approached different modes like a kid in a candy store, dipping into heavy riffs, hypnotic repetition, and howling noise, but it sprinted and lagged, never pacing itself as expertly as the band does now. Psychic Psummer is comparatively a less-immediate listen, but it is a deeper and ultimately more rewarding one. It's less of a wrecking ball and more of an assured roll, tumbling like an enormous slow-moving boulder through the band's diverse brand of burly and blissed-out space-rock. As a mostly-instrumental album, there's a lot of tension and release in these songs, as well as healthy doses of repetition. But Cave continually toy with and subvert these familiar methods in ways that are as cathartic as they are clever. Opener ""Gamm"" bores through space with its reverberating vocals and windmill guitar strums, veering between explosiveness and a quieter, tenser lockstep martial beat, before ending on a lower-tempo sigh of relief. ""Made in Malaysia"" is a faster and more surprising follow-up, with a frantic Morse-code keyboard pattern that the band follows in vicious syncopation before bowing into some monstrous circular riffs. There's still a drifting chill-down moment, as with many Cave songs, but it's with a more nervous pulse, pushed by the occasional vocal provocation. The loping beat, skittering percussion, and robot keyboards of ""Encino Men"" sounds as good-naturedly goofy as that the name evokes. The moments of release here and throughout the record are muscular without being obvious, and with vintage organ and guitar tones as dry as the band's mouths after some bong-delivered inspiration. Speaking of which, ""High, I Am"" ironically winds up a bit more straightforward than most of Psychic Psummer. Its groove is solid and taut and driven by domineering bass and toms, and squirts of keyboard and percussive weirdness make it sound like an underwater level of any 16-bit video game. The band plays themselves out with placid Moog tone and loose drumming of ""Machines and Muscles"", ending in a simple, satisfying denouement. The album doesnât out-freak their peers, but nor does it mean to; Psychic Psummer takes the creative restlessness of the band's debut a step further into something much more linear, and rides the line between the studious and the sublime like an act thatâs been around much longer than a couple years. It takes an immense amount of structuring and sweat on their end for you to drift away on yours, and the result is so seamless they make it look easy.","Cave specialize in pounding, hypnotic instrumental rock, and a track here called ""High, I Am"" hints at their inspiration.

theFREEhoudini,Themselves,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4aec0084474cd0c0544/1:1/w_160/fabcf816.jpg,2009-05-29 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13149-thefreehoudini/,Anticon,"When the hip-hop collective Anticon first came on the scene with 1999's Music for the Advancement of Hip Hop, they presented an illusion of a united front, a group sharing an aesthetic and plans for domination. But this sense disappeared almost immediately as the core artists-- Sole, Alias, Doseone, Jel, and Pedestrian-- broke away into so many side collaborations that Anticon started to resemble a virus more than a movement. Over the years, they haven't so much expanded as metastasized, finding new converts (Sage Francis, Odd Nosdam, Dosh) as they splinter into smaller and smaller pieces and pursue their aggressively wayward interests. There are many possible explanations for this sort of artistic behavior (creative restlessness, for example), but it also represents a survival strategy. As Method Man once rhymed: ""Had to kill a schizophrenic nigga twice."" It's a little surprising, then, to find the Anticon crew back together on their new mixtape, theFREEHoudini, especially considering it's being billed as a new release by Themselves, a name that Doseone and Jel often record under together. theFREEHoudini is many things, but it is not a Themselves album. Instead, it's a gathering of nearly all the forces Anticon have assembled over the past decade in one place. Slug, Sole, Alias, Busdriver, Yoni Wolf of Why?, Buck 65-- the gang is all here, and, as you might expect, the room gets a little crowded. For the Anticon faithful, the class reunion of the theFREEHoudini is a cause for celebration, but for everyone else, it makes for a jumbled and unfocused listening experience. Sonically, there is nothing here to surprise you if you've paid attention to Anticon's last five or six years of releases. If there's a ferret hole of a subgenre to burrow into, they've found it by now, and their endlessly churning collage of ambient, minimal techno, IDM, and industrial has evolved to the point where the initiated can anticipate each hard left before it happens. It's still a place gloriously friendly to a comfy pair of headphones, full of babbling voices buried in the mix and drum hits so tactile they seem to stick to and then peel off your ears. The drum break for ""The Mark"" is swarmed by little insect clouds of electronics and a sandstorm of found sound, whereas ""Free&Void"" seems to build its beat from the buzzing of a flickering fluorescent lamp. Whether slow or fast, the tracks emerge from a haze of analog tape hiss that suggests late-evening summer light. The rapping, as is increasingly the case with Anticon, is just another rhythmic element in tracks striving to recreate how it might feel to do a lot of bad coke in a steel foundry. Doseone, who in a past life was a pretty straightforward multi-syllable spitter (see 1998's Hemispheres for evidence), delivers his lines here in a demented cackle that can barely be heard beneath the metal-on-metal cacophony of the production. On ""Kick the Ball"", Buck 65 staggers all over the beat with goofy non sequiturs like ""got a job at a church, and I rocked them bells."" On ""Back2Burn"", Pedestrian's verse bears no relation, rhythmic or otherwise, to the clomping music in the foreground. The vets come off best. Over the loping backbeat of ""1 For No Money"", Sole packs his crowded stanzas with his usual poison-tipped misanthropy: ""This ain't a mixtape, it's an I-don't-give-a-fuck tape/ It's high-school revenge in a briefcase, who brought the duct tape?"" Def Jux guest Aesop Rock, on ""Know That to Know This"", spits something that feels shockingly close to a straight-up double-time rap over abstracted smears of guitar (granted, his punchlines still consist of things like ""Literally calling all heartworms back to the can from whence they came, jittery and drunk."") Frenetic, mercurial, and of wildly variable listenability, theFREEHoudini feels like a retrospective and a retrenchment of forces, but it also serves as yet another step in Anticon's breathless, never-ending push forward.","Doseone and Jel throw an Anticon class reunion, with spots from friends and collective members including Slug, Aesop Rock, Why?, Buck 65, Alias, and Sole.

The Glass Bead Game,James Blackshaw,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e1b1335d7bf1698819/1:1/w_160/8e3b855b.jpg,2009-05-29 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12972-the-glass-bead-game/,Young God,"James Blackshaw has made quite a name for himself in the post-Takoma school of guitar playing, coming closer than perhaps anyone to fulfilling the guitar-as-orchestra ambitions so many have harbored. He's an experimentalist, but rarely an obtuse one, and he's created some amazing, enveloping music. On The Glass Bead Game, Blackshaw's guitar is, as always, a heavenly instrument, but he continues to move further from the guy-and-guitar approach that established him, bringing in more varied instrumentation. Piano, also featured on last year's excellent Litany of Echoes, plays a far more central role here, and the record includes wordless vocals from Lavinia Blackwall, strings, flute, clarinet, and harmonium, the last of these played by Blackshaw himself. The album opens with a stunner in ""Cross"". Blackshaw's dexterous fingerstyle guitar playing sets down a rhythmic and harmonic foundation as the harmonium drones in the background, and eventually the violin and cello enter, alternately augmenting the drone and splitting off to follow their own melodic lines. Blackwall handles vocals, all of them wordless and odd and wonderful. These include a harmonized rhythmic pattern and a drifting, languid melody. The specifics of each individual part, though, are not nearly so important as the overall effect-- these sounds blur together into something transfixing, a nearly impossible combination of contemplation and urgency. Contemplation seems to dominate the rest of the album-- ""Bled"" explodes in a torrent of brilliant guitar in its mid-section, sounding more like an army of pluckers and strummers than just one man. But on its edges, the piece is slow and spare, as much space as actual notes. The other solo acoustic guitar piece, ""Key"", is flat-out beautiful, with an almost religious quality that's hard to pin down-- it sounds like it could have been captured in a church. The two piano-driven pieces lack the forward movement of the guitar-focused songs, in part because Blackshaw's keyboard technique lacks the subtly and deftness of his guitar playing. ""Fix"" is very pretty, accenting a nice piano part with violin and cello, but it's also repetitive to a fault and never quite gets anywhere. A friend of mine respectfully but firmly called it ""Philip Glass lite."" At nearly 19 minutes, ""Arc"" progresses from a simple, repeated piano figure in a sustain-pedal-down cloud of sound with voices and strings surfacing occasionally. It's an interesting piece of music, but until a small melodic phrase is introduced at the 14-minute mark, it lacks the forward motion he gives his guitar music that adheres to similar harmonic principles. Ultimately, the blur of the piece can wear a listener out. Still, Blackshaw's musical ideas are interesting enough that it's easy to see his piano pieces progressing as his technique comes along, opening another avenue to explore his musical concepts.","Gifted London-based guitarist and composer continues to expand his sound, here making greater use of piano as well as vocals, strings, and harmonium.

Monoliths & Dimensions,Sunn O))),by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e39d034d5c69bf3188/1:1/w_160/c529a509.jpg,2009-05-29 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13195-monoliths-dimensions/,Southern Lord,"If your interest in Sunn O))) stems primarily from the band's patient employment of tone and time as channeled through electric bass, electric guitar, and stacks of amplifiers, you might hate ""Alice"", the brilliant closing track of its seventh and arguably best album, Monoliths & Dimensions. Sure, these 17 minutes are loud and torpid, easing from one note to another, distortion dripping from each new intonation. But ""Alice"" finds Sunn O))) exploiting a newfound spaciousness and elegance. As its founders, Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley, crawl across a loose blues progression that mirrors those of slow metal fountainhead Earth, a swell of French and English horns, violin and viola, harp and light percussion rises. Surrounding the guitars, they're like the perfect summer haze, refracting and softening the season's relentless sunlight. ""Alice"" ends with a fanfare of sorts for this small orchestra. Its long tones are light and lifting, a little like Stars of the Lid commissioning Igor Stravinsky. More Fluorescent One than Black Two, it's completely unexpected, mesmerizing, and beautiful. Well, not completely unexpected: Like the rest of Monoliths & Dimensions, ""Alice"" offers a culmination of most everything Sunn O))) have done right during their decade of volume-based plunder. Anderson and O'Malley have long rendered rock riffs with painstaking deliberation, consistently adding the ideas of elite collaborators and occasional no-explanation experiments. The Grimm Robe Demos took to early Earth, while Black One ground an Immortal black metal burst into one 10-minute tectonic motion. Merzbow, Xasthur's Malefic, Thrones' Joe Preston, and Mayhem's Attila Csihar stood among high-ranking contributors. Pieces like ""bassALIENS"" (23 minutes of electric bass tone exploration) and ""My Wall"" (25 minutes of Julian Cope verbiage battered by cascades of amplifier hum) ensured that Sunn O))) was doing more than swapping chords for feedback. Monoliths & Dimensions takes the idea even further, gathering collaborators-- from Csihar and Earth's Dylan Carlson to Australian drone master Oren Ambarchi and vocalist Jessika Kenney, who sang so well on Wolves in the Throne Room's Two Hunters-- for four tracks that push Sunn O))) in directions unforeseen: Riffs come wrapped in strings. Conch shells share space with upright bass fleets. Both an operatic female choir and Portland noise nut Daniel Menche sing opposite the Mayhem frontman. All told, as on 2007's revelatory Black One, Monoliths & Dimensions indicates that Sunn O))) and the possibilities of its slow music stretch beyond what we imagined. About three-dozen people contribute to Monoliths' four cuts. Two of these tracks exceed 16 minutes, while their counterparts either approach or encroach on the 10-minute mark. It might seem that only size matters for Sunn O))) here, but that's just the surface. None of these pieces are big for bigness' sake. Rather, they all bear intricacies that erode them from within. A given piece's size becomes its fatal flaw. The strings and synthesizers ascend through the gaps in the sluggish riffs of ""Alice"", for instance, composer Eyvind Kang arranging the parts to crack and cover their host. By track's end, the guitars are gone, ruins eviscerated by a new growth of ivy. Then there's ""Big Church"". The female choir led by Kinney, a four-guitar army including Ambarchi and Carlson, and the manipulated Middle Earth incantations of Csihar clash during three three-minute sections. The guitars or the voices invoke each third, and their parts slip by one another like the pieces of an amoeboid jigsaw puzzle. Csihar always overruns them, though, pushing each section into a chaotic climax. On ""Hunting and Gathering (Cydonia)"", Csihar cloaks some of the album's most literal lyrics-- ""They take the world and the earth, breathing fire on the endless oil seas""-- in his native Hungarian, but the music makes the message clear. Each time Csihar finishes a set of imprecations, a triumph of vocals and horns rises and exalts while the electric riff subsides. This is a new battle hymn. And there's the album's other giant, opener ""Aghartha"". As close as Monoliths gets to the classic drone of Sunn O)))'s past, O'Malley and Anderson paw at chords on perfectly engineered electric bass and guitar. Again, a de facto chamber ensemble joins, as a droning Tibetan horn (the two-player Dung Chen) displaces the air beneath the guitars and sharp piano chords splinter whatever they encounter. These sounds sublimate into one drone, forcing the guitars out of the frame before fading into silence themselves. Only the sound of rushing water washes beneath Csihar's daunting voice, as he speaks of ""a tunnel [that] gouges in the shapes of the stream in the great abyss of the sky"" in booming, broken English. He's looking for new sparks to destroy the old order, for fresh energy to upset the established form. And that's exactly what Monoliths & Dimensions does: It takes one of the world's most lauded loud bands and rearranges its game with an inspiring cycle of risk and reward. Perhaps Black One came with a caveat emptor or two. You'd better like your music dark and relentless, and contextual understandings of Sunn O))) and black metal and drone helped. Lacking those things, perhaps you suspended your disbelief enough to appreciate Malfeic's scorched voice or, unfortunately, dismissed it outright as two self-serious dudes and their fucked-up friends dicking around with darkness. Incorrect, I think, but understandable. Monoliths & Dimensions requires no such warnings. Per Sunn O)))'s long-standing dogma, ""Maximum volume [still] yields maximum results."" But this time, there's enough musical range and temperance to usher even the most resolute naysayer into this intricate wonderland.","Sunn O)))'s latest album may be their best, as dozens of collaborators join on four epic tracks that run from slow metal to shimmering orchestral drone.

Dim the Aurora,Monahans,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43eb1335d7bf16988ea/1:1/w_160/16aaab7a.jpg,2009-05-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13056-dim-the-aurora/,Misra,"The prevailing wisdom about alt-country's great drummers is that there are none. Monahans, then, had to go a long way to get some interesting drums in their songs. Born in Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood before relocating to Austin, they were originally known as Milton Mapes, a third- or fourth-gen alt-country act with strong songwriting, decent harmonies, some casually inventive guitars, and drums that were perfectly adequate. Feeling hemmed in by the restrictions of the form (which seems to be the shared story of most of the genre's career acts, from Wilco to Joe Henry to Old 97's), Milton Mapes broke up, then the four members got back together as Monahans, taking their name from a small town in west Texas. The quartet had to shed all of its associations, including its collective identity, to escape alt-country's tug. ""It's Enough to Leave You..."", which opens Dim the Aurora, their second album as Monahans and first for Misra, puts Roberto SÃ¡nchez's drums right at the forefront, with a desperately steady beat that pushes the songs forward at a midtempo that wants to-- but never does-- break free into a full gallop. SÃ¡nchez is more than simply a timekeeper here, but an instrumentalist on equal footing with the guitars: That tambourine puts the jangle in ""It's Enough to Leave You..."", his toms ratchet the tension on the clockwork instrumental ""Night #3"" and bleed into the mandolin strums on ""Over Fields"". On ""Fit for Fire"", his drums and Britton Beisenherz's Bad Seeds-style bassline provide the latticework on which Greg Vanderpool and Jim Fredley hang their darting guitar licks. It's not so much that Monahans' new sound allows for greater rhythmic presence, but that SÃ¡nchez's elevated position in the group allows them to create that new sound, to pivot in new directions. Bouncing on that drumbeat, ""It's Enough to Leave You..."" immediately showcases their ability to write dusty, concise hooks and to resolve melodies in interesting, unexpected ways. Monahans turn ""Slow Burn"" and ""The Low Light"" into surprisingly tender slow-dance numbers that echo any of Will Johnson's projects (unsurprisingly, he sings harmonies on the latter), and the messier, more abrasive ""Fit for Fire"" sets Vanderpool and Fredley's tight harmonies against a maelstrom of horns and feedback. On Dim the Aurora, atmosphere takes as much priority as songwriting, as the band makes the music do as much as the lyrics. But ambience is easy, and Monahans occasionally use it as a crutch. The instrumental ""Terrene"" consists primarily of guitar scribbles and half-hearted timekeeping, reminiscent of Danel Lanois' dull Belladonna or, worse, Eric Clapton's Rush soundtrack. Except it goes on and on and on, finally fading out after 21 minutes. In all that time, they never wander in the path of an oncoming melody or really develop a theme, but simply sustain an easy high-desert mood that's not compelling five minutes in and even less so 15 minutes later. Most bands relegate this kind of indulgence to the final or hidden track (see Neko Case's ""Marais le Nuit""), but there's one more song to go on Dim the Aurora, the slow-motion amble ""Distorted Signals"". It's hardly worth the wait. In 20 minutes Monahans squander all the goodwill those drums bought them.","Austin-via-Dallas band distinguish themselves from other alt-country acts with an emphasis on powerful rhythms.

Untitled #23,The Church,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4469d034d5c69bf301a/1:1/w_160/993482f6.jpg,2009-05-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13062-untitled-23/,Second MotionUnorthodox,"Next year, the Church will be thirty years old. The Sydney, Australia, quartet is among the longest-lived, most prolific bands of the last three decades, but in North America, they're pretty much known as a one-hit wonder for 1988's haunted, atmospheric single ""Under the Milky Way"". It's really not fair because, apart from the late 1990s, they've been consistently good, and LPs like SÃ©ance, Priest = Aura, and Heyday deserve to be heard in their entirety. The band regained its bearings early this decade, and 2006's Uninvited, Like the Clouds ranks among their finest albums. Untitled #23, their ironically titled 23rd album (following their Australian discography, that is), isn't quite on that level, but it's still very good. The primary thing Uninvited had that Untitled doesn't is a big, sweeping single like the former's swirling centerpiece, ""Unified Field"". But while it may lack an immediately gratifying standout, Untitled #23 is a satisfying album, the kind of record that makes a big catalogue richer and more fun to explore. While it shares some similarities with the band's blissed-out late-80s/early-90s output, Untitled represents a distinct place in the band's career, with slow tempos, languid vocal melodies, and a bigger focus on keyboards than the interplay of Marty Willson Piper and Peter Koppes' guitars. Drummer Tim Powles, with the band since 1994, keeps things basic, opening ""Cobalt Blue"" with a steady Bonham stomp and staying in the pocket from there. Meanwhile, bassist/vocalist Steve Kilbey is in fine form throughout-- his old-school sing-speak on closer ""Operetta"" momentarily fooled me into thinking it was Bowie doing a guest turn. ""Pangaea"" seems an odd choice for a first single, with its spoken vocals and barely there chorus, and in spite of the backing vocals and violin that sweeten the song's texture, it's ultimately not very memorable. A more obvious choice might have been ""Deadman's Hand"", a guitar-soaked blast from the past, stuffed full of breathy harmonies, that seemingly glows from within. There are a few other moments of uncommon gorgeousness sprinkled across the album, none more shocking or brilliant than the jazz-tinged guitar solo on ""Cobalt Blue"", which starts off with a few completely counterintuitive phrases before tying them back into the melody and has a tone that matches the title of the song. The interstellar pound of ""Space Saviour"", the interlaced vocal lines of ""Operetta"", and the pulsing dirge ""On Angel Street"" all reveal a band still full of ideas and willing to pursue a risk. One of the contributing factors to the band's recent resurrection may be that they've taken complete control of their music, handling their production duties and recording when and where they want to, free from the kind of manipulation and pressure record labels once exerted on them. The Church are still producing at a high level, and Untitled #23 is a must for anyone who's followed them this far.","Australian band best known in the U.S. for ""Under the Milky Way"" have kept at it all these years and are still making solid music here on their 23rd album.

Polly Scattergood,Polly Scattergood,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a443c0084474cd0c045b/1:1/w_160/6fd26e09.jpg,2009-05-28 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13059-polly-scattergood/,Mute,"Reading the lyrics sheet that comes with Polly Scattergood's self-titled debut album can feel a bit like stumbling upon a stranger's cryptic yet intensely personal blog. It's all raw emotion and strident self-affirmation, but the sentiment is presented without much context or concrete detail, which makes her confessional statements come across with an awkward, anonymous intimacy. It's clear that she's spilling her guts and needs to express herself, but even at her most direct, it's difficult not to get the impression that she is keeping herself at a distance from her audience. We may relate to what she is singing-- there is a good chance of this, given that she's mostly writing about general relationship drama-- but there is a quiet implication that these songs are all about her, and only her. This is not unengaging or uninteresting, but it can be rather uninviting. Scattergood's songs tend to follow the same structural arc, building from fragile, ethereal balladry up to a highly dramatic catharsis, usually in the form of an enormous stadium-blasting crescendo. She allows some tracks, such as ""Untitled 27"" and ""Bunny Club"", to be relatively understated, but even her least bombastic cuts have an escalating tension, and convey a sense of desperation and urgency. Clearly, subtlety is not Scattergood's strong suit. She is at her best when she goes all the way, and pairs the potent emotions of her lyrics with unabashedly anthemic choruses. This is especially true on the single ""Nitrogen Pink"", which hits its multiple climaxes with incredible gusto without losing its essential, highly feminine grace, and basically sounds like Kate Bush doing her own version of ""Born to Run"". ""Other Too Endless"" hits a similar sweet spot with its sweeping, lovesick melodrama, and ""Unforgiving Arms"" tugs on the heartstrings with such ruthless precision that it would seem like a waste if it never ended up soundtracking a break-up scene in a romantic comedy. But there are two big problems with this record. The first is that a little bit of Scattergood goes a long, long way, and her relentless grandiosity wears thin very quickly. Though the album is sequenced to separate the biggest numbers, the result is nevertheless draining, and it's all too easy to tire of the album long before coming along to the best tracks, which are mostly in the back-end. The second issue is that, while she does include some interesting musical textures on ""Nitrogen Pink"" and ""I Hate the Way"", Scattergood leans hard on cold, uninspired tones that could be heard on any number of bland, over-produced efforts churned out by major labels. This does not always derail her songs, but the sheer dullness of some of the instrumentation exacerbates the overall drag of the album, and takes the emphasis off of the more distinct and endearing aspects of her voice and persona. Even with its flaws, Polly Scattergood is a solid debut, at least in the sense that she has firmly established her aesthetic, and has proved herself capable of excelling when at her most ambitious. It is not hard to imagine that Scattergood will eventually make much better records-- she certainly has a gift for melody and a fine singing voice-- but she's just not quite there yet. For the moment, cherry-pick the highlights from this album, and cross your fingers for her sophomore release.","On her debut, this English singer-songwriter combines intimate themes with songs that start as ethereal ballads and build to a dramatic catharsis.

Gone Fishing,The Cool Kids,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e2ea9e61561daa4ff7/1:1/w_160/3ff90e63.jpg,2009-05-28 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13192-gone-fishing/,self-released,"""I know you're ripping the packaging off your CD,"" Don Cannon bellows near the end of ""Introduction to Ice Fishing"". ""If you're like me, you're reading the credits right now!"" That could be a joke or a reference to Jay-Z's Vol. 3 intro, but somehow it comes out sounding like an indication of deep cluelessness, especially as rendered in Cannon's imitation-DJ-Drama blare. (Seriously, they sound exactly like each other.) Nobody's ripping the packaging off Gone Fishing because, as far as I can tell, no physical copies of the thing even exist. The Cool Kids occupy this weird only-in-2009 unexplored territory in which they don't actually have to sell or even make CDs to score Mountain Dew marketing money or soundtrack Kevin Garnett's atrocious dancing. They're an internet phenomenon, and that appears to be all they aspire to. And so Gone Fishing, a full hour of new Cool Kids music that they're offering for free download, should be a major event in the group's evolution. I guess. Maybe. But Gone Fishing sounds like what it probably is: A collection of castoffs that weren't good enough to make When Fish Ride Bicycles, the full-length debut album that's supposedly coming at some point. The mixtape is a weird format for a group like this. Last year's The Bake Sale EP worked in part because it was short; a half-hour of their minimal, nonchalant mid-1980s revivalism is really all anyone needs to hear at any one time. Gone Fishing, by contrast, starts dragging before it's half over, the blasÃ© fashion-talk and untroubled picking-up-chicks stories melting together into a bored-afternoon blur. The weirdly muffled and flat mastering job really hurts a group for whom crispy neck-snap snares are a principle virtue. As calm and casual as The Bake Sale was, the hooks had a sort of insistence that's altogether lacking here. And then there's Don Cannon. Cannon is a beast of a producer and a Southern mixtape kingpin, but it's weird to hear him yelling all over a Cool Kids mixtape since his aesthetic and the Kids' are almost exact opposites. Cannon tracks like OutKast's ""The Art of Storytelling, Part 4"" and Young Jeezy's ""Circulate"" get much of their power from their soul-derived organic warmth, which is a million miles removed from the Kids' frigid empty space. He produces a number of Gone Fishing tracks in collaboration with the group's Chuck Inglish, and it's an awkward match, Cannon's shards of guitar clashing clumsily with Chuck's 808 ticks. And his constant headachy drops do immeasurable damage to a group that works best when at its most dead-flat simplistic. But the main problem with Gone Fishing is that the songs just aren't as strong as the ones on The Bake Sale, or even the best of the various mp3 blog-bait tracks they've churned out before and after. As far as their punchlines, things never get much more clever than when they compare themselves to Launchpad and Darkwing Duck or more urgent than this: ""That's why we do it this way/ And it's fluent, nothing to it, let's get games of 2K."" When Ludacris and Bun B show up on ""Pennies (Updated Roster Remix)"", both past-their-prime Southern legends absolutely demolish the Kids on their own track without even trying. By itself, Bun's opening line (""I got a pocket full of profit and a wallet full of wonder/ A brain full of brawn and a throat that's full of thunder"") has about fifty bazillion times the rewind value of anything either Kid says here. And yet Gone Fishing is a long way from being a total loss. Even when they're on autopilot, their icy flatness has style. There is, after all, a sort of compelling chilliness to two young rappers who never give enough of a fuck to raise their voices one bit. And the beats, especially the ones done by Chuck alone, keep every last synth-wash and snare-hit in its exact right place. When it comes time to rap over other people's tracks, they don't hijack ""Gucci Bandana"" or ""Day 'N' Nite"". Instead, they make use of the Art of Noise's impressionistic synthpop masterpiece ""Moments in Love"", which by itself is worth the five minutes it takes to download the tape. But if they ever do get around to putting out that album, the Cool Kids will have to come up with at least a few more ideas as clever as that.","A new mixtape to bridge the gap until the Cool Kids' full-length debut has production from Don Cannon and guest spots from Ludacris, Bun B, and others.

Yesterday & Today,The Field,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a613d1975652138d69/1:1/w_160/3b3468d7.jpg,2009-05-28 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13142-yesterday-today/,KompaktAnti-,"As with any artist whose singular sound wins an admirable cross-section of hearts-- especially in a time when fewer niche artists are rewarded with attention from outside their scene-- it's hard to envy Axel Willner as he follows his debut, the 2007 breakoutÂ From Here We Go Sublime. Offer a complete revamp of his paradoxically mist-light-but-brick-dense mix of ambient and trance? He'd be accused of selling out his smitten fanbase. Pack Yesterday and Today with six slabs of self-parodic more-of-the-same? He could await the entitled mewling about wheel-spinning and diminishing returns. So it's unsurprising that Willner's taken the easiest route. Yesterday and Today calculatingly comprises three songs that extend the known rush of Sublime-- the barely there hissing drums; the short, soft vocal samples swept into grandly corny pastel clouds; the poignant you-call-those-melodies? abstracted from the emotionally-manipulative fakebook of post-rave cheese-- and three very different potential future directions for the Field discography. It sounds like a hesitant record, made by a man stuck between the rock of new non-DJ expectations and the hard place of an artist's desire to grow without being compromised by an audience whose needs he can only guess at. It's also quite good, despite the possible failure of nerve on its creator's part. Good or no, though, it's doubtful the new-old stuff will convince those un-seduced by Sublime. Willner's tracks are so formally simple that's it not necessarily wrong to claim that if you've heard one then you better dig a lot of edge-of-perception variations in woosh and chug to get through a whole record. But then the rickety claim that ""there may not seem to be much going on but..."" has tripped up decades' worth of critics trying to sell verse-and-chorus kids on bleeps and loops. Let's say this to the suspicious: If the sound-qua-sound of a Field track's first minute doesn't trigger near-synaesthetic glee, it's guff to promise any mind-rearranging revelations five minutes later, or even many of traditional minimalism's ""holy shit!"" moments. The length of Willner's tracks, their did-he-or-didn't-he? shifts in mood, and their easy to miss addition/subtraction of instrumentation via the volume knob suggest background music, and maybe that's the best ""in"" to the Field's world. You can certainly let the a trance-ish synth swoosh and near-inaudible plinky piano of opener ""I Have the Moon, You Have the Internet"" (a subtle advance rebuke to peanut-gallery griping?) wash over you and be satisfied. Of course that might mean you'll miss Willner's genius deployment of a single rising chord in the final minutes. And if you've been gripped by ""I Have The Moon"" for its duration? Well, there's your nape-tingling bonus. It's also not clear that the aesthetic curve balls will please Sublime partisans. Korgis cover ""Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime"" is more or less a snooze, a looped line of (gasp!) full vocal over a dapple of static-ridden soft-pop and swelling strings-and-cymbals, a pleasant diversion as the B-side remix to an indie rock single, but filler here. Better is ""Yesterday and Today"", truly tweaking Willner's trademark and suggesting the fruits of the Field's cross-genre jaunt across America, rubbing shoulders with four-man bands in our finer rock-centric ratholes. The chunky, lengthy bass-and-drums outro thankfully sounds less like punk-funk and more like a tribal DJ tool from a Masters at Work set, albeit replacing MAW's gussied-to-hell layers of horns and chants with a nostril-dilating blast of pine-scented Kompakt ambiance. But then there's the appropriately named, implacable, acid-tinged ""Sequenced"", a nostalgic cruise straight into the murky neighborhood of 1970s/80s Europe's half-remembered pioneers of O.C.D. keyboard-play as an end in itself. Despite the late introduction of a (there's sadly no other adjective) spangly melody, it's by far the darkest thing Willner's ever waxed. And though it features the album's most insistent rhythm, it's too slow for dancing, more like what a post-JDF producer would play during a casting call for his kitsch discosploitation movie. It's also the key to understanding why those who kvetch about the Field failing as ""dance music"" are missing the point. Like those repetition-happy German/French/Italian pioneers, the Field's making music more suited for passively-received images than actively moving bodies. It's impossible to tell where Willner will go from Yesterday and Today. One might hope he continues on from the title track, adding weightier rhythms and making a few no-bullshit dancefloor singles. Or you can imagine a double-disc of deep-listening mid-tempo head-nodders taking ""Sequenced"" to prog/concept extremes. Whatever the evolutionary next-step, the hope is that Wilner can keep the feel of the Sublime-ish half of Yesterday and Today without stooping to third-time's-killed-the-charm recycling or willfully denying the pleasures he can provide so easily. That's the kind of tall order that's felled artists more time-tested than the relatively young Willner, and so for now I'll just wish him luck while very much enjoying the rich mix of retreads and possibilities we've got.","The Field follows his breakout album with one that splits the difference between more of the same and new ideas.

How to Get to Heaven From Scotland,Aidan Moffat & the Best-Ofs,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a377b1335d7bf1698733/1:1/w_160/7b4acf90.jpg,2009-05-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12894-how-to-get-to-heaven-from-scotland/,Chemikal Underground,"At first, I was upset when Arab Strap broke up, but I'm beginning to think it was actually a well-disguised blessing. Both members, Malcolm Middleton and Aidan Moffat, have gone on to make music as good as their former band's-- first Middleton, on 2007's A Brighter Beat, and then Moffat on his music & poetry album I Can Hear Your Heart, and now with his new, band-ish agglomeration of musical friends, the Best-Ofs. His two principle collaborators on How to Get to Heaven From Scotland are Stevie Jones and ex-Delgado Alun Woodward, but it's an informal arrangement, and he's certainly not averse to a little light orchestration here and there. The album has a ramshackle feel befitting Moffat's creaky barroom croon, with bits of accordion, cello, woodwind, ragged electric guitar, and loud drums sharing space in the arrangements. Part of the appeal of Moffat's songwriting is that the relationships between people in his lyrics are as complicated as real life, and his trademark storminess is tempered with tenderness and humane admissions that blame is always something to be shared. Perhaps the most striking musical moment on the whole record comes on opener ""Lover's Song"", when Moffat's a cappella vocal, already interesting for the way he doubles the lyrics with a wordless back-up, is unexpectedly joined by a human beat box. There's nothing else quite as jaw-dropping, but there's plenty of great stuff, from the tense drones and dense, cooped-up atmosphere of ""A Scenic Route to the Isle of Ewe"" to the pretty, levitating ""Atheist's Lament"", a song any unreligious person can relate to, including non-atheists who just aren't into dogma. ""Oh Men!"" and ""That's Just Love"" are celebratory drinking songs, and distinctly Scottish-sounding ones at that. In fact, the Scottish character of the whole album runs a lot deeper than just Moffat's thick, pleasing brogue. Moffat always wrote about the underside of life in Arab Strap, but even at his most woe-is-me moments it never felt like a complaint. He's crawled further out into the light here than ever before, and the album comes off like a celebration of life's complications and contradictions rather than a lament for them. ""Lullaby for Unborn Child"" includes a recording of his then-unborn child's heartbeat (it sounds oddly like war drums), and one can't help but wonder if becoming a father hasn't brightened his outlook some. It's on this song that Moffat's embrace of imperfection crystalizes most vivdly: ""I can't promise you'll be happy/ But I can promise you my best.""

Rose City,Viva Voce,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43ac0084474cd0c0445/1:1/w_160/20f99b7e.jpg,2009-05-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13053-rose-city/,Barsuk,"One of the reasons people are so fascinated by husband-and-wife bands (or former-husband-and-wife bands) is that we hope that the elusive magic that keeps people together or the visceral drama that tears them apart is audible somewhere in their three-minute pop nuggets. We're hoping to be a fly on the wall of their indie rock domicile. And though those sorts of bands-- from Yo La Tengo and Low to the White Stripes and Quasi-- release wonderful music, we are rarely given an actual glimpse into the intimacy of the relationship that crafted it. Viva Voce, a Portland-via-Alabama spousal duo, is one such group. On their four previous records, Viva Voce gave us stomping stoner anthems and warmly jangling pop, all crafted with an incisive eye for melodic detail. But on their latest offering, Kevin and Anita Robinson have not only pared things down, writing and recording everything for Rose City in less than a month, but built things up as well, adding two additional members to flesh out their lineup. The result is a fresh-sounding collection that feels easy and unpretentious yet urgent, an album that is markedly different from its heavier 2006 predecessor, Get Yr Blood Sucked Out, but one that continues its organic, imaginative bent. And though its songs may not explicitly deal with life in the Robinson's marriage (sadly, there's no hit single called ""Honey, Take Out the Trash""), they definitely give voyeuristic listeners the feeling of a couple letting two new people into their insular world and offer songs that pulse with the immediacy of their off-the-cuff creation. The album opens with a surprising wallop of 1990s alt.radio rockness, as the glammy chug and reverberating riffs of ""Devotion"" call to mind both the slick pop aggression of Garbage and the theatrical guitar bravado of Jane's Addiction. It's strange to hear Viva Voce trying on a guise that is, at once, so straightforwardly rock (without any psychedelic or countrified influences) and polished to such glossy sheen. But lest you think the entire album is going to wallow in 90s nostalgia, the collection hits its stride on third track ""Octavio"", when it slows down to revel less in manic guitar pomp and more in Kevin's playful rhythms and Anita's dreamy vocals. Here, the key to Viva Voce's success-- long assumed to be Anita's guitar prowess and the interplay between the percussive husband and his melodic wife-- is her gilded coo. She has a limber voice that can wring the same sort of girlish, sassy flirtation from its cords as Jenny Lewis or Emily Haines, yet it's also adept at the sort of airy, hushed lilt that makes Chan Marshall and Feist so captivating. And given the space it deserves, her gently ethereal voice can become a track's guiding instrument, either when harmonizing with herself (as on ""Good as Gold"") or melting over the casual, deep-voiced delivery of her spouse (as on ""Midnight Sun"", the spacey, 1960s-tinged track that features the loveliest guitar melody of the entire collection). The Robinson's country-ish work as Blue Giant, another of the duo's musical projects, has obviously crept into their songwriting subconscious, coloring the western soundtrack guitars of ""Red Letter Day"" and the dusty cowpoke vibe of the surf guitars on ""Flora"". But Viva Voce smartly use such rustic touches just as flavoring, never straying too far from their gauzy rock roots. So though twangy electric guitar flourishes lurk under the warm piano vamp of ""The Slow Fade"", its repetitive descending melody-- which actually recalls an unplugged version of Nirvana's ""In Bloom""-- makes it feel more like a rock'n'roll torch song than a rootsy barnburner. Rose City, an album named for the band's adopted hometown (featuring a title track on which a homesick Anita longs for the rain and glut of bands ""in the town I love"") and recorded in the Robinson's new home studio, is the epitome of ""homemade."" And that's a good thing. Created in mere weeks, it doesn't sound fussy or fussed over, and manages the tricky balance of audible intimacy without crappy bedroom acoustics. So for anyone curious about what goes on chez Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, the answer is clear: lots of music making.","Portland husband-and-wife duo add a pair of members and pare down their songs, writing and recording this album in less than a month.

Ice Capped at Both Ends,Diamond Watch Wrists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43b9d034d5c69bf2fff/1:1/w_160/f9299aa6.jpg,2009-05-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13054-ice-capped-at-both-ends/,Warp,"Sometimes a blind first listen is best. Pinpoint the parties responsible, post-rave hero Guillermo Scott ""Prefuse 73"" Herren and drummer Zach ""Hella"" Hill, and you might expect Ice Capped at Both Ends to be a little more... antic. The latest Prefuse album, this year's Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian, took Herren's cut-and-paste computer editing to a new extreme in density. And Hella have long been a lazy namecheck for critics with a plate full of spazzy 21st century noise-punk unknowns. That pedigree would suggest an album of virtuoso digi-violence, riffs, and drums colliding and crumbling faster than your ears might care to process. Curiously enjoyable for a few surprised plays, Ice Capped drifts more than it jabs, built on low-impact, quasi-melodic drones and whispery indie rock harmonies. It may open with an agitated wash of cymbals and glitched-out voices, but ""pastoral"" is the easy-reach adjective that will likely crop up if/when the band is discussed. (Took me a few seconds after the album ended to realize the ambient bird-and-bug hum coming through my open windows wasn't some kind of unlisted outro.) As will the names of certain spectral-sounding, mimsy-voxed acts with zoology-based monikers, some of them also on Warp Records. (Naming names might be a bit cruel.) Nearly every song sounds like the edge-of-consciousness intro to another, more-uptempo album that never quite kicks in. Given my occasional weakness for the two placid streams that feed this mood music, the stoned synth-slouch of 1990s home-listening post-techno, and is-it-live-in-a-quonset-hut-or-is-it-loft-studio-fuckery? new millennium gently freaky folk-noise, this uniformity was just fine by me. Fair warning, though, if you require more oomph or variety in your full-length records. I could happily avoid real-world responsibilities with the buzzing sitar-ish background texture of ""One Second Early Late"" for quite some time. Those who've had enough of keening, multi-tracked harmonies-in-search-of-hooks and glassy more-reverb-than-guitar at a syrup-soaked 16rpm may gripe there's a hell of a lot of this stuff clogging new-release blasts at the moment. If you're burnt out, DWW is perhaps not for you. I do wish more tracks had made use of drums, like the half-speed (and then quartered again) scattered clumps of hip-hop twitches on ""Speculative Forensic Investigation"". And the gallop of ""Epedemic Episodes of Epedemics"" is a nice a reminder that art-rock-cum-electronic records can be as ""atmospheric"" as they like without sacrificing a pulse. Drowsy but not unpleasantly so, Diamond Watch Wrists' debut will certainly remind clued-in listeners of other contemporary bands capturing a certain rustic ambiance and then electronically zonking it in post-production. But its rhythm-centric moments give it a little extra jolt of personality in 2009's glut of strum-and-hum. The twisted hip-hop iconography of their name may conjure images of last-call revelry, sticky spilt drinks glinting off showpiece jewels under club lighting. But Ice Capped at Both Ends is best enjoyed in the early daytime hours, especially those humid summer mornings when time feels warmly distended, its slurred downtempo mood suiting the pace of the world as it rouses itself, sun washing over the neighborhood.","Scott Herren (Prefuse 73) and Zach Hill (Hella) team for an LP surprisingly built onÂ low-impact drones and whispery indie rock harmonies.

Dark Night of the Soul,Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e1b1335d7bf1698a7e/1:1/w_160/51c81ff0.jpg,2009-05-27 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13193-dark-night-of-the-soul/,self-released,"The Dark Night of the Soul, a term coined by the 17th century Spanish mystic Saint John of the Cross, describes a point in a pious Christian's life when they are unable to reconcile their relationship to God, and take painful steps to purify themselves. Mark Linkous-- better known as Sparklehorse-- would seem to understand something about trials and endurance. If any current performer has endured traumatic, life-altering experiences-- an early-1990s overdose that damaged his legs and almost killed him, several years in and out of states of severe depression and addiction-- while retaining an optimistic disposition, it's him. In 2005, Linkous' friends tried to pry him out of a depressed state by playing him new music. One record that struck him was Danger Mouse's The Grey Album, which led to a mutually appreciative relationship between the two artists. Danger Mouse worked on a few songs on Sparklehorse's 2006 return-to-form Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain, cutting Linkous' delicate, hermetic songs with a new type of sharpness and color. In interviews for that record, Linkous and Danger Mouse kept dropping hints at a future collaboration: maybe it would be called Dangerhorse, maybe Sparklemouse. It would be something. It ended up as Dark Night of the Soul, involving more than a dozen noteworthy musical collaborators as well as David Lynch, who signed on to create a 100-page book of original photography inspired by Linkous and Danger Mouse's music. As news leaked the buzz grew louder, and people were excited for a reason: Dark Night combined the best elements of a classic rock event with a very modern strategy. Links between the film, music, and art worlds were established, a ton of stars gathered together under the creative guidance of a couple of relative recluses, a regular old CD was marketed like a Hollywood blockbuster and packaged with a photo album for 50 bucks. Unfortunately, it's even become a ""lost album,"" as well-- the victim of a record label acting like a lawsuit-happy killjoy. In the last few weeks, it came to light that the record was being shelved due to some sort of mysterious copyright claim from EMI (who weren't too happy with Danger Mouse's first foray into recorded music, either). Danger Mouse, who has emerged as the public face of the project, issued a statement that the book would thus be issued with a blank CD, ostensibly for burning leaked copies of the album. This is one particular circumstance where a leak-- even at 160kbps-- is a net positive. This project, incomplete as it may be, is certainly worth ""possessing,"" in whatever form that takes. Linkous and Danger Mouse both have proven conclusively in the past that they know how to choose collaborators, and Dark Night is a well-sequenced and unique album that ingeniously balances its contributors' strengths with the overall theme of the work-- self-examination, often under stark circumstances, in the interest of understanding one's own existence. It's not signaled outright, but Dark Night comprises four sections, and plays like a revue. Linkous has always feared putting himself out there too much, and seeming too ""pop."" It makes sense that he'd open this collection with a triptych from Wayne Coyne, Gruff Rhys, and Jason Lytle, all of whom frequently sing in Linkous-like registers shot through with delicate, boyish wonder and play with psychedelia in similarly rewarding ways. On ""Revenge"", Coyne works in a wheelhouse he's not seen since The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi, evangelizing, ""Once we become/ The thing we dread/ There's no way to stop,"" in the form of a plangent ballad. For his part, Gruff Rhys works best at the level of empire, and the fuzzy psych-country of ""Just War"" could fit nicely on Phantom Power. As is his manner, Lytle's ""Jaykub"" traces an everyday schlub's dream of receiving official awards for simply being himself-- until the alarm clock wakes him up. The middle two sections of the record are its weakest, but there are rewards all the same. Julian Casablancas' ""Little Girl"" opens what could be dubbed the ""punk"" section, his slick insouciance sounding strangely out of place eight years after Is This It, at a time when punk vocal styles have largely trended toward the amateurish and overdriven. Regardless, he's able to effectively register his everyday/macho character, nonchalantly singing in front needly guitars (and a rock solo!). It's followed by Frank Black's ""Angel's Harp"", one of the more forced-feeling cuts, and then Iggy Pop's ""Pain"", on which he ramps up his best, darkest croon, looking back at his life with a mix of regret and pride. The guitars on Pop's piece are strikingly reminiscent of those on the Magazine song ""Shot By Both Sides"", which is noteworthy because Real Life was re-released in 2007 by, you guessed it, EMI. The guitars are too crucial to the piece to lose, and Iggy's too big of a name to drop from this collection. Perhaps ""Pain"" is the reason for the forced abandonment of this whole thing? Either way, Dark Night shifts again after ""Pain"" to its second psychedelic section, featuring David Lynch himself, another Lytle number, ""Everytime I'm With You"", on which he is completely resigned to just hanging out and getting resoundingly fucked up, and James Mercer. Lynch's ""Star Eyes (I Can Catch It)"" is a piece of muddy string-laden psychedelia, but Mercer's effort, the wonderfully titled ""Insane Lullaby"", is one of the finest moments on the album. Turns out that Mercer is as much a doppelganger for Linkous as Lytle, Coyne, and Rhys, and his cadence and vocal inflections are situated amidst a gently stunning cacophony of glitches, bells, and strings. He sounds like he's lost, but he also sounds like he's loving it. Dark Night's best sequence is its last one, when Linkous reunites himself with Nina Persson, formerly of the Cardigans, and singer/songwriter Vic Chesnutt (both guested on the 2001 Sparklehorse LP Its Wonderful Life). Persson and Linkous split vocal duties on the country-tinged number ""Daddy's Gone"", the lovely, sentimental sort of ""pop"" that Linkous has always seemed so afraid of, yet is also exceedingly, seemingly effortlessly, capable of making. Chesnutt finishes the record with ""Grim Augury"", which, along with the Lynch-feauring title track, is a fitting one-two punch of rural eccentricity that allows Linkous to reengage with the woodshed hermit side of his musical persona. Dark Night of the Soul has been pitched as a marquee collaboration without precedent, which makes the mundane EMI copyright baloney that scrapped the project all the more depressing. But while Danger Mouse, Lynch, and the dozen or so artists involved with the project contributed their talents, the feeling I get from Dark Night is all Linkous. In genre terms-- punk rock, country, schizophrenic folk, psychedelia, space-rock-- the album neatly indexes his own discography as much as the overriding thematics do. It's fitting, then, that an artist who is on one hand so admittedly fearful of performance, and on the other has such a knack for collaboration, would make an album such as this, on which a group of musical actors present his work while he stands off to the side in the shadows.","Derailed by a murky copyright claim, Dark Night of the Soul is worth tracking down. Among the many guests are Wayne Coyne, Gruff Rhys, and James Mercer.

Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix,Phoenix,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4399d034d5c69bf2ff8/1:1/w_160/7c2352e4.jpg,2009-05-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13052-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix/,GlassnoteLoyautÃ©,"At one point in the schlocky 1975 musical comedy Lisztomania, Roger Daltrey whips out an absurdly large phallus and no less than five women simultaneously straddle it like a cannon. It's as insane as it sounds. In the movie, Daltrey plays Franz Liszt, the 19th century Hungarian pianist and composer known for his flamboyant playing style-- hysterical women fought over his handkerchiefs at concerts more than a century before the Beatles. Whereas Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music represented all things respectable and classicist, Liszt was a Romantic hero full of flash; Amadeus won eight Oscars, Lisztomania boasts lines like, ""Your big ambition was to stick your working-class cock up a piece of high-class crumpet."" With their fourth album, Phoenix reference both composers and hone in on an elusive target somewhere between Mozart's formal wonders and Listz's dramatic flair. While the album's 10 songs are arranged and executed with virtuoso pop-rock precision, they chronicle nothing but angst, confusion, disappointment, and despair. It's truly universal-- everybody live, love, and die. Much of the album's internal conflict is laid out in its first couple lines. ""So sentimental; not sentimental, no!/ Romantic; not disgusting yet,"" sings frontman Thomas Mars on opener ""Lisztomania"", sounding like a madman with two tiny creatures whispering into each ear. Mars keeps this treacherous divide in mind throughout Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, and the rest of the record successfully avoids mush while keeping its beating heart intact. And the issue of thematic directness is especially important to Phoenix-- this is an established indie band writing songs about love that are armed with hooks primed for a mainstream embrace. Just listen to the invincible crescendo of Wolfgang's ""Countdown""-- especially that little Coldplay-esque piano twinkle about three and a half minutes in-- and realize that these guys are a few Chris Martin-isms away from staggering ubiquity. They're a bona fide ""should be bigger"" band. But, as their songs tighten into increasingly effective bursts of pop, Mars is breaking up his words and meanings into smaller and smaller fragments. His isn't a self-congratulatory, indie-nerd triumph, though, i.e., Mars isn't being cryptic to be an asshole. He's getting better and more sophisticated as his band discards anything-- an outro, a bridge, an extra hi-hat hit-- that could be deemed superfluous. Sure: YouTube tells us this album will make a generation-spanning touchstone like The Breakfast Club that much better. It'll also hit your gut if you listen hard enough. There are layers here-- maybe too many layers for the biggest rooms. ""I feel too young,"" went the hook on Phoenix's innocent and bittersweet 2000 debut single. Back then, the quartet was following a wave of Gallic cool led by friends Daft Punk and Air. Nearly 10 years on and this casually chic group has grown into something unique-- Wolfgang isn't a tweaked Air record or a tweaked Strokes record as much as it's a Phoenix record. Gone is the sometimes-flimsy blue-eyed soul of their first two LPs, replaced with a glossier take on the uptick guitars and sampled snare snaps of 2006's brilliant It's Never Been Like That. And they're not feeling so young anymore, either. ""Do you remember when 21 years was old?"" muses Mars on ""Countdown"". Growing up, looking back, and peeking ahead usually isn't this enjoyable. Its unflappable sonic sheen gives Wolfgang some winsome 80s nostalgia, but smart modern touches-- a constant near-Auto-Tune vocal effect, Justice-lite keyboard stabs on ""1901""-- ensure its of-the-moment-ness. Meanwhile, Mars hints at a time and space where he's everywhere-- or nowhere-- all at once. ""Acres/ Visible horizon/ Right where it starts and ends/ When did we start the end?"" he wonders aloud at the end of the krautrocking epic ""Love Is a Sunset"", just after the song has blasted into a stratosphere where a diminishing horizon line is the only clear thing in sight. ""Rome"" likens a collapsing relationship to a collapsed empire; ""2000 years remain in a trash can."" And, on ""Countdown"", Mars' ennui reaches its peak as he sings, ""True and everlasting didn't last that long."" But he's not sad-sacking along, head down, no umbrella. He's pumped. Excited. With the band going full-bore behind him, he concludes the most ebullient song about existential inevitability in recent memory with an impassioned rallying cry: ""We're the lonesome! We're the lonesome!"" All together now. At another point in Lisztomania, Roger Daltrey's entire body is sucked into a devilish princess' underthings. (Seriously.) Before that happens, though, the cigar-chomping heiress quotes Oscar Wilde while explaining her unladylike smoking habit, ""It's the perfect form of pleasure, it's exquisite and leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one ask?"" Phoenix seem to understand this line of thinking-- and not just because they look like a group of guys who know their Gauloises. They're pleasure-pushers, filling tunes with riffs, phrases, and beats a five-year-old could love. But, on Wolfgang, those same songs are unfulfilled-- and this band wouldn't have it any other way. There's beauty in a sunset. Phoenix are wringing it out.","Nearly 10 years into its career, the underrated French band has honed its sleek and increasingly effective bursts of pop to a fine point.

Wild and Inside,Eat Skull,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43813d1975652138c75/1:1/w_160/94a16db5.jpg,2009-05-26 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13051-wild-and-inside/,Siltbreeze,"Portland-based Eat Skull debuted in 2008 with Sick to Death, a noise-pop record heavy on noise and light on pop, scuzzier and more feedback-driven than just about anything else that could be grouped into its subgenre. Over the past year, noise-pop has seen a vast resurgence, growing in popularity in ways most of us didn't anticipate. And with so many of this year's most talked-about artists (Wavves, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, and others) adding varying degrees of murk to pop melodies, it's getting harder to separate the wheat from the chaff. Though they've toned down their approach ever so slightly with sophomore LP Wild and Inside, Eat Skull remains the scuzziest of all, and shows us here why they're still one of the most intriguing acts operating in this style. To say that Wild and Inside soundsÂ ""clean""Â would be a stretch, but what's immediately noticeable here is the album's lack of excessive noise, the squeals and screeches that dominated so much of Sick to Death. Eat Skull (and frontman Rob Enbom, in particular) seem to have matured as songwriters and they're more capable of using noise as a tool, another instrument, rather than relying on it as the sole foundation for their material. That much is clear on the record's decidedly poppy front- and back-ends. Stellar openerÂ ""Stick to the Formula""Â and neighboringÂ ""Heaven's Stranger""Â strike a fine balance between 1960s garage-rock and the sugariness of early Flying Nun acts the Clean and the Chills, adding a uniquely crusty, folksier quality that lends the songs distinctiveness. This shift towards pop (and again, that's a relative term here) gives the band more room to breathe. It lets them tinker with other styles, too, and most of this experimenting takes place in the record's quirky midsection. Eat Skull daringly ventures into a stretch of haunted Americana here and manages to pull it off; they wind up sounding like a spookier version of fellow lo-fi crusties Woods-- not a bad thing. Unexpected detours really open up on third or fourth listen (Wild and Inside is undoubtedly a grower); tracks such as the funerealÂ ""Talkin'Â Bro in the Wall Blues""Â display a welcome adventurousness not found on Sick to Death. Similarly surprising (and appealing) is the ominous coastal instrumentalÂ ""Surfing the Stairs""Â andÂ ""Happy Submarine"", which plays like a psych-garage reimagining of Grouper's from-the-bottom-of-a-well shoegaze. Just a few patches of Wild and Inside aren't as successful. It's hard to imagine many folks loving the minimal dirgeÂ ""You're With a Thing"", which subsists mostly on a simple drum-machine beat and organ squelches. And other times Eat Skull's penchant for quirkiness borders on kitsch, like onÂ ""Cooking Our Way to Be Happy"", a track about, well, cooking. (A cute song, sure, but lacking the staying power of catchy late-album standoutsÂ ""Dawn in the Face""Â andÂ ""Oregon Dreaming"".) Such lapses are few and far between, though, and shouldn't spoil much one's enjoyment of the album. The real question, I suppose, is whether or not listeners will give this record the room it needs to develop, or if kids new to this wave ofÂ noise-pop will make the jump to Eat Skull's much weirder sub-strain. It's hard to say: We Twitter-era fans are generally a pretty fatigued and impatient bunch. Those who do carve out some time for Wild and Inside, though, are likely in for a treat.","Though they've toned down a bit on their second LP, Eat Skull are still among the scuzziest, and best, of the recent crop of noise-pop bands.

Cryptomnesia,El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41fea9e61561daa4e1e/1:1/w_160/696b18dd.jpg,2009-05-26 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13031-cryptomnesia/,self-released,"The Mars Volta, at both their best and their worst, often sound like several different bands going in several different directions at once. But love them or hate them, no one could ever fairly accuse the group of caving in to critics and abandoning their mission. Indeed, the Mars Volta's main drivers, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, are like id-mobiles stuck permanently in high gear; they'd rather hit a brick wall head on than back up or turn around, to hell with anyone that would suggest otherwise. Even so, the last thing the ADHD-inclined group would appear to need is another distraction. But apparently Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's scattershot ideas and energies can't be contained in, let alone sated by, one band alone. Since the inception of the Mars Volta, he's kept himself busy with any number of collaborations and side projects, working with such fellow travelers as Lydia Lunch, Damo Suzuki, and Chili Pepper John Frusciante, and releasing a never-ending stream of discs under his own name as well as the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quintet. El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, as the name implies, is the newest Omar Rodriguez-Lopez project, except that it's really not that new. El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez began back in 2006 when Omar Rodriguez-Lopez hooked up with Hella drummer Zach Hill but has since evolved to include fellow Hella member Jonathan Hischke as well as other members of the Mars Volta, including vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala. For fans of both the Mars Volta and Hella, one imagines news of the collaboration portended the ultimate meeting of the out-of-their-minds. That Cryptomnesia sounds more or less exactly like the sum of its parts should shock no one. The first publicly released product of the Mars Volta/Hella collision (with supposedly at least two other completed recordings waiting in the wings), Cryptomnesia features about 36 minutes of Rodriguez-Lopez's trademark guitar ejaculations, supported by Hill's thundering, hyperactive drums, with Bixler-Zavala's histrionic vocals piercing the din on nine of the 11 tracks. On the plus side, the bulk of the tracks barely reach the four-minute mark, tempering Rodriguez-Lopez's tendency to wank around until he runs out of time or tape (whichever comes first). A few songs, such as ""Half Kleptos"" and ""Paper Cunts"", even attain some semblance of a groove. Yet between all the samples of dialog interspersed throughout the disc and film-referencing song titles such as ""Noir"", ""They're Coming to Get You, Barbara"", and ""Warren Oates"", the album recalls less the prog dinosaurs that the Mars Volta are always compared to and more John Zorn's crazed hardcore cartoon jazz outfit Naked City. Except Naked City at least had a sense of humor and kept the changes coming so fast and furious it was easy to get caught up in the frantic nature of it all. El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, on the other hand, don't favor such concision, and, breaks between outbursts such as the aforementioned ""Cunts"", ""Elderly Pair Beaten With Hammer"", and ""Warren Oates"" aside, they essentially amount to variations on the same song, one long suite that might as well be a single track. Admittedly, one man's indulgence is another man's ambition, but not only does it sound at this point as if Rodriguez-Lopez can barf out stuff like this in his sleep, but at his rate of productivity he may be doing just that. Awe is in the ear of the beholder, sure, but after being predictably pounded into the ground for half an hour by Rodriguez-Lopez/Hill et al. and their bag of heavy tricks, it's hard to tell if we're meant to walk away impressed or oppressed.","First official release of new project from Mars Volta guitarist features two members of Hella and members of MV, including Cedric Bixler-Zavala.

Eating Us,Black Moth Super Rainbow,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a435ea9e61561daa4e5b/1:1/w_160/d6b12961.jpg,2009-05-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13048-eating-us/,Graveface,"Black Moth Super Rainbow are a dream for fans of weird and offbeat music: They've always seemed more a ""collective"" than proper band, trading on the whims of unknown numbers of masked and aliased folks. They have their own typeface, side projects (frontman Tobacco's 2008 album Fucked Up Friends), split EPs, and an enclave (Pittsburgh). Yet nowÂ Eating Us, the band's fourth album, emerging from undisclosed Pennsylvania woodland recording sessions to roost in producer Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios, the band's first professional recording experience.Â The result is a crisper, more linear sound that, somewhat surprisingly, places substantial emphasis on the band's songwriting. Whether a conscious choice or a byproduct of Fridmann's noted, um, flattening tendencies, Eating Us is less reliant on the analog bass rumble featured prominently on Dandelion Gum. The beats, while still machinated and tweaked, seem more attuned to rock norms, popping reliably on the 2s and 4s. Analog-y synth noise still gobbles space, but the filters and oscillators no longer wild off in strange directions; they are musical instruments, making music. The vocals still exclusively feature vocoder effects, but the sugar-swamp flow is less molasses, more maple syrup. The lyrics are still rightly fucked-- ""Iron lemonade/ Wash my friends away/ Na, na na na na na""-- but they're mostly decipherable. These aren't necessarily backward steps: Album opener ""Born on a Day the Sun Didn't Rise""-- possibly the first linear BMSR song-- moves like an Elephant 6 track. Choppy, descending chords, boxy drums, and citric acid-vocals push toward a bridge featuring, of all things, a string section. The industrial distortion that congeals near the end of ""Iron Lemonade"" has guitar lines wrapped around it like yarn, and the whole song benefits from its taut, careful groove. A banjo lopes throughout ""American Face Dust""; ""Twin of Myself"" might have a real chorus. BMSR are still appropriately weird-- ""Wash my friends away"" is a request. But they're also gentler, more coherent. Close your eyes and place ""Twin of Myself"" against any of the songs you might have forgotten from At War With the Mystics. The gentle sighs and acoustic guitars of ""Bubblegum Animals"" and ""Fields Are Breathing"" feel pastoral, a label that seems slight in the shadow of BMSR's forest-groove madness. Songs tend to be followed by... more songs, and not the rippling Moog-fevers that often threatened Dandelion Gum (there is no ""Caterpillar House"", no ""Rollerdisco""). Damn if ""Gold Splatter"", at four-plus minutes and the recipient of a string outro, doesn't just feel long. Dandelion Gum exhibited the sort of singular style that incites folks to think, about its creators, that they could make records like this for the rest of their career. But maybe not; Dandelion Gum was speckled and silly and high as shit. Eating Us feels more like the baseline: collected, repeatable, respectable. You know, regular, at least to the point that melting faces and ""fucked-up dreams"" can be regular.","For their fourth album, this PA collective travels east to enlist the help ofÂ producer Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lis, Mercury Rev).

UGK 4 Life,UGK,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4549d034d5c69bf3041/1:1/w_160/1e27f8ed.jpg,2009-05-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13073-ugk-4-life/,Jive,"""Back from the dead."" Delivered by Pimp C, these are among the first words you hear on UGK 4 Life, and unfortunately, it's a sentiment delivered way less metaphorically than we're used to. Lives are cut short with a sad frequency in hip-hop, but Pimp C's early death was something of an anomaly: too often, ascendant talents are snuffed out before we get a full glimpse of their capabilities. But by 2007, UGK had become something like Houston's answer to Gang Starr, a partnership that thrived on consistency and longevity while their peer groups either broke up, soldiered on in an unknowable format, or just fell the fuck off completely (I'm looking at you 8Ball & MJG). So, yeah-- UGK 4 Life doesn't dwell a whole lot on what the future holds in large part because it's so steeped in the craft they took years to perfect. Though it lacks something as jump-off-the-screen as ""Int'l Players Anthem"" and the feel-good momentousness of a #1 debut on Billboard, it also lacks double-album stuffing filler. Though probably not the best UGK album, it might be the strongest illustration of what they do best. As with most of their material, the vast majority of the UGK 4 Life's action takes place behind a woodgrain wheel, in the vicinity of a pistol, or inside various female orifices, with only the incredibly ill-advised Akon spot about erectile function (""Hard as Hell"") to fuck up the flow. Of course, there are still plenty State of the Streets sermons, as ""Purse Come First"" makes the latent political awareness in Bun B's raps come to the forefront (""it's a new world order, at least that's what I read""). But even if Pimp C opened up about his image (""I look like this, I don't talk it/ I make 'em think I'm dumb""), he still ended his verse with a blowjob joke. While UGK's albums have always delivered, I never quite shared the opinion that they're godbody MC's. For me, there's not enough clever wordplay and not enough detailed storytelling-- basically that whole East Coast bias bullshit. But maybe due to the proliferation of Kanye-jacking newbies who used to rap and now wanna sing, I've come to appreciate UGK as having two of the best voices in hip-hop. It's a dynamic that's been explored over-and-over-- the deeper, more methodical cadence balancing out the nasal loose cannon. Bun B's performance is a masterwork of nuance here, sounding doubled even when it's obvious he's not. His oaken, sturdy intonations give authority to anything he's saying, whether introspective (""The Pimp and the Bun"") or just stuck on the same ol' bullshit (just about everything else). As for Pimp C, it's easy to point out that nearly all of his metaphors on this record are food-based and related to him getting his dick sucked, but he remains untouched in terms of delivering hooks and his mere accent can still be the highlight of any track. Just check ""She Luv It"" for the incomprehensible pronunciation of ""barbecue rib,"" wherein the former word has fewer syllables than the latter, or the entirety of ""Everybody Wanna Ball"", where he takes an obvious line and flips into a spirited performance on his own terms. There's also a nice ""Eh, why not?"" feel to the guest list: there's Akon, Ronald Isley, B-Legit, and E-40, but also Snoop and Too $hort (guess what the song they're on is about) and even commercial non-starters like Big Gipp. The common thread through all of them here is that they're all on UGK territory, and they don't get beats so much as music, steaming organ trills and wah-wah guitar filling out the backdrop and rendering even the most smutty material sultry. The delightfully nasty ""She Luv It"" could even be a hit if it didn't begin with Pimp C trying ""to fit [my] whole dick and nuts inside your mooooouth"" and end with his advice on female grooming. Same for ""Harry Asshole"", which raises the question of how it could be filthier than its title and answers with ""feat. Lil' Boosie and Webbie."" Is it weird for UGK 4 Life to make pretty much no mention whatsoever of the fact that half of the rapping is done by someone who died a year and a half before its release? A little-- Sleepy Brown gets himself off the milk carton to propose a toast to Pimp during the ice-grilled rumination of ""Swishas & Erb"" (possibly a nod to OutKast's similar-sounding ""Crumblin' Erb""), and only then do you realize it's the only Bun B solo performance on the whole thing. But UGK never seemed like the type to buy into a whole lot of self-mythologizing, maudlin or otherwise. You'd expect something of that sort from the penultimate ""Da Game Been Good to Me"", but instead it might as well be subtitled ""But Not to You"", as Pimp and Bun talk down rappers who failed to respect the game like they did. It makes sense: As long as there's grain to be gripped, lanes to be switched, and, for better or worse, way too many words that rhyme with ""bitch,"" UGK's music remains timeless in its own way.","Mostly recorded before Pimp C passed away in 2007, the final UGK album is steeped in the craft the duo took years to perfect.

Veckatimest,Grizzly Bear,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4535e6ef9596932084e/1:1/w_160/e8c5fabf.jpg,2009-05-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/,Warp,"Veckatimest ain't perfect; lord knows it tries. More than most any album in recent memory not named Chinese Democracy (please keep reading), it is compositionally and sonically airtight, every moment sounding tweaked, labored over. Perfection-- and the pursuit thereof-- has its price, and in less able hands (with all love to Axl), this obsessive attention to craft and execution could lead to something dull. What's perhaps the most remarkable thing about the truly remarkable Veckatimest, however, is how very exciting much of it is; no small feat for a painstaking chamber-pop record that never once veers above the middle tempo. 2007's Friend EP had me worried that Grizzly Bear's insistence on having everything in its right place had forced formula onto what had seemed to that point freewheeling and free-associative. For every inspired moment on Friend, there was another that fell back on the tried-but-true: a quiet intro bleeding into a big, harmonic midsection followed by an eventual denouement. That sound characterized a few of the better tunes on 2006'sÂ Yellow House-- and a fair bit of what little Grizzly Bear has released since. That said,Â we've had no shortage of Grizzly Bear-related music: Dan Rossen's recently resuscitated Department of Eagles made a pretty great record last year, Chris Taylor's done some stellar production work with Dirty Projectors and Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson, and the band proper have lined up onstage collaborations with high-minded sorts like Nico Muhly and the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In Veckatimest, one sees the fruit of that variegated labor as well; between records, these dudes have been busy getting better at all the things they do, and as it turns out, Veckatimest manages to do Yellow House at least a few better on nearly every metric. First, the songs. By now, many of you should be familiar with the stunning bounce of ""Two Weeks"", the skyward swoon of teen creeper ""Cheerleader"", and the surefooted shuffle of ""While You Wait for the Others"". (In fact, I'm painfully aware you may just be intimately familiar with the whole damn thing. If that's you, listen good: that windtunnel 128k leak you nabbed that fateful night back in March? That is not Veckatimest. Get thee to a buying place.) Highlights, all, but there's more where that came from. The fluttering opener ""Southern Point"" takes off and circles back like a flock of birds, as inviting as Yellow House's ""Easier"" and a whole lot more to the point. The Rossen-sung ""All We Ask"" does the Rossen thing, starting soft and slow before exploding around the halfway mark, but it does it as well as or better than anything we've heard from him before. The record's final stretch, from ""While You Wait"" through the head-swimmer ""I Live With You"" to the masterful, muted ""Foreground"" closesÂ Veckatimest on three very strong notes. But this is Grizzly Bear, and despite an increased confidence in their pop sensibilities and an overall strengthening of melodies, they're still meanderers at heart. Highlights abound, but Veckatimest does sound as though it was conceived as a whole piece, and one must consider both the overall structure and the connective tissue between the abundant highlights to judge itÂ a success. Save ""Cheerleader"" and the lilting ""Ready, Able"", the stretch between ""Fine for Now"" and ""While You Wait"" wanders a bit; certain moments, like Rossen's ""swim around like two dories"" line and the wispy, wheezing ""About Face"", hit harder than others. But you'll be looking for a while to find anybody who thinks the center of Veckatimest is as strong as the stuff surrounding it. Beyond irking folks predisposed to slagging off intricate and, yeah, ""sophisticated"" music like this-- you stay punk, I'mma stay fascinated-- this trip down yonder to the minor key will doubtless be the big complaint about Veckatimest. But really, couldn't we say the same aboutÂ Yellow House? I mean, there's some jam in between ""Knife"" and ""On a Neck, On a Spit"", but there's an awful lot of wide-open spaces and deliberate left turns in there, too. Yellow House was not a record defined so much by its two or three big numbers as it was by the slightly haunting impression it left when you played it front to back; it sounded deconstructed, whereas Veckatimest feels built brick-by-brick. As I mentioned, Veckatimest handily beats Yellow House in the bangers department, and while you're not gonna hear ""Two Weeks"" on any radio station that isn't already playing Ted Leo, there is something prim and proper about the record. Yet the pop moments on Veckatimest feel even bigger after the slight deviation at its core; surrounded by a few sour notes and sidesteps, ""Cheerleader"" and ""Ready, Able"" becomes that much stronger, and even the less effective numbers (""Hold Still"", ""Fine for Now"") seem only to cower a smidge as a result of the staggering heights they're placed next to. Out of context, they're every bit as good as the more sinewy stuff that wove Yellow House together. I walked into Grizzly Bear's much-lauded set at the church down at SXSW this year a skeptic and came out a convert; I knew what a powerful live band they could be, having seen 'em twice before, but my fear about flatlining and my initial (and incorrect) impressions based on the Veckatimest leak had me convinced I'd get my ""Knife"" and my ""Two Weeks"" and then perhaps a very welcome nap. What I got instead was as great a testament to band democracy as I've seen onstage; these new tunes require a terrific amount of concentration and skill to pull off in that setting, and any band whose sprightliest number (""On a Neck"", still) sounds like half a ragtime had to work awfully hard to win me over after I'd spent the prior eight hours replacing beer-sweat with more beer. Yeah, Veckatimest sounds worked-over, but in the best of ways; carefully embellished, stripped bare when applicable, full of the joy of sounds colliding with other sounds. Grizzly Bear was once Ed Droste's band, but no longer; it's a family affair, and only four guys so completely serious about music-making could come together to make an album this labor-intensive sound so airy, so natural. I get it; Grizzly Bear can come across to some as boring. Lord knows I could go my whole life never reading another Ed Droste Tweet about pho or seeing Chris Taylor use a neti pot. But this little microcosm of imperfection indie rock's been working through lately could use a foil like Veckatimest, a record that, in searching for perfection through meticulousness, feels beautifully flawed and gloriously off-kilter without either side serving as the entire narrative. Really, in a world far too concerned with backstories and far too lacking in good old dedication to craft, Grizzly Bear's just about as boring as they come: four guys who very quietly set out to make a fantastic record. And so they did.","One of the year's most anticipated albums turns out to be worthy of the hype, as Grizzly Bear continue to expand their approach to lush chamber pop.

La Llama,Savath y Savalas,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41b5e6ef959693207cb/1:1/w_160/cde7ecb4.jpg,2009-05-22 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13028-la-llama/,Stones Throw,"What does it mean to say that you are a Scott Herren fan? In over a decade of painterly sonic experiment, bouncing from name to name, style to style, he has fashioned such a colorful body of work that even the artist himself warns against drawing connections and comparisons. Because he doesn't want to diminish his collaborators' roles, he approaches each project-- there are no ""side projects"" to him-- on its own terms and asks listeners to follow suit. This year alone, Herren's mark can be found on three new records: one under his high-tech Prefuse 73 moniker, another that pairs him up with Zach Hill, and, here, a return to his kindler, gentler early work as Savath y Savalas. A partnership with Eva Puyuelo Muns since 2004, the outfit has recently welcomed beat-sculptor Roberto Carlos Lange, the son of Ecuadorean immigrants, into the fold. And the result is La Llama. Expanded to a trio, S&S have changed in ways you might not expect. Of course, there is a thickening of the mix, but it owes more to the group's new methods than to the adding of a third voice or instrument. Swirls of psychedelic haze, and not only the crisp folk heard on Apropa't (2004), lend La Llama its grainy-footage aura, a sort of blissful density that fogs up each track. While part of that creamier texture is rooted in South American acid-folk-- more on that later-- another part comes from the ragtag recording. Warmly hued, dust-flecked, intimate, it isn't hard to believe the trio put this record together in a downtown apartment. The opener, which seems to cut and paste strips of the everyday ambiance seeping into his window, hints at the warm DIY production to follow. Tinny collisions of sound, the stalled construction projects around the Bowery may serve as metaphors, depending on your mood, for the faceplanting of high finance or simply for the relentless self-fashioning of Scott Herren. Certainly its collage-like quality reflects the melting pots that, over the years, he has labored to embody in musical form, from the Iberian diaspora's origin point, to the African enclaves of northern Brazil, back to his room in the immigrant mecca of New York. Not only is this the group's first non-studio effort, but it also serves as its debut on Stones Throw. With their yen for leftfield tunes that fall within, or just beyond, the bounds of hip hop, the label that has housed both upstarts like Koushik and stalwarts like J Dilla makes a neat fit for the soulful adventurousness of Savath y Savalas. In fact, it seemed to be a match made in crate-digger heaven. The general manager at Stones Throw, the NPR funk archeologist Egon, shares Herren's love for the scene in Recife, Brazil in the mid-1970s. For many, that may not ring a bell. Luckily, reissues-- most by the vital Time-Lag Records-- have helped to reassemble a crude picture of this cauldron of psychedelia, with three records standing out as the towering documents of the subculture that gathered around Lula Cortes. There is the summery acousticism of Flaviola E O Bando Do Sol's self-titled record, the overdriven hymn to the four elements, PaÃªbiru, and Satwa's suite of starlit protest ragas. But apart from the ubiquitous guitar-- strummed and picked here, sliced and diced there-- the outsize personality of Recife is tough to spot. Herren has explicitly said that the region exerts a ""direct and indirect influence,"" just one ingredient among many, but as the record beats on, one wishes that Brazilian muscle, verve, and eccentricity left a bigger mark on La Llama's mostly safe and Starbucks-ready aesthetic. Instead of a jolt of funky Brazilian mysticism, what we witness in the record is a simpler and surprisingly fluid evolution: a handful of strands from Herren's past work woven together. Not every strand was worth his effort, though. For one, the shift in Apropa't, the sophomore effort that hipped devotees to Muns' feather-light delivery, continues here with the chanteuse's return to the fore. But her contributions add little color to the songs, as her airy monotone tends to stick to a mechanical, lullaby delivery, revealing her razor-thin range on ""Barceloneta"" and amid the sleepy strums of ""Pavo Real"". On the other hand, that record's often soothing blend of Catalan folk and Chicago post-rock lives on, far more vividly, in the billowing ""Me Voy"" and the brooding guitars of ""No Despierta"". Though La Llama never plants itself on a bed of breakbeats, at its best, it does revisit the hopscotch editing of Herren's Prefuse 73 work. It is an attitude toward composing that also guided his essentially instrumental Savath debut as well as 2004's MaÃ±ana. And this persistence of the adventurous, anxious side of Herren (arrayed against his rustically downtempo Apropa't/Golden Pollen side) seems to coincide with the arrival of Roberto Carlos Lange, a musician who cut his teeth in the late-night peÃ±as of Miami before crafting backcloths to gallery installations, and whose avant-garde spirit can be felt on the best tracks. From the flutter and fuzz of ""Carajillo"", the Verocai-via-Varese frenzy of ""Una Cura"", or the spooky animalism of ""Pajaros en Cadaques"", one thing is clear. A good deal more Lange and a good deal less Muns would have brought out the best in Scott Herren.","Expanded to a trio, Scott Herren's S&S moves to Stones Throw, thickens his music's mix, and revels in the sounds from the melting pot of 1970s Brazil.

"Still Night, Still Light",Au Revoir Simone,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fdc0084474cd0c03ca/1:1/w_160/fce55262.jpg,2009-05-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13000-still-night-still-light/,Moshi Moshi,"When it comes to decorum, Brooklyn's Au Revoir Simone makes Judith Martin look like Don Rickles. They have three voices, three keyboards, and a drum machine in their arsenal, yet each element stands out from the gleaming propulsion with razored precision, as if the band were constantly saying, ""No, after you."" They deliver inspirational-kitten-calendar platitudes that would make Whitney Houston blush with disarming directness, their plain yet dulcet voices arranged in fussy group harmony-- excessive melisma being, after all, simply immodest. The band's egalitarian and mutually supportive dynamic pays off on the harmonious Still Night, Still Light, their third and best album. It's feather-light electro-pop that's not to be taken lightly. As always, the music is utterly innocent of abrasion, dissonance, and chance-- everything is clamped down so tightly that the unstinting pertness seems neurotic; the insistence on letting go, moving on, and being who you are a ""doth protest too much"" kind of thing. You start to wonder what sort of roiling emotional bedlam all of this chipper well-being is keeping at bay. Yet the starchy sincerity keeps things merrily ambiguous, and politeness saturates the lyrics as well as the music. ""Only You Can Make You Happy"" feels like stumbling into the daily affirmation part of a group-therapy session, were it sung in a melting madrigal over lazily scudding synthesizers. The contrast between goopy sentiments and rigorous music is one thing that makes Au Revoir Simone unique, but their take on the break-up song is of even greater interest. They hospice their own love affairs with tenderness and grace, thereby avoiding the garden varieties-- vindictive, triumphant, pathetic, unilateral-- of the form. They strive for consensus in ""let's discuss this reasonably until we both agree to break up in a loving and supportive fashion"" songs, and achieve some of their sharpest lyrics in this mode. On ""Shadows"", they sing, ""I'm moving on/ I hope you're coming with me/ Because I'm not strong without you."" Come with me by going away, help me be strong enough to leave you-- it's a crafty illustration of romantic intractability. Despite their veneer of cunning naÃ¯vetÃ©, there is much more to Au Revoir Simone than rudimentary keyboards and adorable pigtails. ""All or Nothing"", a chiming bedtime anthem about getting drunk in taxicabs, supports the notion that the group's studied banality is less of a worldview than a wish. They're still turning out ditties of piercing simplicity-- ""The Last One"" and ""Take Me As I Am"" could be transcribed for a baby's mobile with little loss of effect-- but there are also svelte keyboards in deft counterpoint on ""Knight of Wands"" and carefully contrasted bright and matte tones in the riff of ""Only You Can Make You Happy"". The songs move with lathed elegance from skeletal to bursting and back again. The clichÃ©s arrive at a breathtaking clip, imbued not with the melodrama of pop theater, but the earnest intimacy of a friend murmuring in your ear.","This Brooklyn trio's third LP is also its best--Â feather-light electro-pop that's not to be taken lightly.

OK Bear,Jeremy Enigk,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ebb1335d7bf1698832/1:1/w_160/4f8b88fb.jpg,2009-05-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12984-ok-bear/,Lewis HollowCydonia,"The unique power of music is to give meaning to that which has no inherent meaning. A note, on its own, is just a sound. Same with a chord or the smack of a drum stick on a snare. But by organizing those sounds, music can give them incredible power, and it can do the same for words and phrases. OK Bear, Jeremy Enigk's third solo album and second since the break-up of his band Sunny Day Real Estate, offers quite a few examples of this phenomenon, making melodic sense out of puzzling couplets like ""Crimson angel/ I live and plant there still"" and ""Morning arise/ Traced by surprise/ In an ocean wind the waves are lost."" I'm not saying his lyrics are senseless on paper-- there's inherent power in a phrase such as ""They got it all, but they ain't got emotion""-- but I am saying this album lives or dies on Enigk's ability to weave a bunch of disjointed images and odd, fragmentary sensory phrases into something that feels like a story or a coherent emotional statement. Thankfully, the album mostly lives, and it's a small testament to the seemingly paradoxical ability of ethereal, bodyless music to affect us viscerally. To back up a bit, OK Bear is a confident modern-rock album, and Enigk spends considerably less time fussing with big arrangements and sweeping gestures than he did on 2006's World Waits. These songs are among his most direct, mature compositions yet in spite of their often oblique lyrics, and his delicately ragged voice is in fine form as he works to sell them. He controls the intensity of each song quite well--""April Storm"" in particular benefits from a great deal of restrain in the early verses, and you really feel it when he opens up in the last verse and the guitars start to grind a little. The album's most dramatic moment is also one of its weirdest, from a songwriting perspective. ""Just a State of Mind"" begins softly, with acoustic guitars and harmony vocals, and picks up with each verse, and then, at literally the last moment, he introduces a brand new, dramatic melody on the last two lines. It feels like the song is about to take off into some sweeping new section, but instead it just ends, leaving the listener hanging. ""Sandwich Time"" is more conventional, and probably the catchiest rock song on the album, with Enigk running his backing vocals through a Leslie cabinet (or a convincing approximation of one). In an unusual error, ""Sandwich Time"" and ""In a Look"" are flipped on the tracklist, both on the rear cover art and in the printed lyrics (""Sandwich Time"" is actually track seven, while ""In a Look"" is actually track six). ""In a Look"" is a piano-driven song with a good 6/8 beat and some Eric Matthews-ish horns on the bridge. The album's production aids Enigk's careful drama management, keeping every acoustic and electric guitar, Rhodes piano, bassline, and synth separate and strong-- all that space gives the dynamic shifts more power. OK Bear is a good album-- it won't blow you away, but I get the sense from listening that Enigk is confident enough in his music not to need to blow you away. Simply moving you a little is enough now, and sometimes it's nice to have an album that does that so ably and unpretentiously.","Ex-Sunny Day Real Estate leader's third solo album locates emotional coherence in disjointed images and fragmentary phrases.

Manners,Passion Pit,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c5b1335d7bf1698a3c/1:1/w_160/775d9e10.jpg,2009-05-22 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13169-manners/,ColumbiaFrenchkiss,"Even if the rock kids aren't doing the standing still as much these days, indie-friendly electro-pop bands are still liable to have their own backs against the wall-- Hot Chip with their Urkel affectations, Junior Boys' overriding permafrost, Cut Copy and their unflappable cool. Despite residing on the always trustworthy Frenchkiss, Passion Pit aren't cool. Their approach to danceable rock music is more Friday night than year-end-list. It's also distinctly, for a lack of a better term, American. It's extroverted, brash, and unconcerned with nuance, each synthesizer used for maximum melodic impact instead of texture. Most of the time, singer Michael Angelakos' half-eunuch/half-Jeremy Enigk voice is likely voicing some sort of commentary on his feelings. There's an almost archaic belief that a record should have at least four singles and the nagging feeling that Passion Pit could just be another garage/emo band that traded in their guitars for samplers. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, just about all of this works in Manners' favor, as it's the sort of heart-to-heart populist record that's every bit as sincere as it is infectious-- though Angelakos sings in a manner rarely heard outside of a shower with unpredictable temperature control, it feels symbolic of a band that's completely unashamed, not shameless, in its pursuit of a human connection. It's easy to be skeptical. I understand. Passion Pit are, after all, following a buzzed-about EP, Chunk of Change, that attracted detractors and admirers in equal measure. The story of Manners, however, is how Passion Pit evolve from a one-man pet project to a fully fleshed concern that gives substance to Angelakos' melodic sensibilities over the course of more focused song lengths, more dynamic arrangements, and 40 minutes of joy-buzzer pushing. Chunk of Change certainly had its rickety charms, but while ""Make Light"", ""Moth's Wings"", and ""Eyes as Candles"" retain the EP's building blocks-- glycemic keyboards, insistent major keys, and falsetto-- their compositional aspects go beyond what Passion Pit were capable of as a solo affair. ""Make Light"", despite working patiently towards a satisfying hook, would've likely plateaued during its midsection, but Nate Donmoyer's live drums keep it skidding perilously towards an organic collapse Chunk of Change never allowed. The elegiac tempos of ""Moth's Wings"" and ""Eyes as Candles"" veer closer to first-kiss soundtracking than even Chunk's mushier moments, but they're rendered fleshy with slowly blossoming arrangements of church choirs, saxophones, and a winding synth lead on the latter that catches you off-guard with its similarity to ""Walk of Life"". Barely past drinking age, Passion Pit are obviously overjoyed with the studio as romper room, but the toy that has gotten the most attention is the kiddie choir that pops up on two of the first four songs. Call them behind-the-curve as they double up the ""higher and higher"" part of the chorus from ""Little Secrets"" (that's the one that sounds like ""D.A.N.C.E."", Jarvis), but it's more over-the-top, and that's kind of the point-- in a weird way, it's heartening how little Passion Pit concerns themselves with decorum or trend-watching in the search of an irresistible hook. Manners does go for the quick knockout, pulling a similar trick five minutes later on the Hissing Fauna branch-off ""The Reeling"", and while Side B tends to delay gratification, Manners is deceptively consistent even beyond its singles-- if you like one Passion Pit song, you'll probably like them all. Or you might not like any at all-- though ""Sleepyhead"" has proven to be something of the consensus, its real-time chipmunk soul ambitions fitting in better on Manners than it did tacked as a transitional track at the end of Chunk of Change. But as ""Let Your Love Grow Tall"" ushers in last call with a big ol' group hug, I realize how it puts me in a difficult position as a music critic: what happens when you're scrambling to think of why a record is worth hearing and you keep coming back to ""it makes me happy""? Too often, we use a band's debut simply to conjure comparisons to other bands, but Manners is every bit as likely to bring to mind a successful night out with friends, or the party where you finally got to talk to that person you've been eying all semester. The video for ""The Reeling"" certainly helps with that visualization, but in a manner similar to layers of faux-flesh being peeled off Angelakos' face, the cracked-up lyrics themselves ache for some sort of connection after realizing the futility of physical and emotional bunkers*.* It's a fitting contrast for a record that's certainly not the most innovative or cred-boosting you'll hear this year, but quite possibly the one that most demands to be socialized with and is just so easy to love back.","Destined to be loved or hated,Â it's heartening how little Passion Pit concern themselves with decorum or trend-watching in search of an irresistible hook.

Two listens in, though, and it was clear: American Idiot was musically dodgy and politically empty. Political pop has its place, at least when didacticism doesn't drain the wit and life from a band's songwriting. But American Idiot failed utterly as coherent propaganda and as rock invigorating enough to agitate the pleasure centers. Have you tried to parse the lyrics to ""Holiday"" or ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" lately? This wasn't anti-imperialist dissent set to kick-ass. It was gaudy, way-too-impressionistic, self-congratulatory garbage warbled over lumbering AOR dressed in strings and conceptual malarkey. The fact that American Idiot had an undercurrent of lukewarm liberal backslapping, and was released during the blackest days of the W. era, certainly gave it a big contextual profile boost at the time. But what really assured its success was the fact that the band had smartly made a grab-bag of proven gestures swiped from the ignoble history of Big Rock, along with some earnest, commercially canny self-cannibalization. And then there was the icky transparency of the band's attempt to shuck their lingering entry-level pop-punk rep, the last of the slack-and-proud generation to reveal their sad, predictable need for ""boomer respect."" When a record like that sells a bazillion copies, you can be assured that the band won't be scaling back its ambitions on the follow-up. And 21st Century Breakdown is indeed another hour-plus slab of jumped-up alt-rock as political/musical theater-- overlong, exhausting, and corny as hell. If American Idiot was an aesthetic failure, you certainly never doubted the band's conviction. Sure, you might cringe when you realized all that effort was in service of fulfilling Billie Joe Armstrong's dreams of merging boneheaded pogo-pop with Broadway shlock. You might have lamented that no one pointed out the inanity of many of the album's creative choices, like naming a protagonist ""Jesus of Suburbia"", perhaps because Armstrong was a grown-ass millionaire with carte blanche from his corporate masters. Nonetheless, the band really put its backs into that vapid, humorless trash. 21st Century Breakdown is just as pompous and dumb, but it lacks even that old misguided passion. It's a slog, but not the kind that results when a band forgets the importance of editing when in the throes of ""trying to say something."" Its sprawl feels entirely unearned, three men worried about meeting expectations rather than driven by urgency. The performances are blandly professional, because any major-label rock band of Green Day's abilities could shit this stuff out in their sleep, and emotionally inert. This is the crafting of a modern epic as a dreary day-job routine. TrÃ© Cool-- a drummer who's never really progressed beyond ""fast with a lot of rolls"" and ""mid-tempo militaristic oompah""-- flaunts his competence level with a metronomic anti-creativity. Mike Dirnt's bass playing, once reliably adding needed punch to band's flimsier tunes, is often buried under Armstrong's claustrophobic, monochromatic guitar. As a songwriter, Armstrong was always juicing the platonic pop-punk tune at best. Listening to him try classic rock moves is cringe-y in the way you'd expect when a guy with a limited skill set pines for stadium godhood. Having exhausted his new tricks on American Idiot, he's descended into repetition, almost self-parody. And what he's recycling wasn't much worth hearing in the first place. Just count the number of times he falls back on the lame bait-and-switch of the pretty acoustic intro, setting the listener up to expect one of Green Day's oft-regrettable ballads, only to kick in with a faceless blast of ur-mall-punk. Or the lifeless Frankensteins of songs from International Superhits, the sound of man stitching his past hits together out of desperation or callowness or both. It's kind of amazing an album with so many multi-genre suites and deliberate mid-song shifts in mood can also feel so maddeningly static for long stretches. You start to cling to the novelties and experiments, however bad: the way ""Peacemaker"" sounds like a cutting-room leftover from some ersatz American International Pictures surf/spy movie, or the more-Wings-than-Fabs McCartney bite of ""Last Night on Earth"". As for the album's storyline, I plead the most willful kind of ignorance. It seems to be another loosely sketched state-of-the-union about how far up shit creek we are as a nation/planet, with a slight positivist tinge given this weird pause we seem to be in between reconstruction and total collapse. So ""desperate, but not hopeless"" is about as close as Armstrong gets to a memorably bite-sized universalist sentiment. The lyrics are otherwise another do-you-really-have-the-time-to-unpack-this jumble of inscrutable storytelling, pseudo-profundities, and just-add-bile anti-authoritarianism. Which means I could be mistaking plain ol' love songs for Major Statements. Or it could be that Armstrong's pretensions now completely obscure any remaining bubblegum charmers. You can listen only so long for something catchy and human-scaled while being consistently rewarded with lines like, ""When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul, your faith walks on broken glass."" Green Day had been augmenting the three-chords-or-less thrashing since the trad power-pop touches of Nimrod, taking it further with the Brit Invasion homages that peppered Warning. Musically, a self-consciously eclectic and ambitious Green Day had been a reality long before Armstrong began gorging on Headline News and the Springsteenian mythos. But Green Day's late-decade addiction to scale, and reinforcing their own stature, has drained all the immediacy and pleasure from their music. Without some sort of attitude-correcting flop, the band will probably continue to abuse your tolerance for ego-driven padding. And if the CD format finally expires between now and the next one, watch out when Billie Joe convinces Reprise to disseminate his next Economist-meets-Vegas horrorshow on snappily branded external hard drives.","Like predecessor American Idiot,Â 21st Century Breakdown is another hour-plus slab of jumped-up alt-rock as political/musical theater.

Black Cascade / Malevolent Grain EP,Wolves in the Throne Room,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41db1335d7bf16988a5/1:1/w_160/fb27263e.jpg,2009-05-21 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13030-black-cascade-malevolent-grain-ep/,Southern Lord,"As much as one can call anything associated with black metal a crossover record, Two Hunters-- the sprawling second album from Wolves in the Throne Room-- was just that. Extolled by critics, embraced by indie rock kids, appreciated by metal legions, Wolves' overwhelming crescendos and glowing decrescendos, beautiful and brutal, spoke as much to worshippers of Emperor's Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk as acolytes of Radiohead's Kid A. The band offered an enigmatic allure, too, speaking of its communal farm outside of Olympia, Wash. And Wolves' espousal of a pagan approach to black metal-- a genre long bound to an upside-down cross-- was refreshing. So purists be damned: Two years ago, Wolves in the Throne Room offered a rendezvous for two very unlikely demographics by aiming extreme in several directions. Whatever bridges Wolves might have built in 2007 are mostly a memory this year, though: The EP Malevolent Grain and the LP Black Cascade disassemble the integrated power of Two Hunters and its predecessor, Diadem of 12 Stars, by plucking the black-metal sections from their former surrounding swells and stretching their ends until what's left feels mostly like a flatline. Imagine cutting cheap wine with water and trying to get drunk: It's unnecessary work for little payoff. Excepting the first side of Malevolent Grain, each of the six Wolves cuts is a smear, smoothing black metal's disruptive bursts into 10-14 minute trances that slowly, sparingly shift in meter and volume. The idea-- to create a stable atmosphere from music that traditionally gnashes any space it fills-- is more interesting than its execution. For instance, ""Hate Crystal"", Malevolent Grain's B-side, is an 11-minute march that opens at full blast and ends mostly at the same clip. The guitars move in orthodox progressions, and the drums steadily chew from beneath, adding variety with the occasional extra cymbal splash or snare drop. Only the song's understated coda-- where the parts fall out of lockstep and apart from one another without fading out-- offers intrigue. Like William Basinski's The Disintegration Loop I-IV, the object's corrosion is more interesting than the object itself. Also, that's not a compliment. All of Black Cascade pounds away with a similar notion for four tracks and 50 minutes, offering four black metal tides that occasionally shift into some texturally bankrupt, wintry drone. Separated from its once-intriguing surroundings, Wolves' music feels listless and dull-- music doing its best to get by on size, not strength or sound. It's not compelling. At least it's listenable. Side A of Malevolent Grain isn't: Released in America as a limited run of black vinyl and in Europe as a set of 700 12"" picture discs that sold out almost immediately, Malevolent Grain is barely worth the Google search it takes to find free, high-quality rips. The EP splits the band's powers between the record's halves, so that the heavy stuff comes on the B-side. The A-side, then, is a workshop for Jamie Meyers, this effort's token female. She possesses less nuance than Jessica Kinney, the Two Hunters vocalist who seemed so well suited for those tunes. The three-piece rock rumble suggests an eventual eruption, but the band simply varies its speed, volume, and density, lashing repeatedly against a few notes and themes. Maybe that sounds nice, but-- left alone above it all, minus a structural or sonic foil-- Meyers sounds like Evanescence leading a tribute to Enya. It's a 13-minute cringefest. Perhaps these releases are concessions to the difficulty of climbing from a tour van nightly and recreating such complex music onstage. Then, of course, there's the frustration of disappointed fans who expect it all and get only the band's heavier tendencies with the price of admission. That's fair enough, I suppose. But must a live show meet a record's standards? And should a performance dictate a record by a band that once took such risks? Indeed, the live experience is an extemporaneous one-- here tonight, restarted tomorrow. But a great record, one hopes, can be its own statement, something that lives forever in a world of its own design. With its deity talk and complete grandeur, Two Hunters worked like that. It was adventurous, engaged, imaginative. At their best, though, Malevolent Grain and Black Cascade, are just sort of there, kicking up a thin cloud of dust they're hoping you'll perceive as pitch black.","After two exceptional black metal records, Wolves in the Throne Room return this year with a new EP and LP.

Magnolia,The Wooden Birds,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a450b1335d7bf1698916/1:1/w_160/48723ae1.jpg,2009-05-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13070-magnolia/,Barsuk,"The American Analog Set toed the line between sleepy and dreamy so closely that it was easy to take the group for granted. When the band worked at its peak, it operated in a sort of twilight haze, and the ease with which one got lost in its beauty played a large part in determining what one got out of it. Factor in their more or less lasting hiatus (recent SXSW reunion aside), and the American Analog Set legacy hangs in a sort of hazy purgatory. Did the band exist, or did we merely imagine it? The ghostly memory of the AmAnSet lingers near leader Andrew Kenny's new project the Wooden Birds as well,Â but it hardly hovers over it. If anything, Kenny, never a howler, is even more hushed here, with the Wooden Birds' debut Magnolia sounding as if it were recorded under extenuating circumstances-- a sleeping baby upstairs, say, or a sensitive neighbor-- only for Kenny to discover he liked how those muffled results turned out.Â Kenny and his new cohorts David Wingo, Lymbyc System drummer Michael Bell, and American Analog-vet Leslie Sisson seem to relish working within these spare constraints, where every note counts and nothing slips in to clutter to the songs. That precision and the process seem to have pushed Kenny in an interesting musical direction, too, seeing as so much of Magnolia recalls Lindsey Buckingham at his least manic, specifically the strange little ditties that fill Fleetwood Mac's Tusk and Mirage, nestled between the bigger hits. The resemblance is almost uncanny on songs such as ""False Alarm"", ""Hailey"", and the brief ""Hometown Fantasy"", which contains a heart-grabbing minor turn that's a perfect counter to its initial country feel. That loose country vibe pervades tracks like ""The Other One"", ""Quit You Once"", and ""Never Know"" as well, each relatively interchangeable but so tasteful and uncomplicated their redundancy doesn't hurt, especially when Sisson starts chiming in with some breathy harmonies that fit the limited musical field like the last piece of a (simple) puzzle. After that it's back to songs like ""Anna Paula"" and ""Seven Seventeen"", the latter a deceptively sweet meet-cute number, and each with Sisson again playing a subdued Stevie Nicks to Kenny's mellow-mode Buckingham.Â Like much of Magnolia before it, the songs lope along quiet, lazy rhythms in no particular hurry to get where they're going. But while the Wooden Birds never quite arrive anywhere special, that's not to say Kenny isn't pointed that general direction. If Magnolia is a disc tinged with innocence and nostalgia, it's tinted by a hint of shadowy dread drawn from someplace more mysterious than Kenny is willing to reveal just yet.","The American Analog Set's Andrew Kenny returns with a muffled, precise set that recalls a slightly countrified Lindsey Buckingham.

Fantasy Ride,Ciara,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4699d034d5c69bf306d/1:1/w_160/f65a6d52.jpg,2009-05-21 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13092-fantasy-ride/,LaFace,"Such a weird album. Ciara's never exactly been an album artist, but her last two records had album tracks that were good for at least a few moments of dizzy slow-burn pop ecstasy, her languid robotic coo curling itself around expertly futuristic tracks from whatever producer was on fire that year. Ciara's main gift was the way her soft, tiny voice would disappear into the track, turning itself into just one working part in a beautiful, gleaming machine. It's not that she didn't have personality; there's a certain sweet-hearted down-home snap to singles like ""Goodies"" and ""Oh"", and the take-no-shit force of those songs made the heart-stopping ballad ""Promise"" sound that much more sweet and tender. But her brilliance has always been in interpretation, in selling a pop producer's furthest-out future-pop ideas and turning them into expert summertime pop. And it's that malleability that made her seem something like a new Janet Jackson, complete with headset mic. Except in the lead-up to Fantasy Ride, she's come off more like circa-'09 Janet, thrashing around desperately for a hit single and facing interminable album-release pushbacks. Fantasy Ride went through two failed singles (the first of which, the T-Pain collab ""Go Girl"", doesn't even appear on the album) before the unimaginative but okay ""Love Sex Magic"" finally got her the radio foothold that had been hers to lose a couple of years ago. ""Love Sex Magic"" is really just a bargain-basement Justin Timberlake track, the sort of thing he could've had lying around in a closet somewhere nearly three years after FutureSex/LoveSounds. It's not bad, exactly; I like the elastic disco bounce. But it's lazy, and Timberlake's nerdy swagger really highlights Ciara's total lack of presence. That's a problem that comes up over and over on the album. The big issue here is one of desperation. Every song clearly longs to be a hit. She's enlisted an absolute murderers' row of producers: Polow, Danja, The-Dream/Tricky Stewart. All of these people seem like they should be able to work magic with Ciara, but somehow, the songs just aren't there. The-Dream and Tricky Stewart tend to fill their tracks with empty spaces, and Ciara's voice needs hall-of-mirrors production to really register, so slight, minimal tracks like ""Ciara to the Stage"" and ""Like a Surgeon"" leave her sounding stranded. ""Pucker Up"" has a flat, tinny club-pop beat from Rodney Jerkins (still alive!) and lots of talk about Ciara's swag, a concept that even she does not seem to quite get. The Timberlake co-written ""G is for Girl (A-Z)"" has an unbelievably goofy alphabetical-slaughter lyrical conceit. ""Turntables"" has a really good moment where it switches abruptly from crispy electro to EQed-out bloghouse, but the impact is sort of blunted by the presence of Chris Brown. And it's not like Brown does anything particularly egregious on the song, but, I mean, this guy just famously (OK, allegedly) mashed out his pop-star girlfriend on Grammy night. Why would you invite him onto your album for his first post-abuse appearance? Do you need a hit that badly? ""1, 2 Step"", Ciara's second hit, was breezy little roller-rink electro jam, and one of the best things about it was how effortless it sounded. And now Ciara's thrashing around looking for a single, and somehow, it shows. And yet that almost manic obsession with crossover love leads Fantasy Ride to some great, fascinating places. ""High Price"", in a lot of ways, is a straight-up ""Oh"" retool (right down to the great, stuttery Ludacris guest-verse), except Ciara, for no apparent reason, sings it in this histrionic opera voice, which lends her shit-talk lyrics a hallucinatory power: ""See me in the drop, head fresh up out the hair salon/ Booty look softer than a McDonald's hamburger bun."" (Those aren't even soft!) ""Never Ever"" takes a big chunk of its chorus from a song I never could stand, the Philly soul staple ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"", and surrounds it with dizzily great Polow da Don production flourishes and a typically superb Young Jeezy guest-verse, somehow rendering its source material tolerable in the process. ""I Don't Remember"" is a sweaty, uncomfortable heartbroken hangover song, with whooshing Euro-trance keyboards that feel so totally wrong that they sort of work. So that's what you get with Fantasy Ride: A few brilliant left turns that feel almost accidental mixed in with a sort of end-times hunger for a top-40 audience that doesn't seem to exist anymore. As a vivid little snapshot of what's happened to the pop music business, it's fascinating. But it's not much of an album.","After a stretch of wonderful, diverse singles, Ciara hunts high and low for a new hit and loses her already slippery identity in the process.

"Yours Truly, The Commuter",Jason Lytle,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a428ea9e61561daa4e38/1:1/w_160/878406a0.jpg,2009-05-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13037-yours-truly-the-commuter/,Anti-,"It bears repeating: What a strange world Jason Lytle inhabits. As the frontman for Modesto, California-based Grandaddy, he sang about homemade pets, homesick space miners, and carpool jockeys struck dumb by the natural world. Three years after that band's final breaths, his world has grown no less odd. On his first solo album, he sets songs about dead dogs and birds on suicide watch to technorganic arrangements featuring ELO guitars, from-the-heart-of-space synths, and steady, stoic drums-- if drums can be said to sound stoic, which in Lytle's world, why the hell not? With Grandaddy, Lytle sung his mock epics with such earnestness that many took them as ironic, which itself is a little ironic. But then as now, his songs work because they are deeply sincere, and that sincerity makes them sound all the more awestruck and imaginative. So Yours Truly, The Commuter sounds an awful lot like a Grandaddy album-- not just another Grandaddy album, though, but a really good one, the best since Sumday. Relocated from Modesto to Bozeman, Mont., he recorded these dozen songs over three years, sequestering himself in his home studio to indulge the perfectionism he says he couldn't entertain with the band. It's a return, of sorts, to his roots: Grandaddy was born as a solo bedroom project for Lytle in the mid-90s and mutated into a full band. Such care and attention show through in these songs, which generally sound a little spacier and synthier than the band's records. On the other hand, in three years you'd think he could have come up with a better album cover. Yours Truly opens with what sounds like a thumb piano playing a quiet overture, which is interrupted first by a foundational bass rhythm and then by Lytle's warmly familiar voice: Lytle: ""Last thing I heard I was left for dead.""
Comically high-pitched chorus: ""Yeah?""
Lytle: ""I could give two shits about what they said. I may be limping, but I'm coming home."" Is this a rebuke to critics who greeted Grandaddy's final breaths with enthused ambivalence, to no-longer-amicable bandmates, or to some made-up tormentors too quick to turn their backs on him? Whatever the target, the song strikes a defiant early note, and because it's not only a solo album but a solo debut, it's tempting and perhaps way too easy to read way too much into such moments. But Yours Truly is strong enough to absorb whatever interpretation you throw at it and still retain some of its mystery. Besides, defiance fits Lytle like s a sleek spacesuit. The title track immediately restores some of the old grandeur to his signature sound, and songs like the defensive ""Ghost of My Old Dog"" and the piano lament ""This Song Is the Mute Button"" have unexpected bite. ""I see the pretty in things,"" he sings on the latter, ""but you disappeared like a dream."" Lytle offsets the somewhat caustic tone that creeps into some of these songs with tender ruminations on absence, which fills the album. ""Rollin' Home Alone"", possibly a sequel to the title track, grafts a distorted synth line to sugary canned strings to evoke a great American expanse, as if to soundtrack some long, lonely road trip. ""Flying Thru Canyons"" creates a churchly ambience perfectly summed up by that title. On the other hand, ""It's the Weekend"" is Lytle's Loverboy moment, a churning power-pop anthem that sounds like a Friday-afternoon staple on classic rock stations of the future. As with previous albums, Yours Truly benefits from creative sequencing that winks at expectations. There are two obvious closers here, and neither of them come at the album's end. The first is the opening title track, whose chorus-- ""I may be limping, but I'm coming home""-- makes Lytle sound like a true survivor, and the second is the soft lament ""You're Too Gone"", which ends with him singing ""So long, so long"" like he's floating away in a space pod. Instead, everything closes with ""Here for Good"", a tender, almost entropic ballad that sounds less like mission accomplished than a mission never undertaken. Again, it's tempting to read real-life connections in a song like ""Here for Good"". It's not that they're not there, but they don't matter. Such autobiographical trappings aren't necessary to make Yours Truly sound strangely affecting or Lytle newly reinvigorated.","Recorded over three years, the former Grandaddy leader's debut LP sounds like... a Grandaddy album. Thankfully, a good one.

Rainwater Cassette Exchange,Deerhunter,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f29d034d5c69bf2f4a/1:1/w_160/eb96ef45.jpg,2009-05-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12991-rainwater-cassette-exchange/,Kranky4AD,"Everybody's dying just to get the disease. Confidential to the celebs in surgical masks: If there's a real pandemic, we're all already born with it. No, not swine flu, bird flu, monkey pox, SARS, or West Nile virus. Not even anthrax, that post-9/11, pre-Iraq War worry most people appeared to forget overnight. The names of the diseases may change, but the panics they generate all represent the same thing: We're gonna die. And we couldn't be more terrified. It isn't clear whether My Bloody Valentine will get their long-delayed reissues out before the CD dies; if current patterns hold though,Â Loveless lovers Deerhunter will have released more than enough spaced-out dominance. Many of their songs change drastically from online demo to final incarnation, but Atlanta's noise-pop lightning rods put it all out there. As with Lil Wayne and his workload, it's as if they sense their time here is limited. Please god, nobody mention Ryan Adams. Although the total output by Deerhunter and various side projects can be uneven, the full band's official Kranky releases have rarely been less than face-melting.Â Rainwater Cassette Exchange is the fourth Deerhunter-related release on the label since October-- including last year'sÂ Microcastle/Weird Era Cont. album pairing plus guitarist Lockett Pundt's recent debut as Lotus Plaza,Â The Floodlight Collective-- and it's also maybe the slightest to bear the Deerhunter name. Now you hear it, now you don't. What was I just listening to again? Except, justifiably, Deerhunter have a pretty big name to live up to at this point. And the more you listen to their latest release, the more it rewards you.Â Rainwater Cassette Exchange is nothing more-- and nothing less-- than five songs, lasting a total of just more than 15 minutes. Ranging from translucent psych-pop to pummeling garage-rock, they're alternately assured and vulnerable, direct and subtle, light and dark. Their repetitions toe the band's usual thin line between hooks and hypnotism. Through it all, we're haunted by disease and, ultimately, our own inevitable death. So many useless bodies. As theÂ Fluorescent Grey EP was toÂ Cryptograms, soÂ Rainwater Cassette Exchange is toÂ Microcastle. Most of these songs would make sense packaged as a third piece of vinyl alongsideÂ Microcastle/Weird Era Cont., though they have less in common withÂ Weird Era's vast sprawl. LikeÂ Microcastle, the new EP-- available digitally now, on CD and vinyl June 22-- was recorded with producer Nicolas Vernhes at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room. Also likeÂ Microcastle,Â Rainwater Cassette Exchange shifts between delicate 1960s-pop tunefulness and fist-pumping dopamine surges. ""I wantedÂ Microcastle andÂ Weird Era to be a Fall/Winter record,"" Bradford Cox once wrote in a blog post that has since been deleted. Among the last sounds you'll hear on the current EP is a child's cry of ""trick or treat."" Whether it's lilting melodies, some new-and-improved vocal harmonies, or Strokes-cum-Magazine stately clangor,Â Rainwater Cassette Exchange makes with the treats first. Then, as much as Cox likes to downplay the band's lyrics, you notice the ghostly stuff, the warnings of impending mortality. Autumnal material, yeah, but its bleak truths resonate all the more against the budding spring weather outside. First, the treats. The title track opens the EP with girl-group sugar that helps the reverb-heavy overdrive go down. ""Do-oooh-oooh you believe in love at first sight?"" Cox sings, his voice beatific, his lyric Beatles-y (""With a Little Help From My Friends"", last verse, first line). Three songs-- ""Disappearing Ink"", ""Famous Last Words"", and ""Circulation""-- are propulsive garage-rock anthems in the style ofÂ Microcastle marquee moment ""Nothing Ever Happened"". The only other track, the lonesome ""Game of Diamonds"", started life on Deerhunter's blog, where it was drenched in shoegaze distortion. Here it gets a softer arrangement featuring piano and acoustic guitar-- all the better to hear Cox's uniquely engaging vocals, clear and frail and fricative. It all sounds so harmless, it's a treat to find out we're actually getting tricked. ""Rainwater Cassette Exchange"" is sort of likeÂ Microcastle's ""Agoraphobia"", had that song's erotically asphyxiated protagonist already been dead, or its arrangement paradoxically sprightlier. ""Famous Last Words"" opens with a lyric about ""your brother bleeding"" on the sidewalk, while a wobbly Theremin adds to the eerie October mood. Despite putting an Everly Brothers-esque vocal duet over distorted guitar lines, ""Circulation"" is about ""bad"" circulation, and Cox has a heart condition. ""Hands reach for my light when it gets dark,"" it sounds like he's saying, right before the song veers off into two minutes of bittersweet sound collage around where the live version becomes draped with ethereal vocal loops. IfÂ Rainwater Cassette Exchange sounded evanescent to me on first listens, well, so are we. ""Time never meant that much to me,"" Cox sings on ""Game of Diamonds"", but that's belied not only by Deerhunter's work ethic, but also by words that Cox's emotionally isolated narrator-- Jens Lekman's ""It Was a Strange Time in My Life"" comes to mind-- repeats elsewhere in the song: ""I've counted every grain of sand."" Like, our endless numbered days. When Cox sings about lying drunk on the Bowery, it's hard for me not to think of that night he rambled endlessly and flouted New York's smoking laws at the Bowery Ballroom. That stuff'll kill ya, you know. So what do you think is gonna happen to us now? Are we gonna get younger, happier, prettier? ""Nothing can be changed,"" goes ""Famous Last Words"", but that isn't exactly true. Consider ""Disappearing Ink"" a metaphor for the temporariness of it all, and for what's permanent: ""Disappearing ink, but the words still sting."" After you play a good song, it's gone in the air, but you can still feel it. After you type something stupid on the internet, you can try to delete it, but you can't take it back. That means you and I are gonna live forever. Now those would be famous last words.","The fourth Deerhunter-related release on Kranky since October, this five-song EP ranges fromÂ translucent psych-pop to pummeling garage-rock.

Kappe,Svarte Greiner,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34dea9e61561daa4c45/1:1/w_160/615bff84.jpg,2009-05-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12862-kappe/,Type,"To paraphrase online reports: Svarte Greiner's Erik Skodvin comes riding from the dark, epic wastes of Scandinavialand, quaffing wyrmblood out of a hellmug and pronouncing mad soliloquies of doom. This kind of marketing creates strange dissonances with the music on Kappe. Sure, it's gloomy and foreboding. But it's also strident and glacially paced; it sounds more like a depressed La Monte Young than an heir of metal ancestry. At the same time, it strongly evokes the modulating bass oceans of Sunn O))). Ultimately, Kappe emphasizes how close this modern strand of abstract doom-metal is to postwar minimal aesthetics. Kappe's atmosphere is familiar from Skodvin's last album, Knive. Ghosts rattle doorknobs in mansions of brooding tone; moaning saxophone and browned-out guitar harrow each other through claustrophobic effects rings. But the execution is different in almost every way. Knive deployed a broader variety of sounds across tighter fields, with deeper weavings of texture that verged on beats. There was a haltingness to it, as if the sounds were being painfully ejected, like kidney stones. Kappe trades Knive's ear-catching shiftiness for gradual, hard-won fruition, a slow marathon of drifting gray sheens. It's commanding and stodgy where Knive was striving, convulsed. It seems at once more accomplished and less interesting. This is mainly because Knive's unruly approach didn't call for climaxes; sounds appearing or mutating at jagged intervals were hooks enough. But Kappe's measured long-tone variations prime us for moments of clarity, which appear tortuously, if at all. After seven minutes of disembodied wails and creaking gears, we never see the light at the end of ""Tunnel of Love"", just vanish into darkness. ""Where Am I"" (always an appropriate question to ask of a Svarte Greiner song) begins with a singing bowl-like dirge; snatches of melody flit through the 16 grueling minutes of ""Candle Light Dinner Actress"", as Skodvin bathes a single, sullen note in corrosive harmonies until it dissolves, leaving the track to gnaw on itself like an empty stomach. I wouldn't deign to penalize Skodvin for asking listeners for sometimes-immense feats of patience, but Kappe is so reserved and sternly formal that it can seem impersonal. There are caverns of detail and development buried in the opiated atmosphere, but I had to focus my full attention on the music for protracted spans to perceive them. Anything less discloses what sounds like an inordinately spooky traffic jam: a just-there wash of overpass rumbles, bicycle clatters, air-brake shrieks, and windy moon-roof ambiance.","Latest from this Scandinavian doom artist sounds more like a depressed La Monte Young than an heir of metal ancestry.

Clues,Clues,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42713d1975652138c4f/1:1/w_160/b1d5abc9.jpg,2009-05-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13036-clues/,Constellation,"Back in 2003, Alden Penner was a member of the Unicorns, one of the first bands to draw serious attention to Montreal's thriving indie rock scene. At the same time, Brendan Reed was the drummer of Arcade Fire, and performed on that band's debut EP. Just a year later, Arcade Fire exploded in popularity just after Reed's departure, and the Unicorns imploded and disbanded before ever recording a second album. Though Penner and Reed have been active in the time since, Clues' self-titled debut marks both artists' return to the spotlight since their crucial early efforts in building Montreal's well-deserved reputation as one of the best arts scenes in North America. Given that Penner is the primary songwriter in Clues, it should come as no surprise that the band's music bears a stronger resemblance to the skewed art pop of the Unicorns than the heart-pounding stadium anthems of Arcade Fire. Penner's guitar style remains hyperactive and colorful, but his songwriting has become more ambitious, adapting his former band's sense of faux-mystical whimsy to arrangements implying danger and adventure, resulting in music that often sounds as if it were intended to be the soundtrack of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. The songs that most closely match this description are easily the most rewarding. The riffs in ""Cave Mouth"" swing and slash like an enormous battle ax; ""Remember Severed Head"" and ""Approach the Throne"" marry grandiose melodic themes and urgent, adrenaline-pumping rhythms. In these tracks, Clues hit upon a magical combination of Chavez's razor sharp chord progressions, the quasi-Medieval melodic sensibility of late-period Helium, and the oddball drama of the Danielson Famile. The band is less successful in its quieter moments. Though about half of the album rocks outs with a twitchy, childlike enthusiasm, the remainder is deliberately static and lethargic. They are particularly fond of sequencing lulls before their most aggressive moments, as with the long, repetitive quasi-folk number that gradually builds to the manic burst of energy at the start of ""Cave Mouth"", or the tense ambience that carries through the opener ""Haarp"" until it erupts into a punk-rock payoff in its final minute. On a conceptual level, this is fine, and they are more than capable of evoking a spooky atmosphere, but these slower passages are simply not as pleasurable and well-realized as their frenetic rockers. These cuts also highlight the band's flaws. Just as Clues exaggerate dynamic shifts in their more rocking compositions, they also push their stillness to unfortunate extremes, resulting in seemingly interminable tracks that overwork threadbare melodic themes. Penner's thin voice is not flattered by the slowness either, as it nudges him to sing in an often-annoying nasal whine that sounds a bit like someone doing a mean-spirited impression of Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue. Aside from these problems, Clues is a very assured debut with a fully formed aesthetic that exploits the strengths of its players while pushing them beyond their established comfort zones. With any luck, Penner will be able to stick with this project for a second album-- there may be some excellent tracks on this record, but it mostly hints at better things to come down the line.","Ex-members of Arcade Fire and the Unicorns team for a record that's closer to the latter'sÂ skewed art pop than the former's stadium anthems.

Lost Channels,Great Lake Swimmers,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42eb1335d7bf16988ca/1:1/w_160/75debae6.jpg,2009-05-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13042-lost-channels/,Nettwerk,"Many a moment at rock club, record store, dive bar, and web forum has been wasted arguing over what the word ""indie"" means any more, or ever meant-- whether it refers to a style, an ethic, a condition of artistic and financial freedom, or some combination of these factors (and others). Be that as it may, it seems fair to suggest that Lost Channels, the fourth full-length from Toronto-based Tony Dekker's Great Lake Swimmers project, sounds less ""indie"" than any previous Swimmers record. There's a degree of polish to the 12 tracks here that we haven't heard before from Dekker, though this feels less like the product of any meddling on the part of label Nettwerk-- a company that has worked with Canadian megastars Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan, not to mention Coldplay-- than a natural progression for a one-time solo endeavor that has attracted an orbit of like-minded co-conspirators over the years. Along with the polish, it's the efforts of these co-conspirators that help make Channels feel like something ""more"" than an indie record. Some fuss has been made over the exotic locales where the album was put to tape-- abandoned grain silos, churches, historic sites, even an old castle situated on the St. Lawrence Seaway-- but the real story here is what was recorded and how well it all comes together. Chiming guitars dosado with warm flecks of banjo and light washes of electric organ in a series of dances that are dense in their construction but still deft in their execution. Electric and acoustic instruments mingle so effectively that it seems moot to make that distinction between them. Indeed, tracks such as the winning opener ""Palmistry"", ""Pulling on a Line"", and ""She Comes to Me in Dreams"" call to mind the more baroque moments from another act that did a pretty darn good job honing itself into something radio-friendly: R.E.M. (think Out of Time standouts ""Half a World Away"" and ""Losing My Religion""). However the Swimmers have a ways to go if they're ever to scale the heights of Michael Stipe & Co. (and one doubts that's really what they're aspiring to at this point, anyway). Plainly put, the songwriting here just isn't all big-league yet. Quieter tracks like ""Everything Is Moving So Fast"", ""Stealing Tomorrow"", and ""Concrete Heart"" reveal that Dekker still has some room to grow as a lyricist. With the tempos slowed and the layers of instrumentation largely stripped away, there's little left to hide the clunkiness of the former track's chorus (""Everything is moving so fast/ I am unlimited"") or the awkwardness of the latter song's central metaphor (which involves Toronto's CN Tower). With ""Stealing Tomorrow"" and elsewhere, Dekker tends to adhere too readily to the strict verse structures dictated by the music-- to color neatly within the lines he establishes for himself, so to speak. While the man's voice, with its engaging mix of agelessness and vulnerability, is perfectly suited to the Swimmers' sound, it would be nice to hear him stretch a bit, to sometimes force the music to keep up or play counterpoint rather than consistently meeting it halfway. Yet Channels has its share of strong lyrical moments, from the well-crafted hand-reading imagery of ""Palmistry"" to the firmament-breaching poetry of ""Still"" to the soul-searching of ""River's Edge"". And despite the relative ""accomplished-ness"" of it all, the record does offer some pleasant surprises: particularly ""New Light"", tucked away near the record's end, which has a crepuscular quality to it that should pique the ears of any Pinetop Seven fans out there. Altogether, Lost Channels marks a step forward for the Swimmers, one that-- along with their relentless touring (and there's no questioning the indie-ness of that)-- should be sufficient to keep their star on the rise.","Tony Dekker's project takes a swing at the big leagues with ambitious arrangements, slicker production, and a band that emerges front and center.

Eats Darkness,Apostle of Hustle,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a410c0084474cd0c03f8/1:1/w_160/036e0ac7.jpg,2009-05-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13018-eats-darkness/,Arts & Crafts,"On his third full-length LP, Eats Darkness, Apostle of Hustle's Andrew Whiteman all but eradicates the Cuban tres, the instrument that had been the lone distinguishing characteristic of his rather nebulous music. The band is now a power trio, with Julian Brown on bass and Dean Stone on drums. In jettisoning his reliance on Cuban and Brazilian folk traditions, Whiteman has discovered a new musical personality that is both more prosaic and more sharply defined: Eats Darkness rocks harder than prior work, with crisper edges, while feeling more playful and adventurous. It works when Whiteman sticks to his indie-rock comfort zone. He has an unremarkable voice and a sketchy track record when it comes to memorable melody, but he also has a real knack for tooling terrific parts. It's admirable how his best songs outstrip his resources by sheer diligence; plenty of musicians have done less with more. ""Eazy Speaks"" is a great example of Whiteman packing salient details into a brisk, approachable framework. It zips right along on a crafty riff filled with decorative hitches and fillips. ""Soul Unwind"" is another winner, its titular refrain unfurling like a victory banner above cascading guitars and tweaky studio embellishments. ""Xerses"" gets a long way on its lyrical bassline alone. When Whiteman ventures further afield in his songwriting, the results range from tepid to occasionally execrable. The title song pairs a weak-tea IDM track with thin-toned electric guitar noodling to zero effect. Nearly a third of the album's 13 tracks are given over to second-rate DOOM-style sample collages, using sound effects and the voices of artists such as Stan Brakhage and Kenneth Patchen in rather facile ways. They recreate the insane rapper's culture-as-playground sensibility without tapping into his eerie, subtle logic, and while they give the record what passes for a vague conceptual center-- revolutionary, society-in-decline stuff that is borne out in lyrics derisively peppered with the names of corporations-- they also convey a sense of unappealing sanctimony while obscuring the album's through-line. And then there's ""Perfect Fit"". There comes a moment of truth in every indie rocker's life when he thinks, ""Gee, I should try my hand at a sort of dub reggae song."" Ideally, he shares this thought with a trusted friend who shakes him by the shoulders until he relents. Whiteman must have kept it to himself, or maybe he just has unshakable shoulders. Either way, indie-reggae doesn't look good on anyone. I can't help but think more could've been done. Didn't anyone notice that he was experimenting with excessive vocal reverb and stabby guitar delay? Might his bandmates have caught him browsing Peter Tosh comps at the record store and intervened? Where were the parents in all of this? ""Perfect Fit"" is also emblematic of the album's shaky coherence-- when there is both peppy indie-rock and ponderous pseudo-reggae, how can the center hold? As a whole, Eats Darkness feels haphazard in a way that shades into self-indulgence. Its adventurous spirit is culpable for its moderate highs and lows alike. It's overstuffed, sure, but prune out the interstitials, ""Perfect Fit"", and a couple of the weaker indie-rock tracks, and a generously portioned EP of sturdy, calculatedly raucous tunes remains.","Third album from the Toronto-based project contains stabs at indie rock, sample-based collage, and something in the neighborhood of dub reggae.

Around the Well,Iron & Wine,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42db1335d7bf16988c7/1:1/w_160/2c315559.jpg,2009-05-20 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13041-around-the-well/,Sub Pop,"To this point in his career, Sam Beam has made progressively fuller, more musically complex, and, in this writer's opinion, better albums each time out. 2007's T**he Shepherd's Dog was a complete realization of the full-band sound he'd been building up to in his live shows, his collaboration with Calexico, and to a lesser degree on his recordings; as such, it felt like a milestone. So it seems like a good time to pause and look back at the old county road that runs parallel to the highway of Beam's albums and compile some rarities for the fans. ""For the fans"" doesn't necessarily mean hardcore types-- if you've liked any of Iron & Wine's albums so far, you'll almost certainly like this, but it's also probably not the first thing to buy. The 2xCD set covers his career to date, from his earliest solo acoustic material to his later, blown-out productions with Brian Deck, who has a knack for appropriately housing the kind of hushed, ramshackle tunes Beam writes. The chosen tracks range from B-sides and compilation cuts to previously unreleased sessions, and all are out of print. Beam's quiet home recordings are housed on Disc One, while his studio creations are on Disc Two. Your favorite Iron & Wine album will likely determine which disc you spend more time with, but for me, Disc Two is where the greatest treasures lie. Beam's more sonically adventurous period is well-documented on that disc, which features four outstanding tracks recorded for the film In Good Company. ""Communion Cups & Someone's Coat"" sports beautifully layered vocals, while ""Belated Promise Ring"" holds even with nearly any Iron & Wine album track with its softly ingratiating melody. They're appetizers for the nine-minute opus ""The Trapeze Swinger"", though, which is one of those songs that, in spite of all its finery-- the layered backing vocals, the steady, stomping rhythm, the memorable melody-- reminds you how simply powerful a well-chosen chord progression will be. Beam's casual conception of the graffiti on the gates of heaven-- ""We'll Meet Again"", ""Fuck the Man"", and ""Tell My Mother Not to Worry""-- are the kind of rich lyrics that reward close listening. Outside the tracks for that film, there's still plenty more to love. ""Kingdom of the Animals"" is a wonderful slow country number, with a two-step rhythm and vivid imagery: ""Jenny was gone and the moon blooms all shining/ As we dragged our panic up and down the riverbed/ Sweating wild and weird in our Sunday clothes."" The banjo-driven ""Serpent Charmer"" kicks up a dusty racket, while the vocals on ""Carried Home"" are so stretched out and lush that the song practically qualifies as ambient music. On his solo acoustic version of New Order's ""Love Vigilantes"", he actually captures the melody more powerfully than Bernard Sumner himself did. Over on Disc One, there are three additional covers, as Beam takes on the Flaming Lips' ""Waiting for a Superman"", Stereolab's ""Peng! 33"", and the Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights""-- alas, his most beloved song-- though none is particularly revelatory. His similarly styled cover of the Four Tops' ""The Same Old Song"" isn't included for some reason, but it's a better example of a cover that reveals something unexpected about the original. His originals fare quite a bit better. ""Dearest Forsaken"" has his trademark whisper falsetto with a bit of overdubbed slide guitar and banjo to heighten the atmosphere. One of Beam's earliest originals, ""Sacred Vision"", reveals him as a writer whose talent developed quickly. The simple melody and guitar picking are basic enough but create an intimate setting for lines like, ""There's no way to grow that don't hurt."" Around the Well is a great retrospective that heps fans to a lot of difficult-to-locate material from one of this decade's finest songwriters. While there is some fairly flat stuff on the first disc, it really gives the listener the sweep of his development as a writer, musician, and arranger. It also works as a nice palate cleanser for wherever Beam takes his muse next. He's such a prolific writer and recorder that it seems likely he's already begun producing things for his next odds'n'sods comp. Hopefully it will be as good as this one.","This 2xCD rarities set covers Sam Beam's career from solo acoustic stuff to full-band songs; unlike most odds'n'sods collections, it isn't for fans only.

Death Control,Night Control,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42a13d1975652138c55/1:1/w_160/60f1b9f0.jpg,2009-05-19 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13039-death-control/,Kill Shaman,"Rosemead, Calif. is a strip-mall-paved L.A. county outlier best known as corporate HQ for a massive electric utility-- in other words, not the independent rock petri dish of Silver Lake (or Brooklyn or Portland). Rosemead resident Christopher Curtis Smith's Night Control project nevertheless seems to have tapped some kind of underground spring of hip influences. A non-exhaustive-- but definitely exhausting-- roll call of listener-reported RIYLs includes: My Bloody Valentine, David Byrne, Brian Eno, Pavement, Kurt Vile, the Microphones, Ariel Pink, Sebadoh, Neil Young, Cheap Trick, Wavves, Olivia Tremor Control, the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Velvet Underground (inevitable), and Michael Jackson (not so much). If you hadn't heard a note of the 19-track, 74-minute debut loooong-player Death Control, you'd be forgiven for expecting an overflowing sonic rubbish tip. Sure, Night Control makes the new wave of noise bands (including L.A.-proper cool kids No Age and Abe Vigoda) seem like champions of coherence and clean production. And considering that Death Control compiles tracks cherry-picked by label Kill Shaman from a decade's worth of unreleased CD-Rs, I suspect that, left to his own devices, Smith boasts the same self-editing skills as Robert Pollard or Ryan Adams. But there's some method to this madness (besides a presumably awesome record collection). Neat pop containers keep Night Control's frothy blender drinks of synthesized instruments, distorted vocals, field recordings, and playback flotsam from spilling all over the place. For its disheveled strumming, sci-fi sound effects, and OCDed shaker, a track like ""Star 129"" is a traditionally structured composition whose songcraft and melody only become sharper and more poignant on repeat listens. ""Good Looks""' intro of listless beats and surging guitar gives way to the album's most winsome pop song, and white-boy bluesy ""Star 131"" sounds like a 3 a.m. cover of a lost Led Zeppelin ballad, replete with drunk, heartsick Robert Plant impersonation. Don't ask me if Night Control's lyrics make good on the music's soulful sounds, because Smith's vocals are machine manipulated beyond my patience for transcription. Unlike the vast majority of bedroom recorders, Smith doesn't seem keen to share his specific pain (to which I say, thank you, dude!). In fact, some of the album's best efforts, ""Two Hard"" and ""You're Nine"", are virtual instrumentals, sequenced for maximum effect to provide a respite from chaotic tunes like the Alan-Vega-stranded-in-a-Texas-roadhouse pastiche, ""Know Thy Peasant"". Despite its carnival pleasures, ""Peasant"" brings me back to Death Control's most intriguing artistic choice and biggest shortcoming-- after their third or fourth appearance, the massively reverbed vocals lose their intimacy. It's tempting to declare such art-school tendencies, especially in light of Smith's gift for hooks, pretentious. Yet his obvious enthusiasm and dedication to assembling such intricate mixes scuttles that argument. Eight-and-a-half-minute closer ""For the Lanes"" pits a spoken-word track against a funeral organ, finger-picked guitar, and what sounds like construction work, continually frustrating melodic or narrative thread-picking, yet mysteriously coalescing into passages of haunting beauty. I could mention John Fahey's tape collages or rattle off a dozen other reference points. But that would only obscure the fact that Night Control is a strong and original new voice in its own right.","With an exhaustive list of influences of sonic touchstones, this California one-man project is sprawling in ways only homemade record-geek types can be.

You could make the same criticisms of it that guys like me tend to make of Jeffrey Lewis-- the recording is almost entirely a delivery system for the words, it's hard to imagine anyone listening to it just for the sounds, and his voice mostly sticks to one or two notes-- but it also happens to be one of my favorite tracks of 2008. Music doesn't have to be about pure sound; used to be it was about emotional connection, too. ""I still don't have a cell phone/ But this seashell gets reception,"" Lewis sings on ""To Be Objectified"", a surf-splashed meditation from the neurotic New York singer/songwriter's latest album,Â 'Em Are I. Like Richman, Lewis is a sharp firsthand observer of what passes for urban bohemia, but one who still puts warts-and-all sincerity before hipster chic. It's an approach that can lead to uneven results, including Lewis' grossly misguidedÂ 12 Crass Songs covers disc in 2007. If you're reading this far, though, then Lewis (also, incidentally, an accomplished cartoonist) probably has at least a few songs that will resonate with you. As on 2006'sÂ City & Eastern Songs, Lewis' fourth album of original material again connects best through lyrical details. For instance, Lewis describes the way ""a rolled sweatshirt makes the window soft"" on ""Roll Bus Roll"", the album's lush, loping ramshackle-folk reverie about having too much past and leaving the city behind. Wesley Willis never had a Greyhound bus ride like this. The garage-rockers aren't far behind, whether Lewis is mustering up an unusual degree of self-confidence on opener ""Slogans"" (""Everyone you meet is not better than you"") or extending a sadomasochistic but evocative relationship metaphor on ""Broken Broken Broken Heart"". If the arrangements aren't special in their own right, ""Well, it's hard to get too bored/ When you pick the right two chords,"" as Lewis murmurs on ""If Life Exists (?)"", before discovering that no number of girlfriends will make him happier. But graveyard hoedown ""Whistle Past the Graveyard"" almost ruins some relatively droll commentary about the afterlife with bah-ing backing vocals. Barnyard themes also sink the Pearls Before Swine in-joke on ""Good Old Pig, Gone to Avalon"". Eight-minute jazz-noise freakout ""The Upside-Down Cross"" eventually gets to lyrics about traveling with various women, but it's not worth the trip; finale ""Mini-Theme = Moocher From the Future"" mistakes ""yesterday to no-terday"" for a clever pun. SoÂ 'Em Are I is a frontloaded album. But anyone who ever bought a Sebadoh record despite really liking only Lou Barlow's songs should still consider checking it out. (You can prefer Eric Gaffney's songs, that's okay, but not me.)","Neurotic New York singer/songwriter's latest album again connects best through lyrical details.

It's Frightening,White Rabbits,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a429ea9e61561daa4e3a/1:1/w_160/ce39b584.jpg,2009-05-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13038-its-frightening/,TBD,"In 2007, six guys who wore stylish suits, stood in the backs of stylish bars, and still said ""dance card"" came out of Columbia to a fair bit of critical notice. Don't worry, you didn't sleep through anything: White Rabbits were Brooklyn-via Columbia,Â Missouri, not University, and their pop was big and brassy instead of mellow and breezy. They might have been more Walkmen than Whit Stillman, but White Rabbits knew how to be formal, nonetheless. Fort Nightly was an assured, occasionally very good debut, but it was also just stylistically traditionalist enough to render it somewhat anonymous in relation to the trendier members of the attention economy. Enter Britt Daniel, and meetÂ It's Frightening. When White Rabbits started thinking about recording their second album, they'd been friendly with the guys in Spoon for a while, and even a slight listen toÂ Nightly suggests Daniel saw tons of raw material to work with. And work he did: Daniel didn't just produceÂ Frightening, he served as its songwriting Svengali from the earliest stages, cuttingÂ Nightly's urbane pop with the cryptic artiness ofÂ Gimme Fiction. Daniel's ghost lingers particularly strongly on ""Lionesse"", ""They Done Wrong/We Done Wrong"", and ""The Salesman (Tramp Life)"", which casual fans could be excused for confusing with actual Spoon songs. All the elements are here: theÂ in medias res studio chatter and expressionistic, dubby sound effects; the gloomy, resonant left-hand piano chords; the clippy acoustic guitars. Singer Stephen Patterson-- whose vocalsÂ are less impressive than on the debut-- even rolls the occasional consonant and slips seamlessly into a near-falsetto at appropriate moments. They're painting with the grain a bit, but that's okay: It's a good trail to walk down, and White Rabbits show themselves as eager, attentive prodigies. LikeÂ Fiction, and apropos of its title,Â Frightening can be dark and cavernous when it wants to. Indeed, it's that Poe-ish sense of lonesome, luxurious dread threading through the record that separates it most starkly fromÂ Nightly. Patterson cries out for someone to justÂ listen to him, he dreams of the curtains catching fire and lighting up the room, he focuses on the vent of light spreading across the floor from under the doorway. The eerie, solemn vibe swallowsÂ Frightening as it closes, when ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Leave It at the Door"" dive deeply into the shadows, letting the album slowly dissolve out like a lengthy crane shot slowly tracking backwards.Â  At the end of a record that clocks in at just over a half-hour, though, I will admit to checking my watch once or twice in the last few minutes. I was antsy only because the rest of the album had packed such a punch to that point, though.Â Frightening often sounds spooked, but the guys are still as cocksure as prizefighters, most of their arrangements packing enough polyrhythms for three regular songs. They come out swinging from the opening bell on ""Percussion Gun"", one of this year's best-yet opening tracks. Under the surface, it's a simple song about crumbling relationships, with clever lyrics (""Where do you get off/ And how can I get there, too?""). The band hits first with the arrangement, though, weaving a seething guitar/piano combo in and out of an incessant floor-tom rhythm redolent of Adam & the Ants' ""Kings of the Wild Frontier"". ""Gun""Â segues perfectly into ""Rudie Fails"", which keeps pushing forward, but with a broader purpose. Playing his Clash card before cashing out, Patterson sighs, ""While everyone's duking it out and taking names/ Well, I'll just take a number,"" before proclaiming over and over, ""I don't care at all!"" It's a way of making punk nihilism sound... strangely manageable, but this sort of refraction is the register in which White Rabbits work best. The script might contain plenty of familiar elements, but they're ably, and occasionally superbly, shuffled and recast.","White Rabbits debuted in 2007 to Spoon comparisons; now they've doubled down on those by enlisting Britt Daniel as producer.

Within the world of indie rock, he's carved him a niche all his own with clean but inventive production and lyrics that spend much of their time in the heads of unique characters. Vanderslice makes thoroughly modern pop, cut through with concerns about terrorism, disease, our ever-growing distance from nature, and our addiction to mass media. Even without varying his basic formula much, he manages to stay interesting from album to album. Romanian Names, his seventh solo record, is no exception, and it also happens to contain some of the best songs of his career. Though you'd never guess this was anyone but Vanderslice, and the sound is consistent with earlier records, Romanian Names has a somewhat different feel. The production (a joint venture with long-time collaborator Scott Solter) is as meticulous as ever, but there's something about these songs that feels more natural, as if they took less effort to write but still came out just as good. Perhaps it's simply timing-- Vanderslice has moved well beyond the post-9/11 dread that dominated Pixel Revolt and Emerald City, and his voice seems to appreciate the shift in tone. That's most clearly in evidence in the glowing falsetto harmonies of lead track ""Tremble And Tear"", the most beguiling opener of any of his albums yet. The big, descending melodic hook is joined by a Robert Fripp-ish guitar part, and Vanderslice balances the big vocal with a sparse bassline and sharp drums-- the snare is the only hard sound in an otherwise pillowy song. The record's second half has some immediately bracing indie-pop songs in the easy-going ""Sunken Union Boat"" and absurdly fluid ""Carina Constellation"", the latter of which features Vanderslice's best self-harmonization on the album, with lyrics that seem to be about two people getting off scot-free for a crime they really committed. Those songs' down-tempo counterparts are often just as good. The title track is sung from the perspective of a man in love with a gymnast whose pressurized life might finally be getting the best of her. The ghostly pulse of ""Forest Knolls"" frames a quiet rumination from Vanderslice as he looks out the window at some deer in the yard, realizing he'd never know what to do if he had to hunt for his own food and lashing himself with guilt for losing the knowledge of his ancestors. There are plenty more moments to enjoy on Romanian Names, from the bounce of ""C&O Canal"" to the electro campfire sing-along of ""D.I.A.L.O."", the slow back-to-nature majesty of ""Too Much Time"" and the lonely cello that closes the album. Vanderslice hasn't made a bad record, but he's only made a couple that are this good. If you've never dipped an ear into his world before, Romanian Names is a great place to do it.","Singer-songwriter John Vanderslice is consistent almost to a fault, but here he sounds relatively loose and natural, resulting in one of his better records.

But did you know that after ""We Made You"" hit the airwaves, major networks ran segments on whether Eminem's ""controversial"" new video went too far? Let's think big picture here: In some corners of the indie community, people quibble about whether Wavves are overhyped, even though 99% of America have absolutely no fucking clue who they are. Eminem is divisive the way BIG people are. Like A-Rod. Or George W. Bush. Relapse makes it abundantly clear where the line gets drawn in 2009. It's appropriate that the title character from ""Stan"" has become web argot for ""obsessive fanboy,"" because Eminem drives both Stan and stan alike crazy in the same exact way-- by completely ignoring them until it's too late to make amends. Star Trek isn't the only franchise reboot expected to do big numbers this summer-- instead of the 13-year-old who got into The Slim Shady LP and found that underground shit he did with Scam, Relapse is for that guy's little brother who's 13-years old right now, and Eminem is fully committed to upping the ante for today's desensitized sensibilities. Do a double-take when he rapped ""I just found out my mom does more dope than I do""? This time, you get to untangle the knotty word thickets of ""My Mom"", wherein young Marshall gets bullied and tricked by you-know-who into an addiction to prescription pills. Recoil when he threatened to push a fat girl off the high dive in swim class? He's now murdering his cousin in a tub and drinking the bathwater. Cringe at Eminem advocating roofies at a kegger? Get ready for the term ""felching"" to enter the public consciousness as Eminem gets anally raped by his stepfather in a tool shed. Got all that? Congrats, you're now four songs into Relapse. It's smart for Em to revert to the shock tactics of his glory days--Â Encore was a Chinese Democracy/HIStory-style catastrophe of self-exile with no real exit strategy. Though saddled with a terribly awkward rhythm that Eminem thankfully ignores, ""Underground"" finds him laying waste to a murderer's row of horror movie franchises with focused, devilish glee. If Relapse were Eminem in Michael Myers mode, it would be fantastic, but instead he's gone Mike Myers or even Robin Williams, subjecting us to ""wacky"" accents and a delusional sense that he still has a grip on what's edgy. Favoring a voice more staccato and pinched than ever, Eminem jacks off to Hannah Montana, hunts Lindsay Lohan for sport, sings about Valium in Auto-Tune, clowns Jessica Simpson, and raps a verse in character as Christopher Reeve. Much like The Love Guru, it's so painfully unfunny that you can't even bother to act offended. And then there's ""Bagpipes From Baghdad"". As with much of the record, you have to get past your initial inclination to absolutely not give a shit about a deader than dead topic, but when Eminem spits poison at Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, he comes off as so annoying and misguided that you end up taking Mimi's side. On ""If I Had"", Em rapped that he was ""tired of hearing people say they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs."" He begins ""My Mom"" by rapping ""I know people are tired of hearing about my mom,"" before rattling off one of the record's many choruses that are catchy in the way all grating but effective hooks are-- ""my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs."" As for the singles, well, they're still here, but fortunately lacking any visual component. As easy as it is to ride Eminem for such sub-Jackie Harvey cultural mockups, it's possible to argue in his defense that instantly dated references have been part of the package since day one (Spice Girls, Tom Green, etc.). Truth is, the tracks where Eminem turns on himself usually end up carrying the water, and it's no different on Relapse: ""Deja Vu"" explains in exhaustive, darkly comedic detail how he managed to disappear in a cocktail of nearly every available intoxicant for the past Olympiad before summarizing, ""See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath."" Immediately after, it feels like Relapse hits something of a stride with ""Beautiful"", the ""what do I think of success? It sucks"" rant, succeeding despite clichÃ©s both metaphorical (if you're doing ""woe is me,"" pick ""tears of a clown"" or ""walk in my shoes,"" not both) and musical. It's been easy to rag on the musical aspect of Eminem's recent output, and the mere fact he's working with Dr. Dre is seen as cause for celebration (the entirety of ""Old Time's Sake"" is great). But ever since ""In Da Club"" (and probably because of it), Dre has treated production like a test run for his very expensive headphones, concerning himself with only the most inert, stainless steel sounds. But you don't have to be an audiophile to find fault with the music here-- just a person who has a passing familiarity with Dre's post-2001 output. Relapse can be an intermittently thrilling sonic experience until you realize everything sounds like a variation of ""What's the Difference"", ""If I Can't"", or even fucking ""30 Something"". Granted, Eminem can overpower any beat by sheer force of will, but would it hurt for it to at least sound fun? Which is really the reason I can't truly dig Relapse, even with all the temptation to do so: When Eminem's on (""Underground"", ""Must Be the Ganja"")-- and he is more often than he's been since 2002-- he can put you in an awfully forgiving mood. Sure, the singles end up being the worst tracks, and it's chocked with filler and has almost no sense of sequencing, but that's the case with all of his albums. Eminem's always been able to manipulate notÂ only his alter egos but his public persona, but here it feels more forced than ever-- as though, as The Onion once quipped about a past-his-peak Marilyn Manson,Â Em's going door to doorÂ trying to shock people. Sure, it's great to have the guy back, if only due to the fact that if we get to ignore him forÂ the next four years. But it'll be on our terms, not his.","It's the return of the... Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding: Eminem's relapse is just an update of his shock tactics? It still beats most of Encore.

Fake Surfers,The Intelligence,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a414c0084474cd0c0401/1:1/w_160/578a1a64.jpg,2009-05-18 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13021-fake-surfers/,In the Red,"It'd be stupid to call your band the Intelligence without showing signs of progress and evolution. And over the course of four albums, the now full-time project of ex-A Frames drummer Lars Finberg has loosened up its formative post-punk pessimism to the point that the band's chosen MySpace URL-- www.myspace.com/theworldisadrag-- feels more ironic with each record. Rather than simply protest the indignities of modern life, on Fake Surfers, Finberg goes about creating a sanctuary from it, inviting in friends from fellow unsung West Coast indie rock acts (and, in one instance, covering their songs) to form a secret, protective society that will ensure the survival of rational-thinking species in a world where brain cells are being eroded 140 characters at a time. The Intelligence's previous release, 2007's Deuteronomy, was notable for its more focused songcraft and cleaner presentation, but Fake Surfers doesn't continue these new adventures in hi-fi. Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peak-level lo-fi sonics, emphasizing a connection between post-punk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence. (That said, Fake Surfers practically sounds like Dark Side of the Moon compared to Crepuscule With Pacman, a concurrently released collection of more discordant, half-formed material issued via French indie Born Bad.) Fake Surfers' noise/pop affinities seemingly align it with the current lo-fi vogue fostered by Slumberland and Slitbreeze Records sets, with the tambourine-rattled ""Taxman"" strut of ""Tower"" and bobble-headed harmonies of ""Universal Babysitter"" suggesting mid-1960s Beatles had they been signed to Rough Trade Records in 1978. But the Intelligence are distinguished by the way they push the limits of their claustrophobic space; their most intriguing moments often result when they lay off the distortion pedal, exposing the creepy voices and radio frequencies that overwhelm the swinging-60s go-go groove of ""Saint Bartolomeu"" and the circular circus melodies driving the electro-stroll of ""I Hear Depression"". And while it seems like faint praise to say the best song on Fake Surfers is its lone cover, the breezily strummed rendition of L.A. new-wave hot dogs Wounded Lion's ""Pony People"" feels like the song Finberg's been waiting to sing his whole life. Lord knows what it says about the man that he's never sounded happier than when singing from the perspective of a centaur ""firing arrows into rabbits."" But in the case of Fake Surfers, such emotional breakthroughs are worth sacrificing a bunny or two.","Band led by A Frames drummer Lars Finberg here plays to extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped lo-fi sonics.

Sewn Together,Meat Puppets,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a426b1335d7bf16988b4/1:1/w_160/7d9899ce.jpg,2009-05-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13035-sewn-together/,Megaforce,"As with any band that survives 29 years of trauma-- even if much of that trauma was self-administered-- it's hard not to feel a flush of happiness when you read about the Meat Puppets' 21st-century trajectory (so far). It's truly great that the reunion of brothers Curt and Cris Kirkwood-- long delayed by addiction, prison, and general interpersonal mayhem-- has become an ongoing concern. Two albums in three years, and a healthy touring schedule: That's an admirable work rate even before you take the struggles of the recent past into account. But Cris' return to the fold, while hopefully a positive development for the brothers' relationship, has yet to fully revivify the Puppets' work. Like its predecessor, 2007's Rise to Your Knees, Sewn Together is competent psych-tinged rock, with only brief flashes of the zonked vocal and instrumental personality that lit up the band's first few records. Now, the sing-alongs work as such, rather than as inscrutable interpretations of country-pop. The guitar heroics are cleaned up and corralled in outros and breakdowns, rather than ambling from first minute to last in place of hooks (or even riffs). The vocal delivery fits the mood of each song, rather than perversely offering smoked-out murmurs or post-pubescent groans when a croon would better suit. So Sewn Together is gently rustic, occasionally (a bit) heavier than you might expect, and ready for any adult-leaning-but-alternative-friendly playlist. It's also pretty bland, and at worst banally melodramatic in ways that suggest the unfortunate arrival of the Meat Puppets power ballad. The piano and Spanish guitar of ""Sapphire"" are prime-time soap unctuous; ""Go to Your Head"" features possibly the most timid guitar solo Curt Kirkwood's ever played, and well-wrought harmonies in service of a chorus you'll forget two tracks later. Sure, no one but the delusional should be expecting (or desiring) a return to the violent ineptitude of ""In a Car"", but Sewn Together's weaker tunes feel too fussed-over and misguidedly concerned with middling displays of craft. But once intimidatingly idiosyncratic to teenage punks used to easy-to-replicate hardcore, the Meat Puppets had been transforming into something more alt-rock normative well before their breakup. Perhaps fans should best approach any new Puppets material as a chance to hear two long-estranged musicians revel in rediscovered chops, while enjoying the occasional playful nod to past excesses. Like the way the hazy, high-speed ""I'm Not You"" prettifies the thrashing bluegrass of Meat Puppets II, or the way the final minutes of ""The Monkey and the Snake"" recall the placid acid-folk wonders of Up on the Sun. Listening to these moments, you can't help but hope the brothers will loosen up a bit next time out.","With their second album in three years-- and a healthy touring schedule-- the Kirkwood Brothers are well and truly all the way back.

The Spinning Top,Graham Coxon,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a434b1335d7bf16988dd/1:1/w_160/6c7424b4.jpg,2009-05-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13047-the-spinning-top/,Transgressive,"""It was just like college, only it was a nicer guitar and a nicer lunch,"" Blur bassist Alex James writes at the end of his 2007 memoir. James is describing his first meeting ""in a couple of years"" with Graham Coxon, the woohooing Britpop survivors' then-estranged guitarist. That passage was yet another reason for dedicated followers of the band to keep betting on a full Blur reunion, now official. It also gives you a pretty good idea what you can expect from Coxon's seventh solo album: same bittersweet bundle of misery, posher palate. Coxon is not normally a guy you turn to for easy cubicle listening. In Blur, he was the punkish pedal-stomper with the noisy American indie-rock collection and skateboarding hobby. AfterÂ Parklife turned the group into pop idols, Coxon was the one who reacted with Kurt Cobain-ish dismay. As a solo artist, he has alternated between post-punk squall and folkie plaintiveness starting with 1998's extremely lo-fi Sky Is Too High-- like so many of the records he would've heard on John Peel's radio show, it was self-released. Longtime Blur producer Stephen Street has helped steer Coxon toward more broadly accessible power-pop on recent albums, most successfully 2004'sÂ Happiness in Magazines, without ever quite going middle of the road. The Spinning Top crashes into the median, and it barely budges for almost 70 trudging minutes. Blur are doing what every once-profitable band does these days-- hi, Led Zeppelin!-- and getting back together. Coxon is doing what so many other formerly fun musicians end up doing once they've exhausted their Satan-bestowed allotment of decent melodies and lyrics: Yes, it's some kind of concept album, apparently telling the story of a man's life from birth to death, though you wouldn't necessarily know it. Street produces again, and Robyn Hitchcock is among the guests, but even they can't make up for repetitive, one-dimensional songs-- mostly sleepy folk, occasionally fuzzy psych. If the sound quality is more consistent than in Coxon's rough early work, that just means when he stretches threadbare ideas past the breaking point, he'll be less likely to wake you. One thing intact: Coxon's guitar-playing. If his nuanced and head-smackingly emotive fretwork with Blur hasn't already convinced you he's among his generation's great guitarists, the sinuous finger-picking on otherwise fairly forgettable first single ""Sorrow's Army"" should send you back to ""This Is a Low"", ""Sing"", or ""Bugman"" with fresh ears. Coxon recently toldÂ Uncut he's a big fan of English folk guitar gods Bert Jansch, Davy Graham, and Martin Carthy, and he's certainly playing in their style here. On ""Perfect Love"", Coxon's folk-filigreed acoustic figure joins various Indian instruments to back double-tracked doggerel lyrics vaguely reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Annabel Lee"". ""Tripping Over"" is an interminable lullaby, but that electric guitar is sure purdy for the last minute or two. Listeners who've heard only Coxon's last couple of rockers, including 2006'sÂ Love Travels at Illegal Speeds, might not've been aware of his folkie streak, but it's been almost as much of an open secret as the fact Blur were eventually gonna reunite. ""I wish I could bring Nick Drake back to life,"" Coxon sang on his first non-Blur single, ""I Wish"". At least back then he had enough faith in his own lo-fi vision not actually to bite the late English folkie-- he left that to Beck. It's hard to imagine the Coxon of a decade ago singing phrases like ""baybay"" over rootsy verses in between ornamented choruses that get allÂ Bryter Layter about the rain (except in jest, a la Blur B-side ""Rednecks""). Likewise, opener ""Look Into the Light"" is nice enough, emphasizing the guitar's droning harmonics, but I can't decide if I just like it because the melody reminds me of Drake's ""Cello Song"". Joined by upright bass and piano on tracks like ""Feel Alright"", which is as bland as its title,Â The Spinning Top comes closer to Van Morrison, specificallyÂ Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl. In that case, the slow-motion classical guitar licks on ""Far From Everything"" are ""Beside You"" all by its lonesome. Coxon's main Blur songs, ""You're So Great"" and ""Coffee & TV"", could go as long as six minutes without a single wasted note.Â The Spinning Top keeps spinning its wheels. Second single ""In the Morning"" sounds like the Beatles' ""Blackbird"" if it had gone on for eight minutes and if Paul had let George arrange-- not just because Coxon mentions a blackbird, either. ""If a diamond hangs in every tree and a life is lost for every leaf can a bird still sing?"" he asks. Beats me. Even when the Blur guitarist reminds us that he knows where Syd Barrett lives, as on ""Caspian Sea"", it's not much more fun than bashing your head against the wall repeating geographical terms until every now and then you see stars. ""It's oh so serious/ It's oh so lame,"" Coxon repeats throughout ""If You Want Me"", occasionally breaking into Pixies-ish distortion-- serious or not, itÂ is kind of lame. Blur couldn't really be Blur without Coxon. His guitar helps makeÂ Modern Life Is Rubbish modern, keepsÂ 13 from collapsing under its own Donald Duck noises, and steals the show during its one appearance onÂ Think Tank. No Blur without him, either. But it's Damon Albarn who has had the band's most successful solo career, outselling Blur with Gorillaz and going on to even more artistically impressive work with the Good, the Bad & the Queen and then Monkey. James has been writing a weekly newspaper column; drummer Dave Rowntree went into politics. It's probably no coincidence that the song here most worthy of Coxon's past work is called ""Humble Man"". As James's memoir puts it, Coxon is ""brilliantly artistic, but vulnerable."" He's still my favorite Blur.","Blur guitarist again teams with producer Stephen Street for this, his seventh (!) solo album.

KitsunÃ© Tabloid,Phoenix,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a417b1335d7bf1698898/1:1/w_160/0b315c14.jpg,2009-05-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13024-kitsune-tabloid/,KitsunÃ©,"Phoenix's entire output makes me feel like I'm touring Europe's sexiest cities and smoking fancy cigarettes while in the throes of an ""arty"" tomboy model. Their choices for the second volume of the KitsunÃ© Tabloid series-- following Digitalism's 2008 mix-- one might assume would play on this aesthetic, out-cooling listeners with obscurant or ultra-hip selections. Instead, Phoenix turn in a modest and loving mixtape full of songs aimed at pricking ears rather than popping eyeballs.Â KitsunÃ© Tabloid openly displays Phoenix's love for all manners of charming, offbeat music: There's precious little crate-digging, in part because even if the average Phoenix fan doesn't know a lick about Tangerine Dream or the Red Krayola, it's likely that your average KitsunÃ© consumer does. If Tabloid has a discernible theme, it's probably Phoenix's reverence for early rock'n'soul, as the mix touches on not just the Impressions but Ritchie Valens, Irma Thomas, Dusty Springfield, and like-minded imitators Elvis Costello, Chris Bell (Big Star), and Dennis Wilson. Major stylistic diversions include R&B, Brazilian pop, and indie rock, but there's plenty of wiggle room to be had in that first list, and Tabloid never feels monotonous or truly predictable. KitsunÃ© Tabloid is weighed down by one or two too many long tracks, which makes it a little bit like a Phoenix album anyway. But even at its most tedious, Tabloid exposes commonalities between unlike partners, its careful sequencing revealing the swooning overlap between Costello's ""Shipbuilding"" and D'Angelo's ""Send It On"", or the fever-dreams shared by the Red Krayola's ""Victory Garden"" and the Impressions' ""I've Been Trying"". Tabloid even stumbles into the sublime, such as when its final coupling, Springfield's take on ""I Think It's Gonna Rain Today""-- and its keystone line, ""Human kindness is overflowing""-- and Lou Reed's ""Street Hassle"", dovetail into a warming thematic climax. Phoenix even manage to freshen up the 13thÂ Floor Elevators' ""I Had to Tell You"" and Wilson's ""Lady (Falling in Love)"", divorcing those songs from their often weighty contexts (though even four fashionable French rockers can't repurpose Urge Overkill, arguably this mix's most surprising selection). It's (only) a little unfair to read Phoenix's style in these choices-- this is a mixtape, not a list of influences-- but Tabloid does seem to favor long, pretty songs that eschew rigidity in favor of strands of repeated melody. See: Chris Bell's ""I Am the Cosmos"", Costello's ""Shipbuilding"", or Roxy Music's ""Pyjamarama"". Instrumental choices like Tangerine Dream's ""Love on a Real Train"" or Iggy Pop and James Williamson's ""Master Change"" are fitting for a band whose albums often include at least one mostly wordless epic.Â Tabloid only occasionally feels self conscious or over-considered, such as during its opening two songs, Kiss' instrumental ""Love Theme From Kiss"" and the Dirty Projectors ""Rise Above"", an awesome track that nonetheless carries an air of hot'n'now cred that the rest of the compilation avoids. But more than flashy or progressive or obscure, Tabloid feels considerate, at least as considerate as a mixtape made by four strangers for Vice-magazine readers can be. There are blatant stylistic disconnects in the sequencing; there are some long songs, silly songs, bad songs, and at least one song you've probably not heard (for me: Lo Borges' ""Aos Baroes""). All of this makes it very much like a mixtape one of your friends might pass you, which sort of suppresses my jetsetting fantasies as I pull over into an off-highway Chick-fil-a.","For the second volume in this KitsunÃ© series,Â Phoenix turn in a modest and loving mixtape full of songs aimed at pricking ears rather than popping eyeballs.

Animal Crack Box,Animal Collective,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a452c0084474cd0c047d/1:1/w_160/f6bf879a.jpg,2009-05-18 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13072-animal-crack-box/,Catsup Plate,"It's tempting to say that Animal Crack Box is for Animal Collective diehards only. In one sense, it's true-- the 1,000 copies of this 3xLP set were likely snapped up by the most committed and in-the-know fans. But its musical appeal might seem limited too, at least at first glance.Â The set is closest in style to two of the band's earliest, strangest releases, records they made when they were bubbling under from basement electronic and noise circles: 2002'sÂ Hollinndagain, a free-form collage of loops, chants, and ambience grafted together from live performances, and 2003'sÂ Campfire Songs, eerie acoustic improvisations recorded on a rural Maryland porch and drenched in the sounds of rain, wind, and chirping birds. In short, this is Animal Collective at a time when their peers were Black Dice at their most avant-garde and bands on Load Records; a time when they were a largely experimental concern far away from the worlds of songs like ""Fireworks"" and ""My Girls"". But even at its roughest, this inventive collection always sounds like Animal Collective, in ways any fan will recognize. Many of the signature elements they continue to rely on-- soaring vocals, repetitive rhythms, childlike melodies, buzzing electronics, eerie acoustics-- are in full bloom here. And though the set consists of material from their infancy (2000-2003), it sounds less embryonic than lab-like, as if their musical nucleus was there from the start, and their task was not to build a core but rearrange those atoms into infinite mutations. Much of that effect is due to excellent selection and sequencing. The band sifted through hundreds of live recordings and practice tapes, and divided the chosen material-- about 90 minutes worth-- into six cohesive, era-specific sides. Side B, for example, offers murky textures from the trio of Avey Tare, Panda Bear, and Geologist around the time of Hollinndagain; Side C, acoustic essays by Avey and Panda in the vein of Campfire Songs; and side E, full-quartet trance-rock later perfected on 2003's Here Comes the Indian. The result is wide variety that's rarely schizophrenic. Each side plays like a short story, and the shifts from heavy din to lonely plucks to whooping jams feel natural, much as they have across the band's career as a whole. The variety also gives Animal Crack Box a mood-ring quality. Which side you prefer will depend on which side of the band you like most, and maybe even on your state of mind. I'm partial to the noisier, denser material found on Side E-- particularly the fuzzy version of Indian'sÂ  ""Hey Light""-- and Side A, which peaks when the freneticÂ ""Ahhh Good Country""Â (originally heard on 2001'sÂ Danse Manatee) bleeds into the acidic march-band beat ofÂ ""Iko Ovo"". But the other end of the set's spectrum is just as entrancing. Take Side C, in which Avey and Panda trade patient vocals and sparse acoustic guitars, recalling the basement hymns ofÂ fellow East Coast experimental psych lords Tower Recordings. At side's end, a shorter take on Campfire Songs' ""De Soto De Son""Â sounds like a melodic version of Finnish avant-folk. That vibe is matched by the strum-happy Side F, taken mostly from the Avey/Panda duo tours that preceded the release of 2004's Sung Tongs. Those shows proved Animal Collective could sound just as surreal and hypnotic using simple acoustics as they could with electrified overload. Here we get a warped, back-and-forth take onÂ ""Who Could Win a Rabbit""Â and the hissy, Daniel Johnston-like spook ofÂ ""Mouth Wooed Her"". Other sides seem less essential, but none are boring. The predominant feel is meditative, sometimes gentle, catching the vibe of shows that even at their weirdest were, in person, user-friendly.Â Those sÃ©ance-like gigs often involved tribal beats, absurd masks, primal chants, and other ritualistic qualities designed to engage those in the room. The Animal Collective of the early 2000s could evoke a more spiritual version of the Sun City Girls, a modern take on Faust and Amon DÃ¼Ã¼l, or a less arty descendent of the Residents--Â but, as Animal Crack Box shows, the band offered a sunnier, more inclusive aura than any of those influences. None of this is news-- the periods and styles covered on Animal Crack Box have all popped up on previous releases. In that sense, it's simply a welcome addition to Animal Collective's rich body of work. But these are the rawest, most immediate glimpses of the band to date, stripped of the precision afforded by studio revision. If some of it sounds hazy, well, freeze frames from fast-moving films tend to look a little blurry, and Animal Crack Box vividly demonstrates how this band and its music are always a work in progress.","Animal Collective siftedÂ through hundreds of live recordings and practice tapes recorded between 2000 and 2003 to craft this 3xLP intro to their early years.

Tomorrow Today,Seeland,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a380ea9e61561daa4cba/1:1/w_160/aff19e18.jpg,2009-05-15 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12900-tomorrow-today/,LOAF,"Tim Felton and Billy Bainbridge released their first single as Seeland way back in 2005 on the Duophonic Super 45s mini-label, an imprint known for housing groups with functional-sounding names that fetishized the mundanity of music technology: Stereolab, Felton's band Broadcast, Imitation Electric Piano, Arcwelder. Even the name of Bainbridge's own cultishly admired former group Plone sounded onomatopoeic, like a reference tone seeping out of a 60s-era electronics workshop. The title of the duo's long-simmering first LP, Tomorrow Today, signals the same sort of retro-futurism, but they're pulling from a slightly different palette. Deciphering that palette is part of the fun, too. Plone's geekily majestic sci-fi mini symphonies barely register, and Broadcast's glassy analog grooves are all but invisible. Felton and Bainbridge named the project after track two fromÂ Neu! '75, and while there's a whiff of that song's guitar tone and sterile atmosphere, they're content to double-time its tempo-- only two songs on Tomorrow crack the four-minute mark. Hell, with the exception of theÂ Switched On organeering of ""Captured"", if someone were to play meÂ Tomorrow blindly, and tell me that it's ""Gruff Rhys making a Joe Meek tribute album,"" I wouldn't bat an eyelash. Felton's vocals distinctly recall Rhys' warm, fuzzy timbre; the songs-- at least on the first half of the record-- are immaculate, hook-laden new wave; and there's enough studio flim-flammery to drive me toward eBay and YouTube for a Meek fix. At its best, Tomorrow Today is top-notch romantic synth-pop with a weirdo edge. There's nothing paradigm-shifting here, but these two have never been known for reinventing the wheel as much as finding new ways to make antique wheels roll. The love songs are the best songs: ""Turnaround"" is gothy and gossamer, billowing synths surrounding a sunny-but-bashful melody that only slightly rises out of its daydream for the chorus, and ""Captured"" sets some punny Numan/Kraftwerkisms (""I will not be turned off"") to an upshifted tempo and a rhythm bed set to puree. But there's a darker side, too. Opener ""Burning Pages"" may burst out of its dispassionate frame with a pitch-jumping chorus, but that chorus is __""__Burning pages, nothing more,/ Life will leave you, of that i'm sure."" ""Hang on Lucifer"" is, well, called that, and does contain the creepy line ""In the light that leads to a blindness, he crept in, quietly serene,"" but its chippy guitars and non-stop sound effects button-pushing makes it, like ""Colour Dream"", sound like an early-century SFA demo. Tomorrow remains compelling through ""Static Object"", the record's closest thing to a Joy Division moment, but then limps out over its last third, mired in a tone/tempo bog that reveals the group's soft spots and least-appealing features. ""Pretty Bird"" and ""Station Sky"" pack plenty of studio whirlygigs, but they lack either compelling hooks or a propulsive rhythm. ""Call the Incredible"" is Seeland's idea of a slow-building dramatic epic, and a lyric like __""__You can be anything that you choose, it's up to you"" indicates how much the whole bit feels like a phone-in. They started the LP by showing a refreshing knack for cranking out effortlessly catchy patch-cord pop, then end it by falling victim to the preset function. In terms of prolificacy, their definitions of ""tomorrow"" and ""today"" seem to only loosely resemble my own, but if they want to take less than five years to record a followup, I'd be more than happy to see LP two lean more toward the earlier part of this record than the later.","Ex-Plone man Billy Bainbridge has a tinge ofÂ retro-futurist fetishism, but he and Seeland partner Tim Felton's music pulls from a decidedly different pallette.

Free Drugs;-),Harlem,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc7ea9e61561daa7799/1:1/w_160/46a7ece8.jpg,2009-05-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12891-free-drugs-/,Female Fantasy,"Transplanted from Tucson to Austin, the band Harlem are clearly accustomed to high temperatures. Every song of theirs burns bright, blending sordid premises, drunken technique, and the exploded sounds of dive-bar rock'n'roll. The music is being sold, ironically, under the name Free Drugs;-)-- but don't let the adolescent title and cutesy emoticon steer you away. Part of a noisy new crop of revivalists-- the umpteenth generation of Lenny Kaye acolytes-- Harlem's record nevertheless strikes out as a marvel of cartoonishly masculine, crudely analog brevity. Reviewers have treated the band's professed love of Nirvana as a half-joke, and given their affectedly dumb deflections of interviewers' questions, it's no wonder. But like most in their generation, Harlem's appreciation of Lead Belly can likely be traced to Kurt Cobain's own love for the bluesman, made famous in his unplugged rendition of ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"" There are not only echoes of Lead Belly's chorus in Harlem's ""Red Herring"", but hints of Nirvana's noise-pop forebears, Pixies, in the haunting harmonies. Apart from those moody pre- and post-industrial genres, countless others can be spotted: surf rock Ã¡ la the Ventures, Sun Records rockabilly, and overdriven Detroit proto-punk. ""I'm on Drugs"" crams the fractured pace of junkiedom into two minutes. Fuzzy and brief as the altered states they are singing about, the song has the thickened intensity, to use a more family-friendly metaphor, of a slow gravy reduction. Play ""Witchgreens"" for another instance of the band's inability to waste time: They slap together the bare bones of a pop song, a slinky groove, and a silken shout, and manage to sneak their chorus into your memory. When they demand more room to move, they stretch the track to a relatively epic three minutes in ""South of France"", giving them the precise acreage needed to quarter an army of crazy rhythms, one slyly submerged melody, and an apocalyptic breakdown worthy of Black Francis. So is it sincere? Are they trying too hard? It is too soon to tell. What cannot be denied, even at this early stage, is the charm behind Harlem's to-hell-with-everything swagger. In songs like ""Beautiful & Very Smart"" and ""Disneyland"", their primitivism extends from sounds to emotions, as they plead sweetly for girls to simply hang around and talk to them. Ultimately, it is hard to judge them against their aesthetic brethren-- Sic Alps, for instance, or the Black Lips-- when chops and studio polish are erased from the equation. Even without clever language or arrangements, their elemental yearning for teenage kicks makes up for that. They may not be adding much to the neo-Nuggets formula, but their channeling of those fuzzed-out relics of rock history is so painstakingly slipshod, so studiedly aggressive, and so exuberantly ominous, that listeners won't give a fig about the lack of novelty.","Part of a noisy new crop of Lenny Kaye acolytes, Harlem offer a charming to-hell-with-everything swagger.

Ballads,Ekkehard EhlersPaul Wirkus,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44fc0084474cd0c0477/1:1/w_160/5fa7163d.jpg,2009-05-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13069-ballads/,Staubgold,"In the percussionist Paul Wirkus, Ekkehard Ehlers has found a kindred spirit: equally restless and equally intelligent. From the thistly early stretches of their new collaboration, it is clear both musicians have an appetite for lo-fi deconstruction, a weakness for austerity, and, in that always refreshing Staubgold spirit, a bottomless well of ideas for the glitch.Â Ambitiously linking to a grand Western tradition, one broad enough to accommodate both Robin Hood and Casey Jones, the album title Ballads hints at Ehlers' habit of appropriation. Critics like New York's Jerry Saltz believe that, even today, the concept looms large over the art world, casting a shadow that obscures its values. Certainly, at its bold best, appropriation gave us Warhol and rap: novel creations, biting comments, new avenues for the young to upset the old. But the vigor with which reviewers and consumers lapped it up led to overdemand, then to oversupply, of Xeroxed Pop, overworked breakbeats, by-the-numbers conceptualism. Thus much of the meaning and force once bound up with the act of appropriation-- that sense that no one owned culture, that everyone did, or simply that the wrong people did-- drained away. You could say that the glitch rose to a similar level of prominence as well, before it became part of everyone's schematic edginess. Where it once pointed to the broken promise of technology, or a human presence amid the machines, it eventually turned into a chic shortcut taken by every student of Ben Gibbard or Scott Herren. Ehlers and Wirkus lobby for a return to the not-so-remote past when both appropriation and the glitch held on to some form of expressive power. Toward the beginning of his career, Ehlers borrowed fragments of Schoenberg and, inspired by the Frankfurt School thinkers, glued them together into gorgeously jarring mosaics. Listeners turned into noticers when they encountered this early work, poring over the textures to connect Ehlers' theory to his practice, in a trend that continued with the train of tributes that make up Plays. There, each composition was prefixed with ""Ekkehard Ehlers Plays..."" and ended with iconic names like Albert Ayler and Robert Johnson, echoing the dramatic marketing of old recordings where a titanic pianist took on a titanic composer (think Horowitz Plays Rachmaninoff). The very opposite of a straightforward interpreter (think Robert Lowell), Ehlers' homages bore only a passing resemblance to the honorees, hewing closer to his own fractured dream logic. In his most explicit reference-- he prefers that term over ""sampling""-- his A Life Without Fear sought to recreate, in its creator's image, the perpetual nightfall of blues music. Whatever you want to call it-- referencing or sampling-- Ehlers ladles both Alice Coltrane and Henry Flynt into Ballads. In these fleeting studies, it is easy to miss the samples, which either sweep briskly in and out of vision, or shade neatly into the surrounding song. Often the same goes for the guest's instruments, notably Kai Fagaschinksi's clarinet, which can click with the rest of the moving parts into one interlocking whole. The contributions can serve as an invisible foundation at times, as firecracking flourishes at others. (The alternately heavy and light woodwind-string tensions of Politik Braucht Keinen Feind seem to have won Ehlers over.) You can hear Fagaschinki's minimalist presence in ""Bryza"", nicely evoking the breeze of its title. But the dueling double-bass drama carried out by Berlin's Tang and Dafeldecker, of course, is much easier to pick out. On the album's outstanding ""Guma"", the two men have it out, plucking and bowing, before a wild theater of sounds: a boat creak, slashing rotors, pneumatic spray, Wirkus' whisper of tribal drums. There is an ominous hint of violence in every corner of that nearly six-minute scene. Leaning more toward freeform improvisation, Ehlers goes out of his way to avoid loop structures here-- a decisive break with Wirkus' last two records. In fact, if you trace the flight-path of Wirkus' aesthetic from 2004's Inteletto d'Amore to 2006's DÃ©formation Professionnelle, essentially a Reichian layer cake of MiniDisc loops, an embrace of the near-mystic powers of rhythm seems to be the next stop. On the mysteriously neglected Forest Full of Drums (2008), Wirkus appropriated the rhythms and sounds of nature, dragging a drum kit into the woods. About the outdoor-recording process, Wirkus said: ""Everything was already there. The trees, the wind, the birds, the muddy soil, the undergrowth, playing children, people taking walks, the distant hum of a motorway, and airplanes above. We arrived there as beginners. We had to wait for the right weather."" Uncooperative weather kept Wirkus and Ehlers from repeating this Jewelled Antler style of production. In a way, this method is the extension of Mille Plateaux logic to its absurd extreme: the click, the cut, the glitch send us from the failed machine back to the edenic forms of nature. So it was no surprise that nature sounds found a way to intrude. The second track, ""Okno"", means ""window"" in Polish and, like the half-curtained panes on the record's cover, it opens up a narrow portal to the outside world. Wirkus is clearly harkening back to his last record, by prominently placing the wind, which sounds like it is flowing through metal chimes, and the birds, a swarm of chirps straight out of Messaien, in his rustic vision. Before long, this daydreamy section gives way to a more surreal blend, as percussive dials and pops swell into a carnivalesque explosion of notes and lowing cattle. Scientific order and detail abounds, but it is balanced by both members' free-jazz passion for chaos (in, for one, the lost-in-space tumult of ""Ruchy"") and drift (perfected in the soothing tremolo of ""Wiem""). This constant motion between precise blitzkrieg and restorative dÃ©tente sums up the partnership of Ehlers and Wirkus. One small quibble, which also applied to Forest Full of Drums: Almost all of these striking songs could use two or three extra minutes to unfold. Brevity is a virtue, but in the case of these two soundscape architects, listeners will wish the expansive ideas had expansive canvases.","Percussionist Paul Wirkus and experimental electronic musician Ekkehard Ehlers breathe new life into glitch.

Funcrusher Plus,Company Flow,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a411c0084474cd0c03fa/1:1/w_160/0cc77ccf.jpg,2009-05-15 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13019-funcrusher-plus/,Definitive Jux,"Listening to Company Flow is not a casual experience. ""We always drew people down the middle,"" El-P remarked in an interview with Pitchfork earlier this year. ""There were never people who were like 'Eh, it's all right.' It was either 'I wanna find those guys and beat them senseless because their crazy noise is hurting me' or 'This is fucking incredible.'"" But despite their divisive reputation, Company Flow had an important role as one of the last crucial bridges between the East Coast hardcore battle rap of the 1990s and the deep-end abstraction that was to follow in the transition from underground hip-hop to ""indie rap"". It's the kind of rap that was out-there enough to be aggressively polarizing, yet true enough to the game that no less a classicist than DJ Premier co-signed it. Looking back at the tracks that first appeared on 1996's Funcrusher EP and the additional material that supplemented it on Funcrusher Plus a year later, you can hear where many of those space-rap acolytes of the late 90s got their motivation (even if they frequently picked up their verbosity without retaining their b-boy bonafides). But you can also hear the precedents, harbored in the grimy beats and cipher-based shit-talk that has a stylistic younger-brother kinship with the likes of Organized Konfusion, D.I.T.C., and first-wave Wu-Tang. Now, after a few years in Rawkus-entangled out-of-print limbo, Funcrusher Plus has been reclaimed by Definitive Jux, brought back in a no-frills yet still-essential reissue that serves as a valuable reminder of how advanced MC/producers El-P and Bigg Jus and DJ Mr. Len were at the time-- and, well, now. If you're more familiar with their solo work, Funcrusher Plus might be a bit of a surprise lyrically. There are a few signs of the personal details that'd inform El-P's later material-- ""Last Good Sleep"", in particular, is a vivid, stomach-turning account of growing up being kept awake by domestic violence-- and subtle hints at the more culturally focused material Bigg Jus would develop in his later career, most clearly in the recollections of his graf-artist days in ""Lune TNS"". But for the most part, they're on some wall-to-wall battle-rap punchline business, and it's crafty, bewildering, repeat-rewind material. There's a defiantly sick sense of humor all throughout Funcrusher Plus, starting with the anti-child-molester safety record intro on opening track ""Bad Touch Example"" and extending through El and Jus' punchlines, which mash up pop-culture references, conspiracy theories, threats of physical trauma and independent, anti-industry broadsides into a mutant strain of hyper-crowded lyricism that borders on information overload. They're never content to lay an obvious, straightforward metaphor on the table; where average MCs might claim they ""shine like a light bulb,"" Bigg Jus' showcase verse on ""Silence"" has him ""encased in a glass dome, I pull mikes like filaments/ I'm tungsten, light within that causes somethin'."" If that reads like a parody of backpacker wordiness, on record it sounds like verbal swordsmanship. Other punchlines are a bit more to-the-point but no less audacious: ""I see through pussy like the invisible woman"" (El-P on ""Blind""); ""MCs couldn't hang if they was lynched by the Grand Dragon"" (Bigg Jus on ""8 Steps to Perfection""); ""Even when I say nothing it's a beautiful use of negative space"" (El-P on ""The Fire in Which You Burn""). But even more pivotal to their style than their punchlines is the way they're thrown at you: relentlessly, with a minimum of setup, weaving between clarity and abstraction until the two of them are blurred. Both Jus and El have deliveries that switch from traditional on-the-beat flow to a manic, hectoring semi-conversational tirade when you least expect it, a technique even more indicative of their anti-commercial stance than their prevalent fuck-a-label rhymes. It's all so dense and serpentine and intricate that pretty much every single attempt to transcribe it has left Funcrusher Plus' Original Hip-Hop Lyrics Archives entries riddled with question marks and mistakes. Twelve years and dozens upon dozens of listens after first buying it, I'm still catching new details. And aside from the lyrical epiphanies you might get from return visits, the other reason to keep Funcrusher Plus on rotation is its production, which boasts some of the most oxidized, tetanus-infected doom-rap beats of the era. With the exception of the nocturnal crystalline funk of the Bigg Jus-produced ""Lune TNS"" and the frequent scratch contributions from secret weapon DJ Mr. Len, Funcrusher Plus' beats bear the mark of El-P's dusty-but-digital aesthetic, which even back then had the same sort of beautiful-dystopia Blade Runner feel that informed Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein and his own Fantastic Damage a few years later. ""Krazy Kings"" and ""Blind"" explode with horn blasts amputated from brassy jazz and funk and turned into jeering exclamation points, ""Legends"" has this great woozy-sounding blues-funk lope to it that perfectly evokes late night smokin'-and-drinkin' surliness, and the vertiginous guitar loop in ""8 Steps to Perfection"" is such a stark example of psychedelic horror that sample-spotters might want to start looking in late-60s LSD-awareness educational films if they want to find its source. But no matter how close the atmosphere gets to nightmarish slasher-flick ugliness or bionic space-age futurism, the beats beneath still knock; everyone remembers that fuck-around-sounding three-note synthesizer riff from ""Vital Nerve"" but it's laid over this heavy-ass drum break that makes you want to just punch the hell out of something. Aside from some subtle remastering that thankfully still preserves the album's underground grit (like Bigg Jus' spit-via-intercom presence on ""Krazy Kings""), this edition of Funcrusher Plus isn't exactly deluxe. Some fans might be disappointed in this reissue for completist reasons-- it doesn't include ""Corners '94"", a highlight on the double-LP version, and there's no bonus disc of fan-favorite post-Funcrusher singles like ""End to End Burners"", ""Simple"", or ""Patriotism"". But it's still absolutely necessary, and not just for rights-reclamation reasons. As abrasive and confrontational as this album might've sounded in the Bentley-buying shiny-suit atmosphere of 1997, Funcrusher Plus seems both more vital and more unfathomable now: vital because its independent-minded ethos seems to be getting its long-awaited validation in the post-going-diamond era, and unfathomable because few of its practitioners have been able to extend this far out into the furthest reaches of abstract lyricism and still retain that classic b-boy connection.","Reissue of 1997 album serves as a reminder of how advanced El-P, Bigg Jus, and DJ Mr. Len were at the time and how well their take on hip-hop holds up now.

Crime Pays,Camâron,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41c13d1975652138c33/1:1/w_160/597cbe61.jpg,2009-05-15 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13029-crime-pays/,Asylum,"Our current financial difficulties haven't stopped the incessant need to find trends in anything, and the result has been dozens of publications proclaiming the fashionability of frugality. This has worked out extremely well for not only people who were cheap before it somehow became cool, but unexpectedly, for many rappers who have either passed their commercial peak or never really experienced one in the first place. No longer cowed by unrealistic expectations, either self-imposed or label-imposed, guys like Scarface, Styles P, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Slim Thug, and Jim Jones are putting out highly enjoyable, no-frills records with low overhead, proving all along that some rappers just need a decent beat and everyone else to stay out of their way. Crime Pays all but confirms that Cam'ron is not one of those rappers. Over the past half-year or so, leaks like ""I Hate My Job"" and ""Get It in Ohio"" suggested a possibility of a The *Wrestler-*styleÂ comeback narrative thatÂ derived power from admitting how far its protagonist had fallen. Instead,Â Crime Pays hasÂ a lonely, defensive, and vaguely desperate Kirk Van Houten vibe-- more noticeable than a lack of breakout bangers or guest spots (though you gotta wonder how 40 Cal was the biggest name to clear his schedule for the first Cam'ron record in three years) is a palpable and inexcusable lack of excitement and spark. Killa could stand to borrow a feeling. Seems like any time Cam isn't able to shout out the names of every inaugural member of DipSet, he retreats into the sort of insular (not to be confused with impulsive or impenetrable-- that would be more interesting) bad habits he's picked up since Purple Haze became arguably the last definitive document of popular New York rap. Earlier in the decade, beats from Just Blaze, Kanye, and Heatmakerz provided exquisite and posh soundtracks that added extra shine to Cam's theater of the absurd. But whether it's a reduced budget or his increased need to show allegiance to the Sun Belt states, Cam outsources most of Crime Pays to Araabmuzik and Skitzo. They contribute mixtape-quality music that goes heavy on repetitive Psycho strings and incessantly ticking 16th-note hi-hats but ultimately has about as much low end as a Junior Senior record. And not that I'd expect the guy who penned lines like ""take it in your ass-- how 'bout 30 grams?"" and the entirety of ""Stop Calling"" to give the most positive spin on gender relations, but even after all the poisonous misogyny we've heard Cam deal in up to this point, ""You Know What's Up"" and ""Cookies & Apple Juice"" are so mirthlessly repulsive that ""Bottom of the Pussy"" somehow becomes, like, the fifth-most offensive song on Crime Pays. At least Cam seems amused with himself on that track, which also explains how the comic high point of Crime Pays is a two-minute skit wherein Cam'ron threatens to shit in a woman's car-- it's a veritable Easter Egg for people who remember his second verse on ""Dead Muthafuckas"". Of course, when Cam disappears headlong up his own assonance (no ho-millz, as he helpfully instructs throughout) it's still incredibly entertaining. Even within the tightest rhyme stricture, his gamesmanship in spooling vowel sounds fascinates. Cam'ron's one of those kind of guys where you could read his lyrics on paper and know exactly how it sounds. If only his lyrics and cadence weren't saddled with such shabby beats-- even as they contain some of the least imaginative lines on Crime Pays, the relative levity of kiddie beats like ""Never Ever"", ""Silky (No Homo)"", and ""Whoo Hoo"" feels welcome. And then there's ""Hate My Job"". Killa's relationship with reality is so dysfunctional that his most ""normal"" songs tend to be his weirdest, especially when he tries to make an honest connection: the maybe-sincere love letter ""Daydreamin'"", ""I.B.S."" (that's irritable bowel syndrome). It's hard to say what could have inspired this unusually human and empathetic moment-- ""Ay yo, I hate my boss/ Dude think he know it all/ And I know I know it all/ But I follow protocol."" It's typical Cam smirk, and really the last bit of self-respect he can dredge up before a host of travails break him down, from everyday nuisances (""That's why I light the sour before I hit the office/ Being here eight hours sure get you nauseous"") to the very real hopelessness befalling someone with a checkered past (""You're working on my future/ Why you calling out my history?""). As bizarre as it initially seems for a rapper like Cam'ron to go in character as a working stiff, it's not unprecedented-- in fact, the soundtrack for Office Space had two such instances, from Canibus and Kool Keith. The latter's shadow paradoxically hangs heavy over Crime Pays-- shortly after Dr. Octagonecologyst broke him with the indie set*,* Keith was also making intermittently enjoyable records centered around NBA namedrops, poop jokes, and the fine distinction between ""alien"" and ""alienating."" It's a slippery slope Cam would be well-advised to study, since on four separate ""Fuck Cam"" skits, a bunch of crotchety haters talk shit about his lemonhead earrings, floor-length minks, and his pink and purple pioneering. In their minds, Cam's done nothing worth really mentioning since 2005, and Crime Pays often makes you wonder if they've got a point.","We wanted a The Wrestler-style comeback that derived power from its protagonist's fall; instead, this LP has a lonely, defensive Kirk Van Houten vibe.

Modern Silence,Casper & the Cookies,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a420c0084474cd0c0415/1:1/w_160/b1fd491a.jpg,2009-05-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13032-modern-silence/,Happy Happy Birthday to Me,"Some overlong records practically beg the listener to edit them down into a more manageable experience. For example, think of how most anyone that has ever owned a copy of the Magnetic Fields' 69 Love Songs has narrowed it down to a single disc of favorites, and how all of those customized mixes seem to differ from each other significantly. When albums include a large number of songs in a variety of styles, it's nearly inevitable that they seem uneven and test the patience of even the most generous fan. This is very much the case with Casper & the Cookies' third album, Modern Silence, which burns through 18 tracks in nearly 70 minutes, and invites serious listener fatigue despite the band's gift for writing songs with pleasant melodies and occasionally interesting textures. Modern Silence starts strong with a handful of assured, well-constructed pop songs that establish the band's eclecticism and set a high bar for the rest of the album. After kicking off with the breezy glam rocker ""Little King"" and the casually groovy ""You Love Me"", the group veers off in a less accessible but more intriguing direction with ""Pete Erchick Bicentennial Service Area"", a peculiar, twitchy number that nods to a dozen strains of post-punk before ending on an inexplicable electric piano outro that sounds rather like ""lite jazz"" hold music. This is the band at their best-- leaning hard on familiar styles and sounds, but tweaking them with unexpected tones and tangents. ""Sharp!"", the next cut, applies a similarly eccentric trajectory to a funky, hyperactive tune that recalls some of the songs on of Montreal's The Sunlandic Twins, but after its abrupt conclusion, the record immediately hits a wall with the clunky, treacly ballad ""Song Across The Sea"". This is an unfortunate bit of sequencing, not simply for the way it kills the album's momentum, but in that it signals the record's uneven nature a bit too soon. After this point, Modern Silence loses any sense of cohesion and begins to seem more like an arbitrarily sequenced playlist than an album. In the long middle phase of the record, the group offers diminishing returns on song forms already established in its first third. ""Moldy Flower"" is an amiable riff rocker, but lacks the easy charm of ""Little King"". ""Cloud of Bees"", though weirder and more melodically appealing than ""Song Across the Sea"", is no less of a mood-killer. The colorful, goofy jerkiness of ""Sharp!"" is echoed in ""Little Lady Larva"", but with the cloying wackiness of a second-rate children's song. This stretch is not a total drag, however. ""Meredith"", a track penned by songwriter Kay Stanton, comes off like a great lost 80s college-rock hit with a lead vocal falling somewhere between the deliveries of Barbara Manning and Kristen Hersh. Stanton also shines on the perky quasi-gospel number ""Sunshine Girl"". Given that the greatest flaw of Modern Silence is its overlong duration, it's something of a surprise that the 15-minute epic that ends the record ranks among its best selections. ""I Am Gone"", a trippy audio collage encompassing elements of psychedelia, jazz, electronic pop, and all manner of madcap silliness, features 35 musicians, but no members of Casper & the Cookies. The composition is wildly indulgent but consistently engaging, moving from idea to idea with an enthusiasm and imagination lacking in too many of the tracks that precede it. When the group is more straightforward, their mild-mannered demeanor and competent professionalism come as a detriment to the songs, which take on the hollow catchiness of a mediocre musical theater approximation of rock music. Casper & the Cookies simply have more to offer when they make bolder decisions and push their songs to aesthetic extremes. Luckily, there is nothing to stop a listener from editing the sprawl of Modern Silence down to just those moments of inspiration.","Sometimes-inspired guitar pop band gets long in the tooth on their sprawling new album.

Hey Everyone!,Dananananaykroyd,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d8b1335d7bf1698803/1:1/w_160/2e925f09.jpg,2009-05-14 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12964-hey-everyone/,Best Before,"The Denver Westword recently asked Los Campesinos! musical mastermind Tom Campesinos! whether it frustrates him to see reviews that describe his expansively punk-wracked Welsh septet's guitar-and-xylophone pop as ""twee."" He said it doesn't, explaining, ""One of the most important things about any sort of art is an element of humor, and not to take yourself too seriously."" Same goes for art appreciation, not that you'd know it most days from us stuffy critics. Let Marty McFly tell you: The future is heavy. U.S. producer Machine, probably best known for his work with metal musos Lamb of God, has been getting fine work out of bands that make melodic indie rock similar to LC!'s, only... less twee. First up was Birmingham, England's Johnny Foreigner, whose excellent 2008 Waited Up 'Til It Was Light had macho muscle to match its endearing boy-girl singalongs. Now Glaswegian sextet Dananananaykroyd, also under Machine's oversight, follow with another debut liable to unite moshers and librarians. The two aren't mutually exclusive, you know. On Hey Everyone!, Dananananaykroyd's chopsy dual-drummer approach goes for wrecking-ball guitar leads before fatal LiveJournal entries; your standard, spindly UK indie always meets with something heavier. On ""The Greater Than Symbol and the Dash"", guitarists Duncan Robertson and David Roy dive from piercing feedback to downers-dosed metal lurch; a pair of cascading drum fills make way for a throat-curdler from the singer (Calum Gunn and co-drummer John Baille Junior share lead duties), who sounds raw and bestial where his peers might come off shrill. ""1993"" is another scream, splitting time between hardcore thrash and contemplative instrumental passages that recall the 1990s emo likes of Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate. Throughout, Dananananaykroyd fuck with time signatures the way indie-famouser Glaswegians play with words. Um, then again, there's really no ignoring that ridiculous band name. Which I'm starting to think is as brilliant as I originally thought it was dumb-- another set of not-really-opposites. On the same song, Dananananaykroyd (thanks, Command-V! And thank you, Elwood Blues!) make a defiant mantra out of a decidedly twee-ass phrase: ""Turn your hissy fits into sissy hits."" Good advice, that, and it works multiple could-be-hit wonders. With its jagged surge and shouts of ""say it!"", ""Pink Sabbath"" is less Ozzy, more Mclusky. ""Black Wax"" makes room in its beautiful-and-stoned Pavement jangle for dramatic backing vocals and agonized yells; the galloping rhythms and rapidfire guitar hooks of first self-effacing ""Totally Bone"" and then Beatles-citing finale ""Song One Puzzle"" had me thinking Modest Mouse until they had me thinking, almost, Mastodon. Sissy hit: anti-pep-rally shoutalongs. For as awesome as Dananananaykroyd are at blasting the bejesus out of some of my favorite bands-- hey, they can even play their instruments!-- it's less clear what they're all about. Hey Everyone! doesn't wear its heart on its sleeve like sloppier Mclusky-ites Japandroids, doesn't reflect every nuance of its scene with the observational acuity of LC!, isn't Mclusky Do Dallas. But in its own combustive way, it's weirdly memorable. The track that initially drew me in, ""Infinity Milk"", uses ragged sprawl to set off call-and-response vocals about napalm. ""These are the days of our fucking lives,"" exults ""Hey James"". We used to dream; now we've learned to stop worrying and love the firebomb.","Glaswegian sextet Dananananaykroyd create a debut that, like Los Campesinos!, is liable to unite moshers and librarians.

Other folks listen for comfort music-- old sounds given a new sheen or a new industry push. These divisions aren't always obvious, as champions of all genres and members of every social group fall unevenly and unpredictably into (and between) those dual castes. You'll find respective purists in noise and adult-contemporary pop, and you'll find teenagers and their grandparents who pine for the good ol' days. Each is bound to have a more progressive counterpart somewhere on the other side of the fence. Don't be surprised, then, that one of the most ambitious and iconoclastic rock records of the year comes from three bearded, farm-living brothers raised in the rural hills between Washington, D.C., and Virginia's Shenandoah Mountains. Together as Pontiak, the Carneys-- Jennings, Lain, and Van-- turn Maker, their second album for Thrill Jockey, into a platform for bending elemental rock'n'roll into warped shapes. All the while, they keep the purists happy by putting the song at the center of the conquest. Pontiak self-released their second record, Sun on Sun, in 2007 in an edition of 500 LPs. Last year, Thrill Jockey grabbed the album for a wide reissue that went largely unnoticed. Makes sense: Sun on Sun remains a somewhat indefinable quantity that erects big, brash rock songs with three-part harmonies and clangorous playing amid extended instrumental interludes, outros, and intros. United only by a slight haze of mystery and a visceral first-take buzz, the brothers mined slight funk (""White Mice""), bar-band force (""Shell Skull""), roadhouse waltzes (""Tell Me About""), and dreamy gospel-rock (""Sun on Sun"") in nine weird numbers. The songs themselves were strong, but it's easy to see how the record-- blurring borders as it did-- could be written off as non-committal heavy rock. It was easy to imagine Pontiak trimming the fat for the follow-up, editing away the instrumental excess and focusing on rock songs that could land on blogs and college charts. That might happen yet: The Maker tracks with relatively traditional structures are outstanding pan-American rock songs, aggregating blues, soul, Southern rock, and alt-rock into tunes you can, you know, sing. Opener ""Laywayed"" introduces its layers one at a time-- a jagged guitar line, a simple drum march, big bass sustains-- before charging into two parallel verses built so well that they're as memorable as a refrain (which the song forgoes). Above grimy guitar and bass, the Carneys present ""Honey"" in three-piece vocal unison, turning what sounds like a work song on its head. Pontiak grind through a series of bucolic images with resolute lethargy, suggesting a springtime Sunday where chores are abandoned for play-- booze, instruments, naps. Overall, though, Maker is perhaps twice as divisive as its predecessor. With two more tracks and seven more minutes, it's increasingly eclectic and rangy. Still, it's more cohesive than Sun on Sun because its lopsided structure engenders a sense of propulsion. Each time a pattern begins to emerge, the Carneys destroy it: During ""Laywayed"", for instance, Pontiak ride a riff for the first 30 seconds. They pause, but instead of immediately ripping back into the song, they go silent for five seconds. The bait-and-switch commands attention. And there's the album's overall structure: The first, third, and fifth tracks are lumbering rock anthems worth humming. The subsequent even-numbered tracks-- two, four, and six-- are aggressive instrumental bursts, each lasting less than two minutes. After track seven's subdued sing-along, you'd expect a return to those two-minute offensives. Instead, Pontiak unveil their instrumental epic, the 14-minute title track that builds and collapses several times over its length. Mining Om's bass-and-cymbal throb, ""Maker"" wallows at a mid-tempo trot. Little melodies swirl, and the tune gradually builds to the eight-minute mark. Then the pot begins to boil. Pontiak roar, but they settle again, their careful tension and release drawing more attention to riffs and rhythms than catharsis. Even at 14 minutes, ""Maker"" develops, moves, and feels like a song, not a long edit of a jam or exercise. And that's the real charm of Maker. Even when Pontiak are demolishing, abbreviating, or stretching structures, they maintain an allegiance to song. ""Heat Pleasure"" might be 94 seconds of cymbal splatter and feedback rolling into one wide wave, but it adheres with direction and purpose. With its shifts in meter and simple key changes, the headlong burst ""Headless Conference"" is as memorable as ""Wild Knife Night Fight"", the catchy harmony-heavy bass tune that follows. Even the album's ragtag acoustic number sounds as subversive as the 14-minute trip in front of it. Pontiak, then, find ways to satisfy both castes-- the musical purists and progressives-- even as they play songs that seem designed for one or the other.","Three brothers in rural Virginia craft ambitious and iconoclastic music that incorporates Southern rock, soul, and avant-garde elements.

Intimacy Remixed,Bloc Party,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41313d1975652138c18/1:1/w_160/e67232ab.jpg,2009-05-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13020-intimacy-remixed/,Wichita,"Silent Alarm Remixed is one the best top-to-bottom remixes of a rock record ever put together, though that's damning praise at best. In retrospect, Silent Alarm was unusually well-positioned for this sort of treatment: Though energetic and brash and packed with ideas, the production was spacious enough to leave something to the imagination. And though seduced by dance music's textures and form, Bloc Party needed someone to take it there while they fretted about serious shit like gas prices and manifest destiny. It also didn't hurt that the original was a hell of a record to begin with. All this goes a long way towards explaining how Intimacy is the Bloc Party record most indebted to electronic composition and yet the worst suited for a full-length remix. In its original form, Intimacy already sounded like a remix of a rock record, overstuffed and pimped out exhibits of Paul Epworth and Jacknife Lee's studio trickery. The best and possibly only way to hear these songs differently would be to be strip them down to the chassis: Even if you were into ""Ares"" and ""Mercury"", did you think, ""Hey, you know what these songs could use? More block rockin' beats and star guitars!""? Kele Okereke's vocal performances on each were goofy enough to be hooky, but Intimacy Remixed starts out with two variations on the same blow-snorting bassline and candy raver thump that will remind you that as long as it's been since you listened to Justice'sÂ â , it's been even longer since you've seen Go. Truth is that for all the hoping-for-a-miracle stridency of Silent Alarm, Bloc Party have always been a band that's way more sappy than their reputation sometimes allows. But that could've been used to their advantage here, since many of the electronic acts that have crossed over to rockist ears have not only dealt in softer, more cerebral sounds, but also more minimal ones. I don't know if Air France could salvage ""Zephyrus"" or whether ""Mercury"" could be chopped and looped Field-style or if ""Halo"" could make for solid dubstep or if Intimacy could possibly go Balearic. But doesn't that already sound like a more interesting angle? ""Signs"" was basically *Intimacy'*s answer to ""So Here We Are"", very gorgeous on its own, but still leaving airspace to float upwards to-- I'd certainly like to hear what Four Tet could do with it, because even if Armand Van Helden's hyper-compressed swells are at least an original take, it still ruins the mood completely. ""Ion Square"" ended the original iTunes release of Intimacy on a note of gorgeous hope, while the Banjo or Freakout remix offers neither, and instead Okereke's vocal falls further and further down an aluminum well. It's hard to tell who's really at fault here, Bloc Party or their charges. But remix albums all but acknowledge their own inessentiality-- why not take more chances when only the diehards are going to subject themselves to 60 minutes of someone else's idea of what Intimacy could sound like? What if Mogwai showed up with more than just an extra flanger effect? And then No Age of all people show up to tinker with ""Better Than Heaven"", one of Intimacy's Side-B highlights. You might want to sit down for this, but after a smear of backmasked vocals, it soon becomes a hotly recorded mess of distorted drumming and feedback. Granted, that's old hat for No Age, but the idea of Bloc Party being inspired by their racket is the sort of ""who knew?"" surprise that a no-expectation affair like this should offer. And yet, even with Intimacy Remixed's almost non-existent replay value, it actually offers something of a sense of hope. I sometimes wonder if I was too tough on Intimacy, because even if the songs themselves failed, there was at least the indication that Bloc Party was still trying to offer something bigger than even their peers from 2003-2005; MaxÃ¯mo Park and Futureheads march sluggishly ever onward to anonymity, while Franz Ferdinand have become so competent that I have to remind myself they actually released a record just this year. I realize that there's plenty of bands that want to sound like ""Helicopter"", and Bloc Party is no longer one of them-- but Remixed proves that they might want to think different instead of simply thinking bigger.","In its original form,Â Intimacy already sounded like anÂ overstuffedÂ remix of a rock record, but here we go with another attempt at making it any good.

Wavering Radiant,Isis,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4065e6ef9596932078f/1:1/w_160/900835c4.jpg,2009-05-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13009-wavering-radiant/,Ipecac,"Pin a single label, style, adjective on Isis and it slips right off. They seem immune. For more than a decade, the Los Angeles five-piece has maneuvered between cries and whispers, dirt and polish, bruising noise and narcotic subtlety, repeatedly redrawing the borders of the one genre that accommodates them, metal, as they annex more sonic territory beyond it. This means trading metal's usual symphony of downtuned riffs for a broader set of digressions and moods: On new albumÂ Wavering Radiant, these self-professed Fennesz and Pink Floyd devotees have turned often-drab contemporary guitar rock into music flush with fresh emotions and ideas-- a triumph that owes to the casual restraint of Joe Barresi's production. Moving away from the analytic approach favored by longtime Isis producer Matt Bayles, collecting the entire band in one place, and writing without a deadline has lentÂ Radiant a sense of completeness and unity that recalls album-rock's golden years. Wavering Radiant continues the shifts made onÂ 2006'sÂ In the Absence of Truth-- namely, more elaborate sonics and increased rhythmic variety-- while also emphasizing the finer points of tempo and, especially, melody. Melodicism not only adds a new dimension to Isis' music but another way to raise the tension, by silhouetting those melodies against their slabs of dissonance. As singer Aaron Turner told MTV, the potent, parallel forms of their past work-- one instrument tailing the other-- gave way in Absence to a flowing conversation of instruments. The effect there, and more so here, is a veto on thickness for the sake of thickness: The mix instead is stacked with accents and pairings that surprise and complement one another rather than feel redundant. Equally vital to the record's dense, hypnotic shape is Clifford Meyer's command of the keyboard. Lingering organ lines seep into the pores and cracks of each track, leaving tiers of texture that brighten up the dark spots. For the most part, Meyer is more active than that though: His blissful, knotty phrases, played on a dusty Hammond B3 or Rhodes, often recreate moments from the psychedelic and prog-rock past. Along the same lines, the title track and the effects-laden finale ""Threshold of Transformation"" capture this feeling of retro reverie. Whether it is this brand of low-key ambience or the rhythm section's siege attack, these songs are spread across the entire dynamic range, starting with an enveloping, ruthlessly direct low end. That solidity comes at the start: ""Hall of the Dead"" may be the lushest, most astutely crafted opener in the Isis discography. Fans of their earlier work will welcome the jerky first riff, but soon the grind of Celestial (2001) or the Mosquito Control EP (1998) fades away, leaving the track bobbing in sludge. Harris doesn't take it lying down, drawingÂ menace and beauty in equal parts from his kit. TurnerÂ works similar wonders-- his clearer-than-ever voice stands out at times over the murky compositions while blending into the loud, surrounding dark at others. Not that you can understand everything he says. On the first track, the pattern of bellows and roars calls to mind Nancy and Lee's ""Some Velvet Morning"", except Turner makes it a one-man duet. The brawny thump of ""Stone to Wake a Serpent"" has him belting in both his clean and hoarse styles, too, and though the words are unintelligible, the multiple personalities of his voice nicely mirror the guitar's many incarnations on that track-- crunchy explosions of fuzz, depressed twangs, banshee shrieks. Track for track, Wavering Radiant is the smartest and richest record in Isis' catalog: Here they manage not just to build on, but also to inventively weld together, their past work into one interlocking whole. Naysayers who cast off In the Absence of Truth as too subdued ought to don their headphones again: There was a sense of fastidious craft and atmosphere that may take repeated spins to sink in. And the same goes for the far superior Wavering Radiant. Easily the band's most accessible effort, hipsters and headbangers will likely agree it's also their most intricately imagined. To luxuriate in the details, to fully receive the melodies and tones and the bewildering interplay of every element, Isis demand not merely active, not athletic, but something like Olympic listening.","L.A.'s Isis have a way of transforming contemporary guitar rock into music flush with fresh emotions and ideas, and this is their smartest and richest record.

Wooden Arms,Patrick Watson,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41aea9e61561daa4e10/1:1/w_160/ba1f1517.jpg,2009-05-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13027-wooden-arms/,Secret City,"Back in 2007, the easy literary comparison for me to make with Patrick Watson's out-of-nowhere Polaris-pinchingÂ Close to Paradise wasÂ Peter Pan. Like the ship in a jar that decorates the album cover,Â Paradise was a fantastical world in miniature, intricately detailed and designed to evoke imaginative flights of fancy. It was alsoÂ too ethereal: all flying and no destination. A year and a half later, Watson is back with his third album,Â Wooden Arms, and not much has changed. He's still waiting to sweep us from our bedroom windows and show us a wonderful world that exists in the realm of the fantastic, his voice is still cartoonishly woozy and antique-sounding (part Jeff Buckley, but also M. Ward and Devendra Banhart), and his music still sounds like an ultra-busy score for a highbrow children's book or a whimsical silent film. And the same vexing problem keeps arising: When the band isn't making music that operates under a frustrating dream logic, they're, well, lulling me to sleep. Wooden even features aÂ song calledÂ ""Where the Wild Things Are"", which should surprise no one. Watson, still inextricable from the liminal state between dreaming and waking life, wrote the piece as an homage to his favorite book as a child, with the knowledge that Spike Jonze was adapting the book for an upcoming film. The song's light, apprehensive piano and foreboding pizzicato strings do have the feel of a score (Watson actually sent it to Jonze on a lark). Too bad it's meant to stand on its own onÂ Wooden, because it doesn't do much without a proper cinematic referent. Watson's simplistic, light-headed incantations--Â ""I go to where the wild things are""--Â aren't exactly transfixing, and the arrangement as a whole bogs down in pre-bedtime sleepiness on its way to dreamland. Elsewhere,Â Wooden marks an ever-so-slight shift in approach. Specifically, the album's classicist leanings are cut with a moreÂ ""organic""Â vibe, which too often emerges sounding like a group of classically-trained buskers than what they seemed to be aiming toward: Elvis Perkins, or maybe Grizzly Bear. ""Beijing""Â promises to deliverÂ ""the sound of the city""Â (or so Watson's hazy refrain would have us believe), but the song's lasting image is its percussion, a hyperactive hodgepodge of clanking metals that does no favors to the competing mellow tone of the piece. The same goes for the preceding numberÂ ""Tracy's Waters"",Â which buries a simple melody under layers of floor toms, tinkling doodads, and sappy strings. ""Down at the Beach""Â is downright frustrating in its lack of structure or motivation, moving from nervous strings to a wholly unearned post-rock style mid-song crescendo, and ending with a brooding piano atop more far-off clickety-clack. I've no idea how the band creates its music, but I have the suspicion that if I hired Patrick Watson (again, the name of the collectiveÂ and its leader) to build my home, I would expect to get the dining room wallpaper and front-porch trimwork plans first. Patrick Watson doesn't do foundation work exceedingly well. Yet this is not to say that there aren't moments onÂ Wooden that suggest songcraft was the foremost urge. The title track is a sweet little lullaby (something that, despite his faults as a songwriter, Watson does pretty well) crafted mainly from a standup bassline and piano, with even the extraneous noises glossing as little pitter-pats.Â ""Big Bird in a Small Cage""Â starts as another anxious piano piece, but detours after the first verse into a country duet, featuring Katie Moore, whose high quaver suggests a young Dolly Parton.Â ""Big Bird""Â does have its unnecessary additions-- do we really need all those Beach Boys-ishÂ ""ba ba ba""s?-- but at least it works from a somewhat solid melodic structure, so that breaks from it are always referencing something firm. On an album comprised of so many left turns, it's one of the few unexpected moments that registers as aÂ welcome surprise.","Polaris Prize winner offers an album of left turns, the album's classicist leanings cut with a more organic vibe.

When I See the Sun Always Shines on TV,Nadja,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41813d1975652138c27/1:1/w_160/c02bc79a.jpg,2009-05-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13026-when-i-see-the-sun-always-shines-on-tv/,The End,"You probably assumed there was no earthly way that ""Only Shallow"", the opening track on My Bloody Valentine's immortalÂ Loveless, could possibly get any heavier or more monolithic. And there, apparently, you would have been wrong: the Toronto metal-gaze duo Nadja proves it on the first seconds of their audacious and spectacular new covers recordÂ When I See the Sun Always Shines On TV. Their version slows the tempo so drastically that the song feels like it might derail; listening to it feels like watching a drunk friend stagger to their front door and praying they don't trip on their dragging feet. The guitar fuzz is wince-inducingly harsh, as if Aidan Baker gave his amp the Dave Davies treatment: i.e., two slashes straight right through the head. The vocals, while still buried, emanate low and warped from the bottom of the mix instead of floating weightlessly above it. If you could chop and screw a shoegaze record (screw-gaze?) it might sound like this, and Nadja's roaring wind-tunnel version manages to render MBV's original airy and harmless by comparison, as blasphemous as that might sound. For an ambient metal act,Â Loveless is basically Everest, and for Nadja to tackle one of its signature songs and flawlessly stick the landing for theÂ opening track of their record gives just a hint ofÂ When I See the Sun's ambition and reach. Of all the droning metal-gaze groups-- Isis, CaÃ¯na, Katatonia-- Nadja have the best grasp on massive distortion's ability to alternately bludgeon and soothe, and the overwhelming wall of body-vibrating noise they summon on record is a profoundly physical, even sensual experience. When you produce a sound this enormous, it begins to live a life apart from you, and Nadja have spent their career taming and harnessing the beast they have created. Their previous records were mostly exercises in sound worship, the sort of amniotic sound tanks you immerse yourself in with a pair of boutique headphones when you want your mind obliterated. But on When I See the Sun, they seem to want to prove they also recognize great songwriting, and it turns out they not only have impeccable taste, they also have an instinctive understanding of the type of songs that tend to increase in mystery and intimacy when swaddled in an impenetrable fog of guitars. Some of their choices are intuitive, even obvious-- the cover of ""Pea"", for instance, from Codeine's 1990 slowcore classicÂ Frigid Stars, feels even more numbed and despondent than the original, which was one of the more emotionally naked, vulnerable moments on the album. Swans' ""No Cure For the Lonely"", from 1992'sÂ Love of Life, is another logical selection, and Nadja hit every step in the song's endlessly descending chord progression with a bleary thud. Their rendition of the Cure's ""Faith"", meanwhile, is one of the only moments where their reach slightly exceeds their grasp; Baker's murmuring, chant-beneath-the-waves vocals don't quite fit a song that laid so much at the feet of its miraculous vocal performance. It's impossible to hear the contours of the song's melody being traced and not immediately yearn for Robert Smith's pure, keening tenor. The album's most revelatory moment, in the end, results from one of the most left-field choices: the astonishing cover of Elliott Smith's ""Needle in the Hay"". Baker and Leah Buckareff's battering ram of noise transforms the original's crystalline fragility into one long, slow, sickening dive downward. Baker's already buried vocals are abstracted to a ghostly, disembodied wisp, which perfectly suits the under-the-breath quality of Smith's angry mantras. Lester Bangs often observed that heavy metal's womblike bass frequencies provided handy sanctuary for the numbed and depressed;Â Nadja must have recognized in Smith someone who would welcome the comfort that an immersion in pure noise could bring.","Toronto metal-gaze duo doesn't shrink from a challenge on this covers LP, taking on MBV, Elliott Smith, Swans, the Cure, and more.

Black Square,DD/MM/YYYY,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40fea9e61561daa4dfb/1:1/w_160/33438ac6.jpg,2009-05-13 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13017-black-square/,ImposeWe Are Busy Bodies,"Just as there are many different ways to pronounce or butcher this group's somewhat awkward name, there are many different ways to view DD/MM/YYYY on their latest album, Black Square. If you start from the front of the record, then Marc Masters' description of their sound (in his write-up of the album's excellent lead-off track, ""Bronzage"") is the way to go-- ""think hyper math-punk with touches of prog and hardcore."" If you're listening to this on shuffle, and you happen to land on ""Birdtown"", you might think you've stumbled across an uninspired horn-loving synth-heavy instrumental combo. If the wild oscillations and rumbling hiss of ""Lismer"" tumble from your earbuds, you'll think these guys are spastic obnoxious noiseniks. The NES mating calls in ""I'm Still in the Wall"" (along with an earlier album's title-- Blue Screen of Death) might have you believe DD/MM/YYYY are card-carrying members of Bitpop Nation. In other words, Black Square covers a fair amount of territory over the course of 35 minutes. For better or worse,Â DD/MM/YYYYÂ don't stay in one place for long, and they certainly don't keep still. As the bookends of this album ably display-- ""Bronzage"" at the start, ""Digital Haircuit"" at the end-- DD/MM/YYYY can rein in their stylistic happy feet long enough to bang out infectious and spry post-punky tunes. Most of the album features a fair number of similar songs that effectively encompass DD/MM/YYYY's disparate musical interests without seeming fussy or overwrought. Unfortunately, they try to mimic their stop-start rhythmic agility with the album's various stylistic shifts. It's not so much that the changes of pace are unwelcome, but it's the way these changes are implemented that causes problems. The whip-smart call-and-response action in ""No Life""-- think Fugazi with pocket-protectors-- is abruptly cut off at the two-minute mark, careening listeners headfirst into the queasy shimmering torpor of ""'They'"" and a potential case of whiplash. Detours like ""My Glasses""-- a minute-long track of someone running their finger along the edge of vinegar-rimmed drinking glasses-- or the aforementioned ""Birdtown"" wouldn't be so bad if they weren't put back-to-back right in the middle of the album. These bait-and-switch tactics do a lot to stall the album's momentum. In the case of the brake-slamming tempo change in ""Real Eyes"", it can gum up the works mid-song. And then there's an arcade-game-sampling instrumental to contend with before Black Square gets back to doing what it did back at the start. For folks willing to roll with the punches, or fans of the Mae Shi and friends looking for more of the same type of hyper-hopscotch, Black Square will be a highly enjoyable front-to-back listen. But for folks expecting more versions of what its first few tunes promise, the sardonic words of advice offered in the intro to ""$50,000 Guitar Head"" suffice as a fair warning: ""Good luck-- you'll need it!""","The band name is getting these guys attention, but their hyphenate-heavy take on math-rock, hardcore, and electronic noise is also head-turning.

DÃ©livrance,A Hawk and a Hacksaw,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f95e6ef9596932076f/1:1/w_160/b9f5cc3a.jpg,2009-05-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12997-delivrance/,Leaf,"The story of A Hawk and a Hacksaw is as captivating and multifarious as the duo's growing body of work. Having started out as the solo project of former Neutral Milk Hotel drummer and multi-instrumentalist Jeremy Barnes, AHAAH's extraordinarily beautiful self-titled debut album was recorded in the French countryside and released in 2002. Later travels in the Czech Republic inspired another recording before Barnes returned to his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he met his paramour and collaborator, the highly talented violinist Heather Trost. A likeminded passion for music and adventure led the couple to spend extended periods of time in Hungry and Romania as they forged deep bonds with local musicians, capturing the magic of their interaction on an EP, 2007's A Hawk and A Hacksaw and the Hun HangÃ¡r Ensemble. A Hawk and a Hacksaw's music has always been heavily inspired by the folk traditions of Eastern Europe, and their determination to integrate themselves into that region's culture and contemporary music scene has enabled them to continuously create absorbing and exciting songs. Since the duo are actively learning about the music they love from the artists who know it best, AHAAH's compositions always sound like they're moving forward and flourishing-- whereas a less musically courageous group could end up being a one trick pony. Their fourth album, DÃ©livrance, is centered around Barnes' masterful tackling of percussion and accordion, Trost on violin, and a gaggle of Hungarian specialists such as the trumpeter Ferenc KovÃ¡cs and one of the world's foremost cimbalom virtuosos, KÃ¡lmÃ¡n Balogh, who bring their animated musical personalities into the frame. On past albums, AHAAH's klezmer and folk motifs have been anchored by a certain sorrow that was evident amid the exuberance, enticing the listener to experience a varied emotional flow. DÃ©livrance is no less potent for being as effervescently high-spirited as it is. Even the lackadaisical drama of ""Vasalisa Carries a Flaming Skull Through the Forest"" feels drunkenly merry, like a casual, winding stroll through the trees after a night carousing on the cobblestones. If AHAAH were to have a ""party"" album, this would be it. Tracks such as ""The Man Who Sold His Beard"" and ""Zibiciu"" are foot-stomping reveries that sound as though they were composed in a smoky, crowded cafÃ© on the banks of the Danube. So it's not surprising to hear that the band often kick started their improvisations with a shot of pÃ¡linka, a type of Hungarian fruit brandy. As the group continues to draw inspiration from their travels and friends, they challenge themselves with baffling rhythmic tricks and collaborative ideas that fuse traditional melodies with their own distinguishing attributes. The gloriously sprightly energy of DÃ©livrance is so ebullient and full of character that by the time it's over you feel like you've caught a glimpse of the type of joyful festivity that always feels most rewarding after a long journey.","As-ever inspired by the folk traditions of Eastern Europe, here Jeremy Barnes' outfit reaches a new level of exuberance.

Quicken the Heart,Maximo Park,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a405ea9e61561daa4de5/1:1/w_160/04a98b44.jpg,2009-05-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13007-quicken-the-heart/,Warp,"Despite the rating above, MaxÃ¯mo Park haven't quite followed the same tragic three-album arc as fellow UK post-punk revivalists like Bloc Party or Futureheads. Sure, their creative zest has also buckled under the pressure of success and pristine production, but of all the ""angular"" sediment the Franz Ferdinand tidal wave brought with it, the always underratedÂ MaxÃ¯mo ParkÂ felt most like a diamond in the rough. DebutÂ A Certain Trigger still staves off easy pigeonholing, its influences obvious but execution nuanced. Also, for a thorough album that didn't need to rely on singles, it gave us fist-pumpers like ""Apply Some Pressure"" and ""Graffiti"", instantly classic guitar-rock songs at a time when the previously redundant phrase ""guitar rock"" became a niche modifier. Yes, the other revivalists had big hits and nifty debut albums, too, butÂ MaxÃ¯moÂ Park felt unique, more wide-eyed and versatile and, most importantly, not too tightly tethered to any one trend. So why are MaxÃ¯mo Park milling around the same mid-career cul-de-sac as their cohorts? For starters, they over-reached to prove their songwriting chops on 2007's coercively grown-upÂ Our Earthly Pleasures. Like Keanu Reeves on that bus, the band's hooks are doomed when traveling at less-than-frenetic speeds, andÂ Pleasures was too concerned with deliberately collating all the emotions and anxieties that sounded better strewn about on the debut. Not-so-secret weapon Paul Smith, a throwback to show-stealing Brit frontmen like Morrissey and Jarvis Cocker, felt wasted on that album, relegated to ham-fisted attempts at conventional balladry and Beatles-esque melodies instead of his signature half-ranted, half-sung vocals. Quicken the Heart's title is telling. The band seems to know their need to jumpstart the schmaltz fromÂ Pleasures and recapture the dilettantish energy that madeÂ Trigger so likable and unintentionally chic. Easier said than done, though. With Nick Launay behind the boards, the album feels like a geeky brother to It's Blitz!, also produced by Launay. The pairing bears fruit on ""The Kids Are Sick Again"", a mid-tempo single that begins with the same warm electro-rock buzz of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Zero"" or ""Soft Shock"" then escalates to a chorus worthy of Pulp during their peak. However, most of the synth lines here sound like they've wondered onto tracks they have no place occupying. The sluggish guitar rock on ""In Another World (You Would've Found Yourself by Now)"" and ""Calm"" needs more raw space and jagged guitar parts, not a coating of cold synthesizers to undermine Smith's heart-on-sleeve immediacy. Unlike Norton's adult-contemporary treatment onÂ Pleasures, though, Launay helps the album more than he hurts it. The fact is, these are the weakest batch of songs MaxÃ¯mo Park's brought into the studio to date. On attempted throwbacks like ""The Penultimate Clinch"", Smith and his bandmates struggle to regain their charisma, the song's limp kraut groove not helped by bathos like ""...But it's like dismantling/ A decommissioned spacecraft/ Some parts you can't destroy."" Even when showing their cards on ""Let's Get Clinical"" and ""Tanned"", two jerky math jams humbly cribbed from Wire'sÂ 154, the result feels tackier than it does sophisticated. Pleasures at least hit the soft targets it set out to. Here, the band's grasping at a sense of cool they used to stumble upon almost by accident. By the gooey last few tracks ofÂ Quicken, it seems they've quit the search for a fountain of youth, not even leaving a kernel of hope likeÂ Pleasures closer ""Parisian Skies"", which hinted atÂ MaxÃ¯moÂ Park becoming a 21st century version of R.E.M. Still, this album isn't a death knell for these once beloved upstarts. Smith is still persistently moral and compassionate, trying to preserve his heart (and sanity) in a fast-paced world of hi-tech gadgets and long-distance relationships. And perhaps part of the problem is thatÂ MaxÃ¯moÂ Park's hearts are too big. The painstaking introspection here seems to stem from a need to use their success and exposure to deliver some definitive, U2-sized message when really they're so much more relatable when they're awkwardly sorting out their psychological messes on the fly.","As the title implies, MaxÃ¯mo Park have realized they're better with rapid tempos than with conventional balladry and melodicism.

Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!,Chain and the Gang,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4155e6ef959693207b9/1:1/w_160/d1950554.jpg,2009-05-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13022-down-with-liberty-up-with-chains/,K,"Ian Svenonius has been working his ironic-not-ironic far-left rock'n'roll intellectual persona for more than 20 years now, and at this point, it is very hard to imagine that he ever breaks character. Whether he is fronting one of his many bands, penning provocative essays, or interviewing other musicians on his internet talk show, Svenonius is fully committed to a distinct personal aesthetic that he developed as the singer of the Nation of Ulysses that essentially boils down to a stylistic and philosophical marriage of groovy 1960s radicalism and late-80s indie-punk ethos. It's an affectation for sure, but even at his silliest extremes, it is abundantly clear that Svenonius fully believes in his rhetoric, and that it's not just some elaborate joke at the expense of old-school hipster intelligentsia. If anything, it has become clear that his performance is inherently confrontational in the way it forces cynical, complacent audiences to reckon with idealistic discontent and unapologetic goofiness, and nudges them to wonder how and why it became so uncool to mix pleasure and politics. Chain and the Gang, Svenonius' latest band, does not stray far from the sound of his previous work, though it does mostly jettison the hard psychedelic style of his Weird War project. As the name of the group implies, he has integrated some elements of prison blues, but the funky playfulness of the music mostly recalls his late-90s material as the frontman of the Make-Up. This is a welcome return to form-- though Weird War had a number of great songs, too many of their recordings felt stuffy and overbearing, and Svenonius' slinky, highly expressive voice is flattered by compositions with ample negative space. The grooves on Down With Liberty... Up With Chains! are about as loose as a band can get without being remotely sloppy, and the result is an album that emphasizes a sense of levity that has always been present in his work, but had never been quite as dominant as in this set of songs. Though Svenonius takes on some heavy topics throughout the record-- at one point, he's calling out for reparations!-- the politics of Chain and the Gang are primarily focused on matters of lifestyle and personal conduct. This is most evident on ""Trash Talk"", a rant against the omnipresence of snarkiness that owes more to the humanity and humor of Sly and the Family Stone than the clueless prissiness of anti-snark critic David Denby. It also comes through in the cheerful party rocker ""Room 19"", and in ""Unpronounceable Name"", a swinging, jazzy delight in which Svenonius plays the role of a romantic lead in pursuit of a woman with a name so difficult to say that she becomes entirely elusive and nearly mythical. Not all of the songs are gems-- the relatively dirge-like ""Deathbed Confession"" overstays its welcome by a few minutes, and the deliberately primitive ""(Lookin' For a) Cavegirl"" is rather tedious even before its first minute is through-- but otherwise the quality control is rather high, and the result may be Svenonius' best overall LP since the Make-Up's Save Yourself was released a decade ago.","New project from Ian Svenonius (Nation of Ulysses, Weird War) recalls his late-90s material with the Make-Up and is the best thing he's done since.

Desire Lines,Meanderthals,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f813d1975652138bdb/1:1/w_160/c4657231.jpg,2009-05-12 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12996-desire-lines/,Smalltown Supersound,"If you're wondering how the improbable pun ""meanderthal"" has entered the insular music lexicon twice in two years-- first as the title of Miami metalheads Torche's 2008 sophomore album and now as the moniker of the downtempo trio composed of the Idjut Boys and Rune Lindbaek-- look to academia. Matthew Tiessen of the University of Alberta, bless him, has defined the meanderthal as an urban monkeywrench, an inhibitor of the flow of modern life. Meanderthals (the group), presumably not buying what Tiessen's selling, have rebranded this persona as a loveable, harmless drifter, which aligns them philosophically with every jam band ever and possibly Asher Roth. Fitting, I suppose, as the group's debut album, Desire Lines (the title taken from one of Tiessen's papers), does a righteous job of staying out of pretty much everyone's way. Released on Smalltown Supersound, the two-bit takeaway for Desire Lines is that it blends the peculiar lounging of Balearic disco with folk/guitar music, peppering their downbeat grooves with wide-screen acoustic chording and gnarled psychedelics. A purely instrumental affair, Desire Lines feels roomy and unfussy despite the genre mashing, often laying in the cut of a ponderous and swollen bassline, upon which various niceties are poured. The low-end is so prominent and wandering that it sounds like the product of an old master's thumb, not a sequencer (indeed: Malcolm Joseph, bassist for Grace Jones, is credited on the album). The bass proves an equal foil for the widescreen, hippie-fried guitars of opener ""Kunst or Ars"", a track so relentlessly sunny in its folktronic blend that it makes Four Tet's Rounds sound like Burial's Untrue. Steel drums pepper the breaks, augmenting the humid scenery. Indeed, ""Kunst or Ars"" is Desire Lines' most enduring moment, though for a band that doesn't shy away from the Balearic disco tag, Meanderthals frequently dip their toes into swampier waters. ""Lasaron Highway"" recalls Ash Ra Tempel in both scope and oddity, noodling its way through nearly eight minutes of highway clang. Set closer ""Bugges Room"" re-imagines lounge jazz as a sleepy-eyed, coughing malcontent. There's beatmaking, too: The rummy, deep percussion that begins ""Andromeda (Prelude to the Future)"" might've been the start to a wall-shaking banger, but Meanderthals knead it into an un-casual, leering space-disco, the type of song you could dance to only passively at 5 a.m. ""Disco"" is probably the operative starting point for most of Desire Lines, but tracks often lack the linearity and repetition that base implies. ""Collective Fetish"" splashes guitars against its walls, quiets to an ominous burble, then fades to a gentle patter. The title track pans clean chords through each channel before building to a classic-rock climax, complete with careening guitars whose effects all sound programmed by a 17-year-old with too many pedals, but in a neat way. Barring the occasional mid-song bridge that might have you checking your watch, most of it works, too: Even when Desire Lines slows, it's because it's wandering or straggling, not because it's hamming out same-y minutes in some ill-forged notion of filling up a 12"" (like a real disco band). This is probably a product of all that layering, sure, but also the aforementioned worldview; however silly, Meanderthals believe all that hokey shit. Sometime when you're not real busy, give it a shot.","Debut album from London/Oslo trio on the Smalltown Supersound label blends the peculiar lounging of Balearic disco with folky acoustic touches.

Blood From a Stone,Hanne Hukkelberg,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a416b1335d7bf1698894/1:1/w_160/125f2e48.jpg,2009-05-12 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13023-blood-from-a-stone/,Nettwerk,"The thought first occurred to me on an escalator rising out of a D.C. Metro station: Norwegian musician Hanne Hukkelberg's arrangements are so dense and unusual they suck in sound. Listening to the title track of her third full-length, Blood from a Stone, I assumed the off-tempo clacks and the loud blasts of distortion I was hearing were all part of the music, the gradual ascension of the escalator heightening the song's steady crescendo. In fact, these elements were part of the machinery; that clatter was the grinding of escalator gears, and I'd heard that whale-song groaning of the belts every day for years. In addition to being a good reminder to get away from my computer more often, the experience suggested to me a mutability in Hukkelberg's music, which can change dramatically depending on your surroundings. To some extent, all music is like this, but her tightly orchestrated pop can be so intricate that it becomes interactive. That sensation is further heightened by her use of found instruments. Blood From a Stone, like its two predecessors, uses everything and the kitchen sink: bicycle spokes, typewriters, train doors, and flagpoles. Instead of drum kits, Hukkelberg and her backing musicians fashion percussion instruments from old refrigerators, ovens, and other discarded appliances. This isn't Stomp, though. Crucially, she makes no big show of such unusual instrumentation, which is most notable on songs like the standout ""In Here/Out There"" and the slowly intensifying ""Crack"", when the makeshift instruments mingle with the bass and guitar to create a strange rhythm section. In general, these are subtle, subdued, and occasionally stiff arrangements, which are as self-possessed as Sufjan's or Danielson's, but typically not as ostentatious. Hukkelberg would rather let all those unfamiliar sounds affect her songs subliminally, which means Blood From a Stone sometimes sounds muted and detached. In fact, guitar seems to be the prominent instrument on most of these songs: Bent notes fly around the chorus of the title track like sparks from a campfire, heightening the perverseness of the romantic situation she describes in the lyrics, and an agile electric guitar line gives ""Bandy Riddles"" its insistent, almost desperate pace. Not quite as loose as her two previous albums*, Blood from a Stone* is much more refined and sophisticated in creating such a curious and imaginatively ambient backdrop for her vocals and lyrics. In fact, this is a singer's album, highlighting Hukkelberg's voice above all else. Sounding at once venomously expressive yet somewhat distant, she goes for heavy-metal drama on ""Salt of the Earth"", contrasting a thunderous chorus with quieter verses. Yet Hukkelberg sounds jazzily spry on the title track and surprisingly glam on ""In Here/Out There"". Closer ""Bigd Til By"" (the only song written in her native Norwegian) shows off her nearly prismatic tone, evocatively accompanied by flagpole, oven, and whatever happens to be in earshot.","With found instruments and dense sounds, this Norwegian musician's tightly orchestrated pop can be so intricate that it becomes interactive.

Townes,Steve Earle,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fe5e6ef95969320778/1:1/w_160/81d52983.jpg,2009-05-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13001-townes/,New West,"Steve Earle first met Townes Van Zandt in Houston in the early 1970s, when the former was just a teenager and the latter had a couple of well-made, if not especially strong-selling, Â albums full of dusty melodies, desperate blues riffs, and heartbreaking metaphors. Teacher and student moved (separately) to Nashville, where they attended guitar pulls with the likes of Guy Clark and Steve Young. With his bone-deep intuition of country's potential for clearly and unpretentiously expressing emotional pain, Van Zandt, who died in 1997, taught Earle well, and you can hear the elder's influences in later compositions songs ""Goodbye"", ""Mercenary Song"", and ""Everyone's in Love with You"". In turn, Earle has lionized Van Zandt, naming him a patron saint of barrooms and benders and even naming his first-born Justin Townes. So a full album of Van Zandt covers was inevitable-- the culmination of Earle's three-and-a-half-decade admiration. In fact, it's surprising that Townes, as the album is titled, didn't arrive sooner. The concept may be genuine, but the timing seems calculated: For most of the Bush administration, Earle's career has been in a doldrums, and his last album, Washington Square Serenade, was quite possibly his worst. What should have been his ace, however, is not even a face card. Townes might have been inevitable, but it didn't have to be so dull. Earle keeps things fairly simple, performing stripped-down arrangements with a small group of musicians who function less as a backing band and more as a bunch of friends drinking beer on the front porch. For the most part, it's just Earle alone with these songs, his gravel voice matched to Van Zandt's well-worn lyrics. This approach works well enough on ""Pancho and Lefty"", which here becomes a headhung lament and thankfully lacks the synths of Willie and Merle's duet. Likewise, ""Colorado Girl"" and ""Marie"" re-create the casual intimacy of a late-night guitar pull. These are, along with melancholy closer ""To Live Is to Fly"" and the bluegrass-stained ""White Freight Liner Blues"", the album's brightest spots, as if Earle were emphasizing sentiment and performative spontaneity over all else. But what's lively on some songs is deadly on others. Earle plugs in for the bluesy ""Brand New Companion,"" although it drags ass so much you wish he'd unplug again. ""Delta Momma Blues"" picks up where ""White Freightliner Blues"" leaves off, but either the song just doesn't support the playing or this take was not especially inspired. And can someone please steal Earle's drum machine and distorto harmonica? There's something vulgar about the way they sound on this rough treatment of ""Lungs"", which features Tom Morello. This version trades mordant humor (""Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?"") for apocalyptic doomsaying and turns the original's modest blues rhythm into a cartoonish ""When the Man Comes Around"". Earle is certainly allowed to manhandle these not-quite-canonical songs, but in the rough and obvious way he mistreats them, he leaves little room for subtlety, restraint, or even taste. As gifted as Van Zandt was, Earle has him on range. Throughout his career, he has played hardy rock, straightforward country, growling blues, rambling bluegrass, and tender folk, and he has played with the Pogues, the Blind Boys of Alabama, the Del McCoury Band, Iris DeMent, and too many others to name. He's even published a collection of short stories and is working on a novel. Too bad Townes isn't as varied. There are nods toward certain styles and genres, but they come from the originals more often than from Earle himself, which makes the album sound overall a little too timid. If you're curious about Van Zandt-- and damn, you should be-- Fat Possum reissued several out-of-print albums in 2007, and pretty much any of those is a good place to start. If you're more interested in Earle, give a listen to Guitar Town or Train A Comin' or anything more than 10 years old. And if you're interested in the two of them together, track down the recently reissued Heartworn Highways collection, which features live guitar-pull performances from the 1970s. By comparison, Townes, though well intended, shows neither of these formidable artists in his best light.","The culmination of a three-and-a-half-decade admiration, Steve Earle's latest is a Townes Van Zandt cover album.

Lost Verses Live,Mark Kozelek,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40c13d1975652138c06/1:1/w_160/701e1ddc.jpg,2009-05-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13015-lost-verses-live/,Caldo Verde,"Almost every record Mark Kozelek has ever released, with his bands Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon and under his own name, has a monochromatic album cover. Black & white, sepia, a hint of red or blue-- the visual aesthetic of his records has been remarkably consistent. The easy joke here is that it's only been as consistent as the tone of his music-- slow and melancholy, with almost no exceptions-- but for a guy who really only has one speed, Kozelek has a very rewarding (and very deep) discography. Lost Verses Live is a long album gathering recordings from shows played in Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and San Francisco, alone with his guitar, and sometimes joined by second acoustic guitarist (and former Red House Painter) Phil Carney. It's very similar in feel to last year's comparably sparse live mini-album 7 Songs Belfast, and its basic sonic uniformity and beauty means it plays almost like an ambient recording. You can put it on in the background as well as any Eno meditation, but as with any great ambient music it also holds up to closer listening. Dictionary.com could save some time by simply uploading a sample of Kozelek singing to serve as its definition for melancholy, and his milky baritone rings out with intense clarity on these recordings, which were made in resonant rooms, from churches to theaters. Devoted fans will be richly rewarded for picking this up, though some newcomers might find their ears wandering as it stretches past the hour mark. I was split on whether I wanted the ""Lucky Man"" in the tracklisting to be a version of his own song by that name or an Emerson, Lake & Palmer cover, but having heard the crystalline reading of his own song, I'm glad it wasn't yet another novel cover from a guy who loves to give the solo acoustic treatment to KISS, AC/DC, and Modest Mouse. Modest Mouse's ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" does get the plaintive, quiet treatment here, one of two covers along with Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", which Kozelek makes about as heartbreaking as possible. He turns in a haunting, spare version of Sun Kil Moon's ""Salvador Sanchez"", a song about a now-deceased featherweight boxing champion, and in general, haunting is the best descriptor for many of these songs. ""Tonight in Bilbao"" is simply about traveling Europe alone, but man is Kozelek ever alone as he sings about distant lights and train stations. There are a few bits of stage banter included to break up the pristine sadness, and they're all welcome. He makes the audience laugh in most of them, joking about being hot on stage but refusing to take his shirt off at 41 years old. When the lilting lullaby of ""Katy Song"" comes to a sudden stop at the end of the disc, one can't help but be a little surprised-- a record with such a timeless feel hardly seems like it even can end, but like all good things, it does. Kozelek is a powerful performer, and every fan should have at least one of his live recordings. If you haven't heard one yet, this should be the one.","A mostly solo acoustic affair, the Red House Painters man's newest live recording isÂ similar in feel to last year's sparse mini-albumÂ 7 Songs Belfast.

Checkmate Savage,The Phantom Band,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33013d1975652138a2a/1:1/w_160/9b2ab139.jpg,2009-05-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12838-checkmate-savage/,Chemikal Underground,"My due diligence as a reviewer led me to finding out that the Phantom Band released two records in the mid-1990's... and that they are not the same Phantom Band releasing Checkmate Savage. Which really came as a shock, since I can't remember another band since probably Elbow that sounded more mature and fully-formed on their debut. But whereas the latter's Asleep In The Back came on the heels of 10 years of formula-tweaking and bad breaks, Checkmate Savage evolved from winding jam sessions caught on tape by Paul Savage of the Delgados in a nuanced production that isn't too far off from what some would call ""dad rock"". If your dad happened to have Neu! or Beefheart records stashed somewhere, that is. It cuts both ways, though. While Phantom Band play with the assurance of a band far into its career, at times, their approach is so restrained and tasteful that you almost wish they'd show their age more. But it's hard not to sound a little wise beyond your years with the kind of voice flexed by Richard Anthony, falling somewhere on the brogue wave between the frontmen of the Twilight Sad and Frightened Rabbit. But Anthony is more likely to invoke spectral beings in a voice that's got a leathery quality of being both tough and yet luxurious at the same time. ""The Howling"" works itself into a nice pocket with well-placed handclaps and a ringing, cheerful guitar refrain that could have easily been the result of a Keef goof-- the band claims that part of their jam sessions would involve as much parody as woodshedding. It's easy to imagine Anthony elbow-on-knee, fist-on-chin, so commanding and steady is his guidance over the aerodynamic arrangement. It's an undeniably potent beginning, and a welcome dose of muscle in a milieu that often stripmines: comparatively, Deerhunter's ""Nothing Ever Happened"" might sound as thin as, well, Bradford Cox. But muscle does become something of a necessity, since despite their Teutonic underpinnings, the Phantom Band don't exactly groove (like, say, Fujiya & Miyagi) so much as they clamp down and lock in. ""Left Hand Wave"" hitches the gold standard for 21st-century kraut (Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"") to a forceful, bucking bronco rhythm while ""Crocodile"" is the all-encompassing Stereolab encomium that incorporates an assortment of home-made percussion into a bristling, upward space race. But some of the more strictly rhythmic numbers invariably fall flat when they merely dabble in songcraft-- ""Burial Sounds"" never quite extricates itself from a swampy, tom-lead beat while the hip-swiveling chorus of ""Folk Song Oblivion"" is a welcome respite from the strangely tuneless Drop-D grunge of the verses. In a record full of big songs, ""Island"" stands as the obvious money shot, a near-nine-minute sÃ©ance of later Talk Talk. On its face, it passes the looks test, an inky guitar figure echoed by Anthony's spiritual invocations, and later the rest of the band in a ragged chorale. But it lacks a sense of real movement, instead rousting about in its pewter casing. But while Checkmate Savage isn't exactly a record that lacks levity, but the end of ""Throwing Bones"" does cast its surroundings in a different light, particularly after ""Island"". Taken as a whole, it's a chipper diversion, and then you get Checkmate's biggest right hook, a near-barbershop tidal pool of vocals that eventually bridge the gap towards the resigned yet optimistic sundown closer ""The Whole Is on My Side"". Does it work? In a way, not really-- it sounds like something of a send-up of TV on the Radio's ""Ambulance"" (particularly the lower ""ba-doo-ba-doo's""), and while that's a group that could certainly use a pinprick in their side, it's something of a distraction on its own merits. But it does remind the listener about what their most compatible predecessor, the Beta Band, as intriguing as they were infuriating. The Phantom Band has a vice grip on their aesthetic-- in the future, they'd be well-served to know when to let go.","Scottish band's debut isn't too far off from what some would call ""dad rock""-- if your dad happened to have Neu! or Beefheart records stashed somewhere.

Enter the 37th Chamber,El Michels Affair,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4089d034d5c69bf2f83/1:1/w_160/a1c8e064.jpg,2009-05-11 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13011-enter-the-37th-chamber/,Fat Beats,"Over the last few years, the retro-funk revivalists in Brooklyn's El Michels Affair have found themselves inside the inner circle of the Shaolin empire on several different fronts. They've been directly sampled for a Ghostface track (their ""Musings to Myself"" formed the backbone of ""Shakey Dog Starring Lolita""), they've backed up the Wu-Tang Clan and various solo members in a live-show capacity, and they've recorded new backing tracks in the studio with Raekwon (namely a 2007 remake of his noir-soul Pete Rock collabo ""PJ's""). And between all that, they somehow found the time to release a couple of 7"" records featuring their reinterpretations of four of the RZA's most iconic beats: ""C.R.E.A.M."", ""Glaciers of Ice"", ""Duel of the Iron Mic"", and ""Bring the Ruckus"". That side project eventually expanded into their new album Enter the 37th Chamber, their second full-length and an instant rap-geek curio for anyone who likes hearing bands cross the bounds of sample-based and live hip-hop instrumentation. What the El Michels Affair have subsequently come up with is a weird little diversion that's as interesting for its unexpected detours and minor blasphemies as it is for its familiarity. When you're working with reinterpretations of music that often distorted the workings of 1960s and 70s soul into grimy, warped territory, it's almost impossible to play it on standard instruments without having to reel it back in just a little. Just to give you an idea of what we're working with here, their version of ""Uzi (Pinky Ring)"" is a little over three minutes long, and the horns that kicked the door down from the get-go in the original Wu-Tang track don't even come in until after a minute or so of drums-bass-guitar vamping. This and other tweaks-- drastically abbreviating ""Mystery of Chessboxin'"" and spending a third of its length on a melting-analog intro that sounds more like Dr. Octagon's ""Blue Flowers"", or sweetening those spare, piercing string notes from ""Duel of the Iron Mics"" into a weepy violin solo-- could be a natural result of a band trying to make the structure of a loop-based backing track a bit more dynamic in a purely instrumental context. And sometimes they extend it to the point where they kind of lose the original tracks' spirits. Despite their ability to play to a range of moods, as displayed on their fine 2005 debut Sounding out the City, the Affair decided to make even the lighthearted and triumphant moments in their trip through the Wu catalog sound sinister and grim. That includes the jaunty, Dr. Buzzard's-quoting intro of ""Cherchez La Ghost"" and the manic, giggly piano loop from ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"", both of which now sound a bit more like theme music for white-mustached Shaw Brothers villains. And many of these tracks-- fun interpretations as many of them are-- still sound like they're sorely missing the MCs they were originally crafted for, a situation some enterprising mash-up artists are free to try and rectify. But fitting the RZA's productions to a 1:1 ratio isn't quite the point here, even if their approach is still reasonably reverent. Enter the 37th Chamber works best as a series of familiar touchstones sifted through a filter of hazy, almost psychedelic mud-fidelity gloom, getting at the sorrow and menace of classic Wu-Tang at a somewhat different angle. The Affair have a similar ear for diabolical soul sonics and 42nd St. cinema atmosphere as the RZA, but they get to it through a more organic (or at least organic-sounding) route, transforming split-second snippets into fleshed-out licks and choppy loops into glass-smooth riffs. ""C.R.E.A.M."" is the highlight of the set, sweetening the horns, pushing a shivering, stinging guitar melody to a more prominent role and giving that iconic piano riff an understated jolt. ""Criminology"" is a little pared down-- the original's thousand-horn swagger feels a touch lighter in the brass department-- but those stuttering vibes are replicated beautifully and that loping bass-drum backbeat still swings its shoulders wide. And ""Protect Ya Neck""-- well, it sounds like an unusually badass Booker T. & the MGs' instrumental from 1968, which does justice to the Stax/Volt side of RZA's affections. In The 36th Chamber of Shaolin, the movie that inspired the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album title, Gordon Liu masters his training in all 35 chambers of Shaolin and subsequently forms the 36th as a way to teach others outside the temple. Seems that the 37th chamber involves unlearning what you already know.","Wu-affiliated project offersÂ an instant rap-geek curio for anyone who likes hearing bands cross the bounds of sample-based and live hip-hop instrumentation.

We Be Xuxa,Mika Miko,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4079d034d5c69bf2f7f/1:1/w_160/3518435f.jpg,2009-05-11 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13010-we-be-xuxa/,Post Present Medium,"A few years back, it would have been hard to predict that a scuzz-punk duo like No Age would gain wide popularity outside of a niche fanbase, or that the band's all-ages homebase the Smell would come to be seen as one of the preeminent breeding grounds for underground rock. Even as the indie paradigm has shifted towards the noisier, it's still difficult to guess which (if any) of the acts in No Age's wake will go on to find similar success. Surely due for increased attention, though, are Smell torchbearers Mika Miko, a female five-piece specializing in a brash (but danceable) mixture of classic late-70s punk, hardcore thrash, and skronky no wave. Known primarily for the dynamic energy of their stage show, Mika Miko have been operating in some form since the early part of the decade, touring shitloads and scraping together an armful of homemade cassettes and CD-Rs. They embody Smell ideology-- community building, inclusion, steadfast DIY-ness-- and though We Be Xuxa is their first medium-profile release, it's actually the group's 10th official recording. Their brand of industriousness and good-natured punk spirit are fine reasons to like a band (or at least root for them), but the other part of that equation, of course, is enjoying their tunes. And that depends on your outlook: the intentionally basic songs on the 23-minute We Be Xuxa lean heavily on aggression and energy. For those who like their music brief and stupid-simple (and appreciate the various strains of the punk canon Mika Miko are drawing upon), We Be Xuxa can be plenty of fun. Its best tracks, such as shouty opener ""Blues Not Speed"", rumble past at a violent clip with just enough time for the band to do its damage and then peel out in the getaway car. The group has a healthy sense of balance, too, and usually knows when to cut its bitterness with sugar, like on the bouncy call-and-response of ""I Got a Lot (New New New)"". But not all of the record's remaining moments achieve such equilibrium, and since it operates in only two gears-- fast and faster-- there's a tendency for its lesser songs to bleed into one another and become indistinguishable. Indeed, the similar-sounding ""Wild Bore"" and ""Sex"" might as well be one song, and the distinction between neighboring tracks ""On the Rise"" and ""Beat the Rush"" doesn't really exist. That's a problem on a record this short, and generally speaking, We Be Xuxa would benefit from more genre variety. Ironically, when the band does occasionally fiddle with other styles-- notably on the very convincing no-wave boogie of ""Totion"" and their cover of the Urinals' ""Sex""-- they produce some of the record's most memorable material. Something tells me, though, that Mika Miko aren't really that interested in deeper genre explorations or crafting a grand concept piece. They're about turning kids onto punk rock at sweat-soaked backyard parties, and that's pretty cool too.","Overdue for increased attention, this female five-piece specializes in a brash mixture of classic punk, hardcore thrash, and skronky no wave.

Vs. Children,Casiotone for the Painfully Alone,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a409c0084474cd0c03e6/1:1/w_160/5bd19cf0.jpg,2009-05-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13012-vs-children/,Tomlab,"To breed or not to breed? That is the question Owen Ashworth appears to be asking with his fifth full-length outing as Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, the wryly titled Vs. Children. But this is a Casiotone record, which means Ashworth won't provide direct access to his thoughts, relying instead on proxies, personae, and other distancing mechanisms. That is, until the record's third act,Â when a new Casiotone seems to emerge. Before that, however, Ashworth takes us on a joyride with a succession of mostly doomed outlaws and derelicts, with a couple of side excursions into familiar disaffected-slacker-ballad territory. It all adds up to easily the most mature and thematically ambitious Casiotone release to date, a further testament to the talents of a man more in tune with the lives of his generation than many of the folks actually living them. A pair of tracks with unwieldy titles set the scene, the former an account of real-life bicycle-bound bank robber Tom Justice (an apparent one-time acquaintance of Ashworth's), and the latter a similar yarn about life on the lam, this time written in first person. The legend of Bonnie and Clyde looms large over the proceedings-- their names figure into ""Tom Justice"" and a stylized illustration of Faye Dunaway's Bonnie Parker (heavy with the child she'd never have) graces the record's cover. ""What if we'd had the kid?/ I guess it'd be 15,"" Ashworth muses on ""Natural Light"", though it could just as well be a line shared between Barrow's and Parker's ghosts during a midnight graveyard tryst. (Foreshadowing ideas that preoccupy Vs. Children's second half.) That Ashworth can shift so readily between storytelling modes speaks to his considerable skill as a songwriter, one for whom allegory and autobiography are but two routes to the same shared truth. But how, exactly, do we get from bank robbers to baby-making? For Ashworth, it seems that outlaws and unsettled couples are, in a sense, one and the same. Both lead lives that are fundamentally unsustainable, and both, ultimately, are on the run from reality. Yet their carefree exploits are made all the more exhilarating by the tragic inevitability of their surcease. Metaphor and reality at last come into sharp relief on Vs. Children as ""Northfield, MN""-- one last outlaw saga that culminates in a car crash-- is masterfully juxtaposed with ""Killers"". ""Oh my God/ What if we had an accident?/ Oh my God,"" Ashworth begins the latter song in his characteristic mumble. It would seem he's reacting to the previous song's tragedy, until you realize the ""accident"" in question here isn't a vehicular one. ""Till you're dead/ That's how long you're a parent/ Till you're dead,"" he continues, a sentiment that goes straight for the gut and leaves a baby-sized hollow feeling there. Along with subsequent tracks ""Harsh the Herald Angels Sing"" and ""White Jetta"" (and excepting the backward-looking ""You Were Alone""), ""Killers"" suggests the emergence of a new Casiotone. Plenty of ""I""s and ""me""s have found their way into past Ashworth compositions-- indeed, the early Casiotone records were full of self-caricaturizing ones-- but none sound so direct and unfettered as those heard on these songs. ""Harsh"" adopts the perspective of an unwed young woman with child, while ""Jetta"" climaxes with the dying wish of Ashworth's ill mother: for him to start a family. Both should leave even the most hardened listener a bit choked up. ""To stay the same, to never change,"" Ashworth repeatedly incants on ""Jetta"". Whether this is the futile plea of all would-be parents or meta-commentary on the Casiotone project's trajectory (like 2003's Etiquette, Vs. Children utilizes live instruments, though it's still unmistakably a ""Casiotone record"" in every formal way) doesn't matter; like truth and fiction or the personal and the public, changing and staying the same are far from mutually exclusive notions for Owen Ashworth.","Wherein Owen Ashworth fixates on doomed outlaws and comes to terms with what happens when you're not alone anymore.

Are You In?,De La Soul,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40e13d1975652138c0c/1:1/w_160/75848041.jpg,2009-05-11 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13016-are-you-in/,Nike,"Perhaps owing to the lingering psychic scars of forced laps in middle school, I don't run. I'm admitting that up front, not as some sort of badge of lazy-ass pop critic pride, but because I've been tasked to review the latest entry in semi-sinister conglomerate/occasional patron of the arts Nike's Original Run series. This time it's De La Soul, using a late-career corporate sponsorship opportunity to both reaffirm their existence and provide an all-new soundtrack for a 45-minute jog. So caveat emptor for all our fitness-minded readers: I can judge the efficacy of Are You In? only in contexts other than the one intended. But if you, too, are more inclined toward being, well, inclined, know that Are You In? is also an entertaining, intermittently unexpected, and only occasionally unflattering addition to the De La Soul catalog, more or less enjoyable whatever your attitude toward physical exertion. Despite the longest wait yet between De La full-lengths, the trio sounds agreeably engaged, approaching the project less as a formally constricted commission and more as a chance to explore what dancefloor hip-hop might mean in a post-techno world. The answer seems to be old-school sonics (crashing drum machines, electro-tinged melodies, ""Rock Box""-style guitar) spruced up with 21st-century production gloss. Are You In? follows the readymade arc of most ""Original Run"" entries, stuffing everything into a single track that moves more like a DJ set than an album. Large sections are rap-free, letting the throwback beats steadily turn up the tempo to avoid muscle fatigue. And it opens and closes with relaxed, soul-tinged tunes for working up/wiping down a good sweat. But with a catalog full of smooth but never smarmy low-impact jams, we all know De La are masters of laid-back rap, and for a group that's outlived a few dozen hip-hop trends, ""old-school"" doesn't describe an embarrassingly nostalgic affectation so much as an expression of aesthetic continuity. More surprising, if necessarily more inconsistent, are the moments when De La nearly abandon trad hip-hop entirely. While it's commendable they'd avoid simply rewriting their classic material for athletes barely out of tie-dyed onesies when 3 Feet High and Rising dropped, there are definitely missteps. About 20 minutes in, De La drops the kind of high-speed, distorted breaks that would have padded out a pre-crossover Chemical Brothers set. Not sure about referencing ""the new style"" for a sound that peaked 13 years ago-- is it too early for the big beat revival?-- but better amyl-popping hip-house than throwing rote hard rock wank over jazz-tinged snares. Pretty much any time a guitar pops up on Are You In? it's mildly-to-totally cringeworthy, but I do appreciate nodding to the Delicious Vinyl days of stabbing power chords over 808s. But while these heavy metal blunders do mar the album's flow-- from a listener's standpoint, if not necessarily a runner's-- they're also evidence of a gratifying restlessness on the part of an act whose audience might have been content with the same old shit. Elsewhere this creative discontent actually pays dividends for longtime fans: Who knew De La would sound so natural rapping over Detroit-ish synth arpeggios? Given its one-off status and unique format, Are You In? is probably a diversion rather than a reinvention, a mixtape-style curio given big business backing, but hopefully some of its reinvigorated sonics find their way to the next proper De La Soul album. Just so long as they avoid anything with six strings and a distortion pedal.","Nike's Original Run series continues with De La Soul, who are using a late-career corporate sponsorship opportunity to soundtrack your next 45-minute jog.

Mind Raft,Deradoorian,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f6b1335d7bf1698850/1:1/w_160/35248632.jpg,2009-05-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12995-mind-raft/,Lovepump United,"For the sake of transparency, let me start by saying that I'm reviewing Angel Deradoorian's debut EP, Mind Raft, because Angel Deradoorian is the bassist and co-vocalist in Dirty Projectors. I'm guessing she takes this as a mixed blessing: On the one hand, it's probably a little disheartening to consider that the bulk of her audience are DP fans curious about what else the band members might be up to. On the other hand, she's probably fine with the attention, considering that a near-heartbreaking number of albums just as passionate and lovingly crafted as Mind Raft go totally ignored because of time and space limitations. Deradoorian's sound is almost the opposite of the Projectors'-- slow, droning, R&B-influenced folk splattered with blue notes and big drums. (Her own flippant but apt description of Mind Raft is ""An EP with five gothed-out psych tracks for you to do drugs to, or something."" Or something. Listening to the Projectors' convulsive, pointillistic music, it doesn't take a feat of empathy to imagine she needs a breather.) Though the instrumentals are heavy, it's her voice that anchors-- a waxy, seductive instrument that, along with Amber Coffman's, has come to define the Dirty Projectors' sound as much as Dave Longstreth's convulsive squawk. And here, she gets even more room to flaunt its range and character: The sheepish demurrals of indie with the muscle and flutter of genuine R&B; the near-operatic countermelodies of ""Weed Jam"" unfurling into steamy murmurs on ""High Road""; the backing vocals on ""Moon"" that sound like dissonant Bosnian folk. The lyrics are, to my sensibilities, slight, but that's basically irrelevant-- her voice is often so intoxicating that stepping back from my stoked and thoughtless lizard brain to parse her English feels like a waste of concentration (not to mention insulting to her voice). But the songs wander and churn when it feels like they could develop, and ultimately, it's a record that I'll never mind having on but probably rarely reach for. (Oddly, for all the EP's quiet eclecticism, it's the relatively straightforward blues dirge ""Holding Pattern"" that I find stickiest.) Isn't there some cute aphorism about how napkin sketches by innately talented artists are more fascinating than the dedicated brushwork of someone who, on some inaccessible and deep spiritual level, will just never get it? If not, imagine that there is, because I'm going to need for you consider it now. Mind Raft, for its probably good intentions, sounds like sketches from a young musician with obvious talent who hasn't exerted herself just yet. I realize I'm doing some rhetorical hand-wringing here: For all I know, these five songs required a huge amount of effort and will be the closest Deradoorian gets to the godhead-- but I just don't think that's the case. She's 22, very capable, and her stylistic blend is more interesting and unusual than that of plenty of her peers. If you need a hand reconciling the numerical score with that bit of clinical gloss, I'll just say that if I had to review Dave Longstreth's first solo album, 2002's The Graceful Fallen Mango, I don't know that I could confidently say it's all that much better than Deradoorian's is. To the future.","Dirty Projectors bassist and co-vocalist strikes out on her own with a five-song EP of slow, droning, R&B-influenced folk.

Ascenseur Ouvert!,Kingsbury Manx,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ed13d1975652138bc8/1:1/w_160/c3a08af8.jpg,2009-05-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12986-ascenseur-ouvert/,Odessa,"On the Kingsbury Manx's 2000 self-titled debut, artist M. Scott Myers painted a house for the cover, set in the middle distance but crowded off to the side, overlooking a geometrically jagged shoreline. Nine years, four albums, and two labels later, Myers has painted his fifth Manx cover (sixth if you count the one for their 2003 EP Afternoon Owls), this time a photorealistic cathedral so gargantuan it can't all fit into the frame. This evolution from a house of man to a house of god is potentially misleading, as the North Carolina band has made no such spiritual or musical evolution. They've remained about the same size, picking up new tricks with every album but barely changing their approach at all. Sure, they were fuzzier and scratchier on middle child Aztec Discipline, but they soon abandoned that tack. Not that they need to change things up all that much. Their shambling, subdued, sophisticated Southern folk-pop-- which is soft but never mellow, and uses slow tempos almost as a statement of defiance-- sprung forth fully formed in 2000, and since then they've explored different facets of that sound, turning it over in their hands to study every angle and possibility. On Ascenseur Ouvert!, their sound remains as durable, as engaging, and as immersive as ever, their lyrics gently witty and their arrangements subtly intricate. ""I never walked on water but I keep my body dry,"" sings Bill Taylor on the loping opener ""Walk on Water"". ""A dirty hand wipes dusty cobwebs from my eyes."" That couplet, boosted by Ryan Richardson's harmonies, sounds crucial to the album: Perhaps it's an acknowledgment of the four long years between their last album and this one. Real life intrudes: There have been new babies, jobs that actually pay, moves, upheavals. But those lines also suggest that the Kingsbury Manx know they have always flown under the radar, never even becoming indie big or internet famous. Their music is not flashy, but observant and adult, and Ascenseur Ouvert!, which is their first for Carrboro-based Odessa Records, may be their most engaging and cohesive album since their first, maybe their second. Perhaps the years away have sharpened their focus and made these recording sessions seem all the more do-or-die (another full circle: They recorded the album in Duck Kee Studio in Mebane, North Carolina, where they worked on their debut). Ascenseur Ouvert! strikes their finest balance so far between sonics and songcraft. These are well-put-together compositions full of clever turns of phrase and crisp imagery. At times it sounds like a potential break-up album, juggling what-might-have-beens with what-really-went-downs. On ""Mend/Move"", the song with the most spring in its step tempo-wise, Taylor promises, ""I'd never write a song just to try to poke fun at you/ No, I'd never do you wrong even though I'm all done with you."" On the first few listens, that sounds like a diplomatic gesture toward an ex, but ambiguity rises with every listen: Does he even think she's worth writing about? Probably not, since he uses that dismissive phrase ""I'm all done with you."" Then again, he did write ""Mend/Move."" What sounds like a fond farewell turns out to be just a farewell. The Kingsbury Manx wrap that and every other dodgy sentiment in music that sounds loose and casual despite its complexity, peppering the songs with inspired flourishes. A guitar zigs and zags jazzily throughout the strummy ""Well, Whatever"", the relatively naked ""George Closing"" is nothing but warm vocals and lonely piano, and ""Over the Oeuvre"" pauses for a short Beach Boyish vocal breakdown that shows off the band's lush harmonies. Their voices have always blended effortlessly, adding a distinctive element to their arrangements. In this regard, the loveliest and most inventive track on Ascenseur Ouvert! may be the vocal-heavy ""Minos Maze"", on which their wordless harmonies cascade over a soft bed of strings, synth tracers that shoot across the song. Its slow, patient tempo only reinforces the song's impact, allowing them to fully invest themselves in the moment. Often accused of sounding the same on every album-- as if reliability and focus were faults-- the Kingsbury Manx are really just watching the world speed up around them and refusing to change their pace to match.","More subdued and sophisticated Southern folk-pop from this North Carolina band, which has been both consistent and overlooked for almost a decade.

The Atlantic Ocean,Richard Swift,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f1b1335d7bf1698843/1:1/w_160/7c3e67de.jpg,2009-05-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12990-the-atlantic-ocean/,Secretly Canadian,"A former keyboard player in the vaguely Catherine Wheel-ish contemporary Christian group Starflyer 59, Richard Swift struck out on his own at the turn of the decade. His first two records, Walking Without Effort and The Novelist, came out on as a double album in 2005 on Secretly Canadian, and he's been putting out music in dribs and drabs ever since then. All of it has been perfectly competent but a little dull, suggesting an MOR-indie mind-meld of Ron Sexsmith, Michael Penn, and Andrew Bird. On last year's head-turning Ground Trouble Jaw EP, however, Swift switched things up, ditching the midtempo piano ballads for strutting, ersatz blue-eyed soul and warbling in a killer, outrageously goofy Frank Zappa-meets-Bobby Darrin falsetto over loving recreations of Spencer Davis Group oldies. The EP was slight but unexpectedly winning, and it signaled a shift in direction that sets the stage nicely for the grander affair that is The Atlantic Ocean, his first proper full-length since 2007's Dressed Up For the Letdown. Wisely keeping the looseness he found on Ground Trouble Jaw, Swift spruces everything else up with the sort of painstaking classicist touches that overly ambitious singer/songwriters have spent hours in the studio refining since at least Todd Rundgren's Something/Anything?. Rundgren's soft-rock opus actually makes for a decent entry point into The Atlantic Ocean. Like Rundgren, Swift slips a surprising amount of bitterness and acrid observation into his smooth AM-radio soul songs, which are built on the laid-back earthiness and jazzy chord voicings of 1970s Carole King. ""Spend your prayers, I'm an unbeliever and I don't feel right/ I can barely sleep at night/ Got no one to make me cry/ And everyone knows when they're gonna die,"" he croons beautifully on ""R.I.P."" (Man, that Starflyer 59 breakup must have been brutal.) Both have a fondness for injecting blurts of ""wacky"" studio noise into their compositions; see the quivering jello mold of keyboards perched atop ""The Original Thought"". Also like Rundgren, Swift spends a lot of time honing the most devastating takedown of his exes he can manage while finding the prettiest way to couch it. ""It's already gone, hang your head, hold your tongue/ Because it's nobody's fault but our own,"" he sings sweetly over the lilting waltz rhythms of ""Already Gone"". Rundgren isn't the only obsessive studio rat Swift will remind you of, though. ""Ballad of Old What's His Name"" is a nice compendium of all of Swift's touchpoints: slide guitar lines that ape George Harrison's tone and cadence so closely that you almost check to make sure you didn't accidentally put on ""Savoy Truffle""; barrelhouse piano and an airy vocal melody that evokes Harry Nilsson; a harmonizing backup choir of sweetly sighing Swifts; and an outbreak of horn charts at the bridge. ""The First Time"", on the other hand, opens with a chugging little drum machine and a single plunking banjo, sounding before the verse begins for all the world like the work of the blonder, prettier Swift. ""The End of an Age"", meanwhile, has a sweetly autumnal horn coda that could have been ported in from a Burt Bacharach song. All of this namechecking, by the way, tends to pop up in reviews when the album in question isn't quite vivid enough to stand on its own terms, and, well, check: Swift is hugely talented musician and a meticulous craftsman, but his voice isn't terribly distinct, and as a result his albums usually end up being a bundle of good ideas lacking an animating force. Swift has figured out how to make pretty music, but he hasn't found anything compelling to say through it. ""I got the right LPs, I got the Lou Reed and all the Blondie you'll never need,"" he sings on the title track, and it illustrates, once again, the wide gulf separating an immaculate record collection from the ability to do anything interesting with it.","Picking up where last year's head-turningÂ Ground Trouble Jaw EP left off, Richard Swift here continues his exploration ofÂ strutting, blue-eyed soul.

Entertainment,Fischerspooner,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40ab1335d7bf1698877/1:1/w_160/5d73905c.jpg,2009-05-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13013-entertainment/,LoFS Studios,"It's been nine years since Larry Tee, the man who coined the term ""electroclash,"" put on the first Electroclash festival. Rather than looking at how that scene died, it's interesting to see how many of those festival headliners-- Fisherspooner, Peaches, Ladytron, Scissor Sisters-- survived. (Not to mention that nobody sniffs at later electro-pop bands like Hot Chip, Justice, Crystal Castles, CSS, etc.) Maybe the key for the the duo behind Fisherspooner (composer Warren Fischer and singer/performer Casey Spooner) is that they don't consider themselves ""dance musicians"" in the conventional sense. ""I mean our music isn't really dance music,"" Fischer told Pitchfork's Tom Breihan in a recent interview. ""I don't really know what genre it would lie in. I guess it's kind of like indie pop or pop music."" They always were, and still consider themselves, an art project first (notice he says ""our music"" rather than ""we""). As they said, they get commissioned for dance pieces (the kind performed in concert halls), not for remixes. Their shows are built on spectacle rather than the charisma of any one of their players, including frontman Spooner. Unfortunately for a band that tries to turn glitter and polish into art, Entertainment is a lackluster performance. Here they almost become the indie pop group they claim they've always been, but the irony of their cries against capitalism and artifice ultimately fail without compelling songs to keep them afloat. Entertainment begins promisingly. Lush opener ""The Best Revenge"" scans as old Fischerspooner sleaze for its first few seconds, but then the track shudders awake with broken keyboard notes and a dated but delightful horn line-- the kind where you hope someone yells ""Blow, daddy!"" But no one ever does. ""At what cost? There is a price,"" warns Spooner. He lives by this admonishment throughout Entertainment (the title perhaps evoking that other anti-capitalist ""dance"" band, Gang of Four). The stance is funny (though understandable) coming from a band you'd always suspect was created exclusively for readers of BlackBook. Some of his warnings-- ""Currency can only do so much"" (""Money Can't Dance""), ""What's real? What's fake"" (""In a Modern World""), or ""It's no one's fault but our own,"" from their slippery anti-war track ""Infidels of the World Unite"", ring insincere, an unfortunate side-effect of Spooner's deadened vocals. Fischerspooner's bolder attempts at pop, like the flute-backed twee verse towards the end of ""Money Can't Dance"" and the more personal ""Door Train Home"", hint at something more interesting. The latter song is unusual here: though Spooner's still deadpan, his specificity and intimate lyrics make up for the rather broad strokes of sawtooth synth and whining guitar from his partner. But there are far too many tracks on Entertainment where both members are sleepwalking. ""We Are Electric"" comes off particularly half-hearted; Fischer cycles the song's tinny, repetitive synth pattern though different filters while Spooner intones the title line over and over. Both halves play like they were written for different songs with no thought given to how they'd get along. For a group not making dance music, their danciest tracks are still their best. ""To the Moon"" coalesces in all the right ways: found audio detritus blends into a likable, warm synth melody and a layered, exultant beat. Slivers of violin and keyboards are inserted into all the best spots, and even Spooner finds an elementary vocal melody before backing out gracefully. It works in this context, for a group that seems all about context. Like, ""Danse En France""'s textured, fractured pieces and spoken intro don't work until you know that the song was commissioned for a particular dance company, and is based on a hilarious story of casual sex via boneheaded Americanism. So Entertainment might be music for their performances, it might be for others' dance performances, but it's not for the dance floor. Those halves that don't quite fit? They're begging to be pulled apart and put back together by heavier hands.","This New York-based art project made its mark during the first wave of electroclash and now returns with its first full-length album in four years.

Arctic Monkeys at the Apollo,Arctic Monkeys,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40b13d1975652138c03/1:1/w_160/501137e1.jpg,2009-05-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13014-arctic-monkeys-at-the-apollo/,Domino,"""I always find live shows on film kind of boring. Even my favorite ones, I kinda zone out for most of it.... There's just a visceral thing that never translates very well."" That's none other than Mr. Arcade Fire, Win Butler, talking to this website about his band's risky recent documentary, Miroir Noir. And he's absolutely right. Like most notable rock films-- from Don't Look Back to Gimme Shelter to recent winner Glastonbury-- Miroir Noir isn't a mere chronicle of a band on a stage playing to people who are singing along. The film features bits of recording-session footage and offbeat montages along with grainy snips of shows; by adding elements of non-show spontaneity, Miroir Noir translates a real live gig's snap that much better. Arctic Monkeys at the Apollo-- which was released in the UK last November and hits the U.S. this week with a bonus live CD-- shows the Sheffield quartet on stage at the Manchester Apollo playing to people who are singing along. The end. You are now permitted to zone out. Well, not just yet, maybe. Apollo at least attempts to be more than just another concert movie. Instead of going with quick cuts and crisp-but-soulless HD video, editor Nick Fenton (Sigur RÃ³s'Â Heima) favors longer tracking shots and director Richard Ayoade (""The Mighty Boosh"") and director of photography Danny Cohen (This Is England) go with Super 16 film to give the piece a more cinematic feel. But there's only so much one can do with lens flares and light trails (there are plenty of both throughout). The relatively artistic filming techniques are worn out within the first 10 minutes of the 76-minute movie. So it's up to the Monkeys themselves to put on the show of their lives-- to make something worth popping in the DVD player for years to come. Too bad this band isn't ready for such a document. They've got songs and charisma, but not enough to support a release like Apollo just yet. It's the last concert of their 2007 world tour, but instead of leaving all their sweat and/or guts on the floor, they just look a bit tired. And while lead singer Alex Turner's wise ass snarl comes through on record, his brattiness almost reads as condescension here-- he tells the Manchester audience they're being fed to the center of Berlin via satellite as a joke, but nobody really gets it. The crowd is given short-shrift throughout, too; their vocal participation is largely muted and the cameras stay trained on the Monkeys the whole time, giving the film a hermetic feel, as if it were taped in an antiseptic studio. Aside from drummer Matt Helders, whose technical skill and enthusiasm is admirable here, the Monkeys teeter between off-the-cuff and off-the-mark; there is a difference between fuck-all and fuck-off. Songs that allow Turner to breathe-- ""Do Me a Favour"", ""505"", ""When the Sun Goes Down""-- offer a little release from the wound-up monotony, but they're not enough. Concert DVDs are a good, cheap way for record companies to recoup losses from the decline of album sales but, as more and more flood the market, their second-hand POV quickly becomes ineffectual. Because, without any sort of originality, innovation, or personality, something like Apollo may as well be a YouTube fan clip. (At least that way we could have heard the real-life audience reactions.) Arctic Monkeys try to keep it respectable with experienced men behind the cameras and just-grainy-enough film stock, but all that is moot without something compelling to watch. This is frustrating, especially since recent YouTube videos with Diddy prove these guys have humor and chumminess to spare-- why not work that into this DVD at some point? Near the very end of Apollo, the film abruptly and briefly cuts to a quick moving reel of behind-the-scenes footage of the band goofing around. They make weird faces, Turner hammily leads the camera to a picturesque oceanside locale. It's a great montage-- and it's over in 30 seconds.","Sheffield band teams with filmmakers behind ""The Mighty Boosh"", This Is England, and Sigur RÃ³s' Heima for a concert DVD and its accompanying CD.

He penned multi-paragraph treatises on great old records and current releases alike, illustrated with drool-worthy snaps of LP sleeves from his own shelves. He rarely offered MP3 downloads; indeed, he often expressed serious (and reasonable) ethical reservations about doing so. (An oddity then, and almost anathema now.) His writerly voice, alternately cantankerous and self-effacing, was that of a man trying to make sense of a life lived with music, rather than someone cataloging downloading habits and passing promo MP3 fancies. The blog's retirement was our loss as readers, even if its owner seems to have hung up his keyboard with a deserved sense of accomplishment rather than regret. But Ingram's finally turned to making music, or at least releasing it for public consumption. On his website, synthesizing the promotional announcement and the aesthetic manifesto, Ingram calls for 21st-century listeners to ""celebrate the integrity of hand-made art"" and ""discover the local."" Born from that back-to-basics mindset, these two EPs extoll the pleasures of the idiosyncratic and locally-grown at a time when critics often use the phrase ""niche-oriented"" as a pejorative. Automat and East Central One are extensions of Ingram's philosophy in both sound and presentation. For starters, they're palm-sized 3"" CDs, each adorned with a linocut capturing the sharpened tips of London's gothic skyline, beautifully printed on pleasingly heavy stock. They have that warm DIY feel Ingram valorizes, but they're also stark, a little chilly-- handcrafts of the microchip era. (None of the sloppy cut-and-paste that characterizes the post-noise CD-R/cassette swap underground here.) And that organic/digital blurring extends to the eight tracks, four on each CD. Automat and (especially) East Central One map the same coordinates as Woebot-the-blog: The bass-heavy history of modern British dance music, spiked with bits of jazz, post-industrial/punk, academic composition, and other semi-popular sounds. Perhaps literally culled from Ingram's omnivorous (but discerning) record collection and built on an old-school sampler, the tracks often have a pleasingly rough quality, their loops audibly punched-in from warm, worn vinyl. Drums clonk and tumble like dizzily pitched-down hip hop; sinister drones slither like avant horror-movie muzak in the background; phantom voices and mournful melodic motifs wind their way through the murk. At times, these EPs hearken back to the earliest, most stylistically unpredictable days of trip-hop and ""home-listening"" techno. Automat's surreal appeal represents the side of Ingram's aesthetic that delights in alternately antic and gloomy grooves that bubble with strange samples. On ""Hit It"", it's James Brown's soulful grunts and a Bambaataa-era robot voice that leaven the spookiness. ""Cheese"", a duet for gloomy piano and techno-esque synth pings, would be ambient music of a particularly austere kind, if not for the repeated sample of a woman talking about making her own cheese. (Talk about celebrating the ""hand-made"" and ""local."") ""Bear Market Rally"", and its riot of stabbing jazz horns, is both whimsical and faintly unnerving, which is a pretty succinct description of the Woebot sound as a whole. East Central One is darker and riddled with fewer manic samples. Instead, it's the the drums that sound agitated on ""Chiblains"", which is drum and bass reduced to sketchy, tetchy snares and trilling strings. The low-end that pulses throughout both discs-- a heaviness that lingers even when the tracks are stripped of obvious basslines-- would seem to owe a bit to dubstep, as does the overall eerie mood. But instead of dubstep's fractured rhythms and recent taste for chirpy 8-bit video game sonics, the swooping strings of ""Salami"" evoke Duke Ellington's languorous ethno-fantasias. There are faint hints of current and past genres-- trends, even-- audible on both EPs. But the logic behind Ingram's collage is wholly his own. Listening to ECO closer ""Flapper"", it's hard to imagine anyone else who'd cut glitching I.D.M. with one bridge that sounds like a distended take on Eric Dolphy's Out To Lunch, and another that nods in the direction of Mtume's smooth 80s electro-soul. This wild combination-- its creator's voice clearly audible even if its joints are not-- is a reminder that the best sample-based music has always possessed Ingram's ""integrity of hand-made art.""","Former longtime and highly respected blogger Woebot releases 3"" CDs, full of music leaning on the bass-heavy history of modern British dance music.

T.I.M.E. Soundtrack,Odd Nosdam,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f4c0084474cd0c03b4/1:1/w_160/a5d5c253.jpg,2009-05-07 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12993-time-soundtrack/,Anticon,"It was my favorite record of 2008, so I suppose I'm inclined to overstate the influence of a stray line from Why?'s Alopecia. Nonetheless, Yoni Wolf endorsed the sprawling catalogue of producer David Madson aka Odd Nosdam on ""A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under"" by deadpanning, ""rain goes perfect with a Nosdam mixtape."" Sure as hell got me interested. And then Nosdam's first record since then is... a soundtrack to an Element skateboarding video that I'll probably never see. And all I know about skateboarding is what I unwittingly picked up hanging with the only other kids in high school who listened to Ma$e and Dr. Octagon. Strange as it sounds, that's actually a decent set of coordinates for T.I.M.E. Soundtrack, which has just enough polish and structure to appeal to those who aren't typically checking for Anticon's version of weirdo hip-hop, but enough of a crate-diggers vibe to please those who are. It's less a mixtape than an appropriately compartmentalized series of segments, each long enough to establish mood but never outstaying its welcome. Though Nosdam always takes the opportunity to introduce new and often sensuous textures and elements in each track, he never strays far from a grainy boom-bap that provides enough muscle to justify Element's decision to keep Pennywise out of this one. The synth sound that links ""T.I.M.E. In"" and ""T.I.M.E. Out"" splits the difference between Swizz Beatz and Heatmakerz, but in the latter portion, it's cooled down by ribbitting tremolo guitar. Meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky bass lick on ""Fly Mode"" is the sort of thing that could sell a Volkswagen, and the rollicking guitars on ""We Bad Apples"" functions as a tip that Nosdam might have as much of a stake in making pop music than something to spit 16 over. And yet, for all of the urgency it's supposed to give way to, T.I.M.E. still can sound less like something being played by an audio device as something revived from your memory-- the two biggest influences hereÂ are dust and shadow, not just the physical properties, but the capital letter versions with the addendums ""-Brothers"" and ""DJ-."" Amidst so many tasty morsels, ""Top Rank"" can feel like a clearinghouse at first, a five-minute exploration jammed right into the middle of T.I.M.E. In a good way, it reminds me of how ""Kingdom Come"" bisected the Mae Shi's HLLLYH-- essentially, it's an exploratory roll call of all the good ideas interspersed throughout-- dubby bass, the sort of snowdriven guitars heard on The Campfire Headphase, hooky vibraphone. If you're looking to find a mood that T.I.M.E. could be classified under, look no further than the title of the self-explanatory ""Ethereal Slap"". I guess it's indicative of my own ignorance on the topic, but the line that always keeps popping into my head is Steve Malkmus' tossed-off yet evocative ""Out on my skateboard/ The night is just humming."" In a way, it works-- T.I.M.E. is as visceral or cerebral as you'd like. While it's easy to imagine people pulling killer kick flips or whatever in your mind's eye while the album is playing, the music itself has enough forthrightness and inventiveness to be one of the year's most enjoyable, if low-key, surprises.","Odd Nosdam's latest has enough polish and structure to appeal to non-Anticon fans, but also a crate-digger vibe to please those into the avant-hip-hop label.

Primary Colours,The Horrors,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fa13d1975652138be3/1:1/w_160/c1509e2a.jpg,2009-05-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12998-primary-colours/,XL,"Hype works both ways: Just as it encourages the overestimation of underdeveloped bands, it can also result in the knee-jerk dismissal of any upstart act with the (mis)fortune of being plastered on the cover of NME before the debut EP's even been recorded. Of course, East London quintet the Horrors didn't do themselves any favors by presenting themselves in a conceptual wrapping that seemingly had all the staying power of last night's mascara, mining a well-tapped vein of ghoulish American garage-rock, prancing around in cartoonishly goth get-ups, and putting on sloppy, self-sabotaging 15-minute sets, all for the amusement of their celebrity guest list. But the band's media-saturated ascent distracted from the fact that the Horrors had actually done their homework: Their 2006 debut EP featured covers of two Joe Meek-produced, Pebbles-approved classics and on the subsequent tour, the band's pre-show PA mix included tracks by the Seeds, the Cramps, and Gun Club. And after struggling to keep the shock-rock shtick fresh over the entirety of 2007's Strange House full-length, the Horrors were smart enough to recognize garage-rock's aesthetic limitations-- and that the very sort of garage-rock purist who would appreciate a good cover of Screaming Lord Sutch's ""Jack the Ripper"" had probably already written them off on the basis of their poofy haircuts. And so the Horrors' desire to make campy, B-movie-inspired punk-rock seems to have died along with Lux Interior. Their second album, Primary Colours, contains no haunted-house Farfisa organ drones, no blues-rock riffing and no songs about graveyards or murderers, a change reflected in their choice of producers; where Strange House was helmed by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner, the expansive sound of Primary Colours was fashioned by the trio of Geoff Barrow (Portishead), Craig Silvey, and video director Chris Cunningam. The recently released first teaser from Primary Colours, ""Sea Within a Sea"", sees that production tandem's cinematic sensibility in full effect, with eight minutes of steely Krautrock propulsion that recasts lead shrieker Faris Badwan as a lovelorn crooner. On first listen, the song seems antithetical to the Horrors' patented goth-garage gimmickry; but the amazing thing about Primary Colours is that, by the time ""Sea Within a Sea"" appears as the album's come-down closer, the transition feels like a natural outcome. There is, of course, clear precedent in transforming gothic gloom into psychedelic drone: After all, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Spacemen 3 and My Bloody Valentine-- all of whom loom large on Primary Colours-- were all big fans of the Cramps and the Birthday Party. But unlike downcast contemporaries like Crystal Stilts, the Horrors translate the influence of those avant-rock icons into swaggering, mass-appeal pop music: ""Three Decades"" may lean heavily on MBV-style flange-pedal contortions, but its driving momentum and Badwan's full-blooded delivery lend it an anthemic, open-road abandon, matched by uncommonly optimistic lyrics: ""Forget your regrets/ Don't lose your purpose, this is your heart!"" The song provides the first glimpse that, beneath his vampy visage, Badwan fancies himself a romantic. ""Do You Remember"" may sound like a readymade soundtrack for student-disco one night stands, but within its decadent, Suede-ian glam groove is a promise for long-term commitment, and in the beautifully brooding ballad ""Scarlet Fields"", the Horrors appropriate the melody of Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" but use it to convey hope instead of resignation. The Horrors' shoegazer makeover aside, the real story here is Badwan's growing confidence as a singer, and his willingness to sound more scared than scary. Primary Colours loses its radiance when he reverts back to bogeyman type: ""New Ice Age"" sounds like a musty Strange House holdover, while ""I Can't Control Myself"" is a rewrite of Spiritualized's ""Come Together"" that-- in the absence of Jason Pierce's gospel choir and backing orchestra-- simply grinds its repetitive riff into the ground. But such regressions are a distant memory once we get sucked into ""Sea Within a Sea"", which, after you get beyond the ""hey, we bought a Can record"" novelty, proves to be something much more than a mere clinical exercise in record-collector rock. Rather, the song plays out as an analogue of the Horrors' own spiritual rebirth, its hypno-rock pulse turning more ominous and intense before a synth-triggered denouement introduces a melodic levity that breaks the song's air of despair and completes the Horrors' aesthetic liberation. For a band that's endured no lack of skepticism for their pre-fab packaging, it turns out the freakiest thing about the Horrors is that they're for real.","Much-derided and hyped UK band takes an unexpected, and rewarding, left turn on its second album.

Balf Quarry,Magik Markers,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4029d034d5c69bf2f73/1:1/w_160/64817473.jpg,2009-05-07 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13004-balf-quarry/,Drag City,"If a band makes two records that move their sound in the same direction, is it fair to call the first a step forward and the second a retread? No, it's not. So please don't call Balf Quarry a repeat of BOSS, Magik Markers' excellent 2007 album*.* I understand the temptation-- like its predecessor, Balf Quarry channels this duo's noisy leanings into simpler songs without sacrificing the band's fiery energy.Â There are even some direct parallels-- the best song here, the chugging ""Don't Talk in Your Sleep"", bears echoes of BOSS' single ""Taste"", while the raging ""Jerks"" recalls BOSS' ""Body Rot"". And when heard in light of a 20-plus release discography (including at least seven since BOSS), Balf Quarry certainly sounds more like BOSS than anything else the band has done. But it takes only a few listens to realize that this album is its own beast. Even with healthy doses of unruliness and a few far-off wanderings, this is Magik Markers' most coherent, self-contained effort to date. A friend called it ""a road trip into the basement,"" and that pretty well captures the album's America-in-the-rear-view-mirror vibe. As the smoky grooves roll by, it's easy to picture singer/guitarist Elisa Ambrogio and drummer Pete Nolan camped out in a cellar, dreaming that their loose, swaying songs are treks down a hazy, endless highway. ""Smash out the glass of the dashboard clocks/ Drive straight into the West,"" Ambrogio sings in opener ""Risperdal"", a diary of a country where ""America's past pays America's rent"" and ""High schoolers and Haggard know what I know."" (At song's end, Ambrogio changes that line to ""High schoolers and Hagerty""-- perhaps a nod to Neil Hagerty and Royal Trux, a band who could also sound like they were concocting alternate Easy Rider soundtracks from the comfort of dank underground dwellings). Elsewhere, Ambrogio drops numerous references to road-drenched Americana. Her songs are littered with gamblers, lawmen, whiskey, and losing lottery tickets. This makes Balf Quarry something like a 1970s indie film shot through a modern-day lens, similar to the way Vincent Gallo's The Brown Bunny felt like a simultaneously faded and updated road-movie replica. So you probably need some penchant for American nostalgia and noisy stoner-rock to dig very far into Balf Quarry. But if you can hack it, there are pots of gold along the album's wayward avenues. On ""Psychosomatic"", clipped guitar and cutting drums embolden Ambrogio's screed against thinking too hard (""If you start looking, do you know what you'll find?"") Later, a crunchy electronic beat buttresses Ambrogio and Nolan's vocal duo on the love-song-ish ""7/23"". That's followed by the even more surprising ""State Numbers"", a ballad about the dangers of gambling featuring Nolan on piano and producer Scott Colburn on ""wizard wind."" ""Luck never gives, it only lends,"" Ambrogio warns over the music's haunting tones. Her most pointed rant, ""The Lighter Side of...Hippies"", is an indictment of something bigger: 60s idealism. ""You had a revolution in your head/ Too bad you couldn't make it out of bed,"" she snarls, telling the boomers that ""your heroes lied."" In fact, here she wholly rejects the road fantasies that Balf Quarry had hinted at before: ""No more forever young on the turnpike/ The sunshine visions were not what they seemed."" But even Easy Rider itself ended with Peter Fonda deciding that ""we blew it,"" and the dreams and disappointments Ambrogio sings about are often intertwined. Balf Quarry is the kind of record that can handle such rich, entertaining contradictions.","Continuing in the vein of 2007'sÂ BOSS, Magik Markers hereÂ channel their noisy leanings into simpler songs without sacrificing the band's fiery energy.

"Set 'Em Wild, Set 'Em Free",Akron/Family,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e99d034d5c69bf2f31/1:1/w_160/8f75a4b9.jpg,2009-05-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12980-set-em-wild-set-em-free/,Dead Oceans,"Like Parliament or Red Krayola before them, Akron/Family's career path is so varied and unexpected it's silly to expect their albums to represent growth or progression. So on a superficial level the main differences between Set 'Em Wild, Set 'Em Free and Akron's previous work is the departure of Ryan Vanderhoof (who left after recording Love Is Simple) and that they're now releasing those strained analogies on Dead Oceans instead of Michael Gira's Young God. Anybody worried that it was Gira's skeletal hand that was keeping the Family weird can rest easy. OpenerÂ ""Everyone Is Guilty"" skips groove in favor of skronk, employing a hard, scat-worthy verse vocal and billowing, aggressive guitar breaks. The song ends with a small, creeping symphony-- horns, strings, and a flute carrying the song to a peaceable conclusion.Â It's a strident opener, one that signalsÂ Set âEm Wild will trend darker than 2007's excellent Love Is Simple. Remaining members Seth Olinsky, Miles Seaton, and Dana Janssen usually skew toward the abstract lyrically, making it difficult to sayÂ Set 'Em is ""about"" anything, but the album's final line-- ""Last year was a hard year/ For such a long time/ This year's gonna be ours""-- and title point toward an airing of grievances. Either way, the vibe doesn't seem to be anger so much as perseverance, especially during the album's balmy, tempered middle. During that middle section, Set âEm Wild balances the strangeness of tracks like ""Everyone Is Guilty"" with worthy but, you know, normal art-rock. ""River"" doesn't necessarily follow standard rock patterns, but the way its instruments interact-- pattering toms enter with robust guitar licks, a tempered horn solo on the bridge-- is decidedly regular. The title track's country-pastoral lope or ""Many Ghosts""' eerie balladry are slight tweaks on formulas. Cryptic, pretty statements are floated: ""You are no longer river to me... You are no longer docile stream."" For all of their idiosyncrasies and Zeus-ian chest baring, the differences between Akron and everyrocker troupes like Arcade Fire or Broken Social Scene aren't always so large. This isn't a slight (though the mewling ""The Alps & Their Orange Evergreen"" is the closest the band has ever come to unplugged alterna-rock), especially because Akron use their most traditional moments as launching pads for their freak. What other reason to sequence the album's two oddest tracks-- the crashing clay guitars of ""MBF"" and the beefy ""They Will Appear""-- after the album's comparatively placid middle third? Those songs recall the woolly prog-epics the band explored on 2006's Meek Warrior; here, though, they feel welcomingly disruptive. The band's now-routine gospel-likeÂ chanting grows tiresome by album end (they miss Vanderhoof's vocals), and, as was expected, Set âEm Wild doesn't necessarily expand the band's sound so much as further splinter their interest. Brief ear-piquing moments-- the white noise fadeout of ""Sun Will Shine (Warmth of the Sunship Version)"" is followed by a boozy horn section playing ""Auld Lang Syne"", but at this point in the band's development even that doesn't shock. Celebratory standards, talk of a ""geese nation,"" tie-dyed American flags...despite the changes this is still the same Family.","After weathering a lineup change and a move from Young God to Dead Oceans, the always surprising art-rock group's new album carries an air ofÂ perseverance.

Replica Sun Machine,The Shortwave Set,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a403c0084474cd0c03d6/1:1/w_160/b54753b5.jpg,2009-05-06 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13005-replica-sun-machine/,Wall of Sound,"Why would someone want a replica sun machine, when we have a real sun, which is completely free to use? The Shortwave Set don't care about practical questions such as this, of course-- they're fine with their LP title being a fancy, six-syllable way to say ""lamp."" A second question arises, then: Why make things so unnecessarily complicated, and then be coy about it? It's semantics, sure, but also a useful way to think about the group and their latest album.Â Replica Sun Machine is an exceedingly simple thing-- with tunes so familiar-feeling to be easily ignorable--Â but it's presented with a false sense of intricacy, gussied up and disguised as something more than it really is.Â Now, the important question: Is it any wonder that Danger Mouse signed on to produce it? The Shortwave Set and Danger Mouse have a lot in common: They're both highly competent at what they do--Â artfully, but not flashily, recombining recognizable music and cultural signifiers into pleasing new shapes.Â And like the technologies that the Set are enamored of, when they do their jobs really well, they just disappear.Â TakeÂ ""Now 'til '69"",Â for example, whichÂ operates in the same careful nostalgic register as a PT Cruiser, right down to its lastÂ ""be bop a lula""Â and Jerry Lee Lewis piano pound.Â It sounds positively huge and incredibly clean, like a well-funded local theater putting on aÂ ""rock'n'roll""Â revue, and that's the prevailing tone of the album: Everything feels factory-stamped, looked over by Inspector #22, and mostly bereft of any humanity whatsoever.Â There's a reason thatÂ ""Glitches 'N' Bugs""Â sounds so nostalgic, after all: Those things are ironed out well in advance of the shipping date. And that's the rub withÂ Replica.Â The Shortwave Set fetishize the leftovers of 20th century consumer culture, but while adopting the same generic approach toward musical style.Â The waltz-time refrain fromÂ ""Distant Daze"",Â surrounded by lustrous piano, fuzzed-out guitars and 1950s sci-fi sound effects, could be the Set's ""Statement of Principles"", tacked to the bulletin board next to their assembly line:Â ""Long lost distant days/ I don't quite remember you.""Â ""House of Lies""Â could pass for lost late 60s John Lennon demos, unearthed and Martinized into a new shape.Â And let's face it: opening trackÂ ""Harmonia""Â sounds like whatever Jeff Lynne did toÂ ""Free as a Bird""Â for theÂ Beatles Anthology.Â I'm not sure what other sorts of replica sun machines the Shortwave Set have produced in the past, but most of the current album is about as functional and inviting as fluorescent track lighting. But what if, I thought to myself a few times while listening to Replica, the Shortwave Set are totally in on the joke? What if the widgets they've made are self-aware, and fully cognizant that this whole thing is just a big piss-take, like the goofy promo pics Danger Mouse and Cee-Loo took to plug St.Â Elsewhere? At the least, they'd sure like us to think they know exactly what they're doing, or so they carefully telegraph onÂ ""I Know"": ""We make our music always off-key/ It's twisted and it's wrong, some kind of junk symphony.""Â But don't be fooled: Like the careful shopper at the antique store, if you scrape the paint with your thumbnail, you'll find an Oster logo underneath.","Danger Mouse helms this release, whichÂ fetishizes 20th century consumer culture, while adopting the same generic approach toward musical style.

A Ways Away,Tara Jane OâNeil,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ee5e6ef95969320758/1:1/w_160/c3e248d2.jpg,2009-05-06 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12987-a-ways-away/,K,"Since her musical beginning as a bass player in the great Louisville, Ky., indie band Rodan, Tara Jane O'Neil has moved in all manner of directions. During the mid-1990s she formed Retsin, a folk-pop duo with the multi-instrumentalist and poet Cynthia Nelson. Then came The Sonora Pine, where she got her experimental chops in collaboration with former Lungfish guitarist Sean Meadows. This was later followed by a stint in the fantastic progressive metal trio the King Cobra, and her relocation to Portland, where she is now based. In addition to her continuously productive solo career which began with the 2000 full-length Peregrine, O'Neil is also a notable artist who's work has been published in two profoundly lovely books of paintings, Who Takes a Feather [Map] and Wings. Strings. Meridians: A Blighted Bestiary [Yeti]. A Ways Away, O'Neil's fifth solo album and first on the K imprint, draws together her considerable experience as a producer, singer, and songwriter in a fleetingly beautiful 36 minutes that washes over the listener in an introspective haze. There's a characteristic tone that runs through all of her albums-- an elastic guitar reverb that stretches to give a delicate puff to her songs, drums that rarely go beyond a gentle grounding pitter-patter and, of course, the haunting lull of her voice, which beckons the listener into her world with mellow grace. Strings make a valuable appearance on A Ways Away, bringing a sharp sweetness to a song like ""In Tall Grass"" as she layers and harmonizes over her main vocal track. O'Neil also includes a slightly reworked version of ""Howl"", one of the standout songs on her 2004 album, You Sound, Reflect. It benefits from a more powerful but just as moving performance, as the focus is brought to her voice instead of heavy instrumentation and therefore feels right at home among her new material. Since O'Neil is just as open to collaboration on recordings as she notoriously is with her live shows, she rounded up Jana Hunter, violinist Jean Cook, members of Ida, and Osa Atoe of New Bloods for contributions to A Ways Away. Their marks are pleasingly evident here and there, but never derail O'Neil's vision for the album, which moves from a glistening guitar solo on ""Pearl Into Sand"" to an explosive drone on ""The Drowning Electric"", bringing our attention back to her understated and intriguing talents as a guitarist with an extraordinary attention to detail that both soothes and surprises.","Ex-Rodan bassist makes her K Records debut with a new LP thatÂ draws together her considerable experience as a producer, singer, and a songwriter.

I Feel Cream,Peaches,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4009d034d5c69bf2f6f/1:1/w_160/83741a5c.jpg,2009-05-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13003-i-feel-cream/,XL,"Peaches is the sort of artist who is so defined by the fully formed, distinct aesthetic of her debut album that her subsequent releases cannot help but seem like sequels in a film series. As such, her last two records were clear cases of diminishing returns-- Fatherfucker seemed lazy and rushed; Impeach My Bush was better, but inconsistent in its inspiration. Both albums expanded upon the gleefully pervy, button-pushing persona established on The Teaches of Peaches, but broke little ground in their own right, and mostly presented a more extreme and gratingly puerile variation on her brand of sexually confrontational performance art. This was unfortunate, as the raw power of songs like ""Fuck the Pain Away"" and ""Lovertits"" came just as much from their bawdiness as their well-crafted tunefulness and expression of complicated, conflicted emotions. As she drifted toward intellectualized vulgarity, she lost touch with the wounded humanity that made The Teaches of Peaches so engaging. I Feel Cream finds Peaches reversing that trend, and reconnecting with the muse that produced her early classics. At the same time, its songs point in new directions for her aesthetic and offer her a future beyond endless retreads on a tired formula. Though it feels strange to describe an album with such unapologetically filthy lyrics as ""mature,"" the word certainly applies here, and not just in the way Peaches foregrounds and embraces her advancing age in many of the songs. Several tracks delve deep into what Stephen Malkmus might refer to as ""real emotional trash,"" and allow her to reveal a vulnerability that had only been hinted at on previous efforts. ""Talk To Me"", one of the best songs of Peaches' career to date, has her confronting problems with a partner head-on without pulling any punches, and singing her heart out with the aggrieved intensity of Tina Turner. ""Lose You"", the atypically ethereal track that follows in the sequence, flips the mood with her voice taking on a demure affect as she frets about driving her lover away over a low key yet bass-heavy groove. Both cuts cast aside the baggage of the Peaches persona and are better for it, and the variation in vocal technique broadens the range of the record considerably. When Peaches returns to her default position of sexually explicit rapping, her performances are more focused and gracefully composed than in the past, perhaps a direct result of the superior quality beats provided by guest producers Simian Mobile Disco and Digitalism. ""Billionaire"", the record's most overtly hip-hop oriented track, is a genuine banger with rhymes recalling Beck circa Midnite Vultures, and stands out as another all-time high in the Peaches songbook. The remainder of the selections favor a more European approach to keyboard tones and dance beats, which in turn brings her deeper into a modern club sound beyond her origins in electroclash. Intriguingly, the record's final quarter slips into a woozy, down-tempo minimalism that feels sexy as opposed to sexual, and comes across like an update on the freakishly calm funkiness of Missy Elliott and Timbaland's early-00s collaborations. Depsite the number of collaborators on board for I Feel Cream-- Gonzalez, Soulwax, and Drums of Death also contribute-- Peaches still produced the lion's share of the album on her own, and her sensibility as a musician has clearly evolved along with her approach to lyrics. Ultimately, even when she veers into previously unexplored aesthetic territory, every track feels just like Peaches, which is rather remarkable given how rigid and predictable she had been in the recent past. Whereas it was beginning to seem that Peaches' shtick was an artistic dead end, there is now plenty of reason to believe that she may have the skills and vision necessary to produce interesting, emotionally affecting work well beyond menopause.","Electroclash holdover's latest both points to new directions and recalls the strengths displayed onÂ debut LPÂ The Teaches of Peaches.

Not only is Andrews the primary songwriter, frontman, and face of the band (that was his portrait on the cover of 2007's Nux Vomica), but with the group's often spare arrangements and bluesy, sandpapery melodies, it is his keening voice that gives the Veils their emotional wallop. It's a voice that splits the difference between the earnest, reedy wanting of a young, be-mulleted Bono and the anxious bleat of ""Paranoid Android""-era Thom Yorke. Many have used Jeff Buckley as a comparison, but that misses Andrews' best feature. While Buckley's falsetto was so emotive that it could bleed a Leonard Cohen song of its darkness, carving a path for teary American Idol performances, Andrews has a dryness to his delivery, taking what could be poignant and churning it around in his mouth until it comes out wry or arch. It sounds akin to many of rock's greatest voices, but ultimately, because his tongue is often planted far inside his cheek, the final effect is unique, so when he does give in to a moment of sincerity, listeners feel the weight. Though Sun Gangs, Veils' third full-length and second with their current lineup, is missing the spleen that surged throughout Nux Vomica, it offers plenty of other drama for Andrews to vocally interpret. He claims that it's a break-up record, and the lyrics on the surprisingly delicate title track seem to confirm it, even if few of the other tracks are explicitly about romantic loss. For the first time, however, Andrews seems comfortable giving in to the expressive power of his voice. And so the songs with the most earnestly sung, majestic melodies-- like the Bernard Butler-produced, piano-led opener ""Sit Down By the Fire""-- are among the collection's best. Sun Gangs is, unmistakably, an emotional journey, though not always a pleasant one. ""Three Sisters"" and ""The Letter"" offer proof that Andrews is enamored with fellow Antipodean Nick Cave, though not having 30 years of experience like his hero, the tunes start to feel forgettable and overly repetitious in the context of the album. And ""Larkspur"", Sun Gang's emotional centerpiece, is especially difficult to listen to, especially given its more than eight-and-a-half-minute run time. Depending on your mood, it can sound like the purposefully disorienting soundtrack to a nervous breakdown or, with its build and repeated ""I pull his hands from the earth"" mantra, a modern update of the Doors' garbled theatrics of ""The End"". But there is still something compelling about its unpleasantness, how it is so naked and unafraid of being ugly. And fortunately, it comes just two songs after ""The House She Lived In"", Sun Gangs' melodic showstopper. With a vintage vibe and charming lyrics that rhyme ""remember"" with ""December"" against the familiar insistence of doo-wop piano chords, the track's pop charm remains as an aftertaste long enough for listeners to muddle through ""Larkspur""'s often cruel ambiance. Perhaps, then, Sun Gangs is less a break-up record, and more a ""relationship"" record, in that it has the ups and downs of a love affair, with moments of joy, boredom, and viciousness sandwiched in closely next to each other. And while that makes for a challenging and complex listen-- Andrews has certainly proved to be adept at wringing bitterness or misanthropy from bruised melodies-- one can't help but hope that his next relationship is a happy one. For Sun Gangs' biggest surprise is that Andrews sounds lovely sounding lovely.","The third full-length from this emotionally charged UK/New Zealand rock outfit finds frontman Finn Andrews fully realizing the expressive power of his voice.

From Her to Eternity / The First Born Is Dead / Kicking Against the Pricks / Your Funeral... My Trial,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8aabf31b7dc7155af9/1:1/w_160/587833fd.jpg,2009-05-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12949-from-her-to-eternity-the-first-born-is-dead-kicking-against-the-pricks-your-funeral-my-trial/,Mute,"Unlike his predecessors in the fraternal order of wild-child rock'n'roll frontmen, Nick Cave has shown that aging and raging are not mutually exclusive properties. Thirty years into his performing career, Cave's critical stock has arguably never been higher, following the one-two punch of 2007's Grinderman one-off and last year's Bad Seeds return Dig!!! Lazarus, Dig!!! To wit, at similar points in their careers, Mick Jagger and Iggy Pop were stocking used-CD-store bins with the likes of Wandering Spirit andÂ Naughty Little Doggie. Still, it can be difficult to reconcile the diaper-clad zombie doing strange things to billy goats in the ""Nick the Stripper"" video with the stately, sartorially blessed Renaissance man who, over the past decade, has comfortably infiltrated the pop-cultural establishment through acclaimed screenwriting efforts (2006's The Proposition), Kylie Minogue duets, and crooning Beatles songs for Sean Penn Oscar bait (I Am Sam). The 25th-anniversary reissues of his first four solo albums provide a gauzy lens on how Cave went from fronting one of rock's most volatile, destructive bands (The Birthday Party) to one of its most enduring, redoubtable ones, the Bad Seeds. (They also serve as a bittersweet end-of-an-era time capsule, what with the recently announced departure of Cave's long-time foil, Mick Harvey.) However, what you hear over the course of these albums is not the typical, linear trajectory from chaos to control, but a series of sudden reinventions and relapses. Like the temptation-plagued protagonists that figure in his songs, Nick Cave's road to redemption is marked by sharp, sudden detours back into the wild. With Cave and Harvey recruiting Einsturzende Neubauten's Blixa Bargeld, ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and guitarist Hugo Race mere months after the Birthday Party's 1983 demise, the collapsible sound of From Her to Eternity (1984) speaks to the Bad Seeds' hastily assembled origins and fluid instrumental roles. Cave may have be in the throes of an infamous heroin habit that would both fuel and plague him for most of the ensuing decade, but on From Her he sounds like he's in withdrawal from his former band, striving to distance himself from the Birthday Party's junkyard punk, but occasionally reverting to its shrieking hysterics (""Cabin Fever!""). When removed from the context of antagonizing a bar full of pissed-off Birthday Party fans, some of the album's more provocative gestures now feel diffused: While the grim reading Leonard Cohen's ""Avalanche"" sees Cave already aligning himself with pop's legendary outsiders, the black-cloud ambience and gnashed-teeth delivery make it more closely resemble the opening overture to Goth: The Musical! But with the unnerving piano pulse and feedback spasms of ""From Her to Eternity"" and the murderous, militaristic goose-step of ""Saint Huck"", the Bad Seeds refashion the Birthday Party's post-punk splatter into something even more devious and powerful. Here, the band aren't merely providing musical accompaniment to Cave's nightmarish narratives; they're reacting to and manifesting them, favoring space and tactility-- the lacerating scrapes of guitar strings, the tremorous vibrations of piano chords-- over noise-for-noise's-sake. And therein lies the evil genius of the early Bad Seeds: They re-imagined the rock band as foley artists. The opening track to the Bad Seeds' second album, The First Born Is Dead (1985), elevates that cinematic sensibility with the seven-minute, desert-storming thriller ""Tupelo"", a song that, even if Cave had succumbed to his smack habit in the mid-80s, would nonetheless have secured his legend. Where most post-punk/New Pop artists of the day had abandoned contrarian values to embrace concepts of affluence and technological progress, Cave and the Bad Seeds went about digging up the deadest of dead horses: the blues-- a music that, at the time, was being neutered into supper-club smoothness by the likes of Eric Clapton and Robert Cray. But if the back-to-roots tilt of The First Born Is Dead-- the first product of the band's four-year relocation to Berlin-- stands in stark contrast to the future-minded, sample-based pop music of the era, lyrically, ""Tupelo"" is no less a masterful mash-up, weaving a breathless yarn from strands of the Old Testament, the birth of Elvis and John Lee Hooker's ""Tupelo Blues"" (itself a re-imagination of the namesake city's history, casting it as a victim of the 1927 Mississippi River flood that, in reality, had spared it). The First Born Is Dead is never quite so bold again, adopting a more familiar bluesy swing on ""Say Goodbye to the Little Girl Tree"" and last-call piano-bar warbling on ""Knocking on Joe"", and when Cave bellows ""I am the Black Crow King"", you're more likely to picture one of the Lizard variety. But in the ragingÂ reappropriationÂ of Bob Dylan's ""Wanted Man"", The First Born Is Dead feels like less of a genre exercise andÂ more a distillation of the philosophyÂ Cave would pursue for years to come-- i.e., when it comes to search-and-destroy deviance, punk rock's got nothing on wild-west outlaw history, old blues songs and the Bible. If the Dylan covers and Hooker references hadn't already established Cave's old-soul aspirations, for his next move, he opted for a strategy that most aged entertainers resort to when trying to revive their careers three decades in, let alone three albums: the all-covers collection. In a sense, what Cave attempted with Kicking Against the Pricks (1986) was not all that different than what any one of us do when we hit a karaoke bar: Push ourselves out of our comfort zones and have a bit of a laugh while doing so-- certainly, the Bad Seeds have never sounded more cheerful than in the sloshed group sing-along of the Velvets' ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" and the cheeky, cowpoke reading of country ballad ""Long Black Veil"". But while stacked with murder ballads that fit right into Cave's wheelhouse -- ""Hey Joe"", Hooker's ""I'm Gonna Kill That Woman""â what's most remarkable about the album is the amount of conviction Cave invests in his more schmaltzy selections. Rather than subject AM radio golden-oldies like Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", Tom Jones' ""Weeping Annaleah"", and Gene Pitney's ""Something's Gotten a Hold of My Heart"" to contemptuous desecration, Cave sounds determined to use them as vehicles to make him a better singer, and the Bad Seeds a more sophisticated, stylistically diverse band. Their next album would yield the real fruits of the Pricks experiment: Your Funeral... My Trial (1986) showcases Cave and the Bad Seeds' various modes and models with peak-form precision, building up from the elegantly wasted reveries (""Sad Waters"", ""Stranger Than Kindess""), creepy cabaret set pieces (""The Carny"") and exquisite murder balladry (the title track) of the album's first act before erupting into the show-stopping, whip-cracking surges (""Jack's Shadow"", ""She Fell Away"", a definitive cover of Tim Rose's ""Long Time Man"") of the second. Every guise Nick Cave would assume from hereon in-- from the dignified piano balladeer of 1990's The Good Son to the mad preacher of 2004's Abattoir Blues-- can be traced back here; indeed, even Grinderman's unhinged ""No Pussy Blues"" seems a touch less feral once you get reacquainted with the blasphemous depravity of Your Funeral's ""Hard on for Love"", which intensifies its libidinous thrust into rabid bloodlust and then abruptly cuts out when Cave hits his frothy-mouthed fever pitch. The Bad Seeds' final Berlin-based recording-- 1988's Tender Prey, featuring certified Cave classics ""The Mercy Seat"" and ""Deanna""-- is not a part of this initial remaster series, presumably so Mute could reissue the band's eight releases for the label in even blocks of four. However, its exclusion also underscores the notion that Your Funeral... My Tria**l represents the true apotheosis of the Bad Seeds, drawing from the strengths of its three quite different predecessors-- the horror-film atmosphere of From Her to Eternity, the apocalyptic oration of The First Born Is Dead, the velvet-jacket suavity of Kicking Against the Pricks-- into a superbly structured, singular work. Every bruised romantic to emerge in its wake-- from PJ Harvey to the Tindersticks, Mark Lanegan to the National-- owes it a tip of the syringe. The timeless quality of Cave's songwriting sources, and the live-in-the-room ethos employed by producer Flood mean that these albums have aged infinitely better than most bands' mid-80s output, bearing none of the technical sheen, studio gimmickry and drum compression that dates so many records of the era. But these remasters are still worthy additions for both long-time enthusiasts and recent, post-Grinderman recruits. On top of revising the tracklists to their original vinyl running orders (the old North American CD versions bizarrely interspersed B-sides into the flow mid-album), the new mixes render the Bad Seeds' mise en scenes even more nightmarishly vivid-- on From Her to Eternity's chain-gang howl ""Well of Misery"", Harvey's percussive hits really do sound like hammers hitting rock, while the multi-tracked madness of Your Funeral's ""The Carny"" is about as close as you'll get to having Cave read you a scary bedtime story in your room. The four issues are sold separately but, in a clever gambit to make you buy all four, the discs are each appended with sequential portions of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's accompanying DVD documentary, titled Do You Love Me. The films are strikingly simple, comprised entirely of uniformly barren, head-shot interviews with members of the Bad Seeds (Bargeld, Adamson), their peers (Go-Between Robert Vickers, former Birthday Party guitarist Roland S. Howard), celebrity admirers (Moby, Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner), critics (Simon Reynolds) as well as regular fans, including, most memorably, a stripper from L.A. who-- at height of Guns N Roses' late-80s peeler-bar dominance-- insisted on dancing to Cave's version of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"". But beyond the revelatory anecdotes about each album's recording-- heck, I could watch Blixa Bargeld read out department-store catalogues--Â the documentaries show that, for all of his songs' grandiose theatricality, Cave's music affects his fans (famous and otherwise) on the same deeply personal, intimate level. Fittingly, pretty much the only principal not interviewed about Cave is Cave himself-- because, like their subject, the filmmakers respect the distance between those who tell the myth and those who make it.","Band's first four albums are given expanded reissues.

Technicolor Health,Harlem Shakes,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fbb1335d7bf169885b/1:1/w_160/44b80e48.jpg,2009-05-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12999-technicolor-health/,Gigantic,"The cover of Technicolor Health, the debut full-length from New York's Harlem Shakes, depicts a rainbow over a desolate city street in a serious state of disrepair. Power lines wilt, trees teeter, telephone poles tilt, and chunks of broken down buildings spill onto the sidewalks. But has the rainbow beam come to the rescue, or is it responsible for the destruction?Â No doubt the Shakes, with their brand ofÂ today'sÂ fashionable guitar pop sounds-- a fusion of folk, global-pop, and good ol' fashioned indie rock-- mean to project the former interpretation. The music exudes a kind of clear-eyed optimism that can only come from seeing the worst but looking forward to the best, and indeed the band has acknowledged hearkening back to the hearty, happy (or at least happier) days of the early 1990s, not in terms of the music but in terms of the national everything-is-still-possible mood. On the other hand, anyone put off by the group's privileged nostalgia and self-consciously upbeat lyrics might imagine the cover's rainbow canopy as a multi-hued harbinger of doom, announcing yet another smug Brooklyn band with a savvy appreciation of someone's big brother's hip record collection and a smart way of appropriating and assimilating it into a catchy enough but far from guileless confection. Surely it takes some degree of suspension of disbelief to buy ""Sunlight"", the band's doe-eyed tribute to having a good time, draped as it is with bright keyboards and horns, or ""Strictly Game"", which bounces along bubbling synths and Afro-Caribbean rhythms, singer Lexy Benaim declaring hopefully, in his thin, nasally but affable voice, ""this will be a better year."" Indeed, were Benaim a stronger singer, he might better understand the importance of serving a little darkness with your light, some subtle irony undercutting the earnestness. But no, he and the Shakes don't even attempt the balancing act and instead stress the pep, which is probably for the best, since an act with any less conviction that the bright way is the right way would have a hard time pulling off the likes of ""Unhurried Hearts (Passaic Pastoral)""-- let alone its title-- or ""Natural Man"", each a broad compression of the recent indie-timeline beginning somewhere around Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and ending more or less contemporaneously with Vampire Weekend. Fortunately, even if the band's lack of cynicism often veers to the opposite extreme, the Harlem Shakes' handshake-and-smile approach is hard to outright dislike. The Harlem Shakes have their eyes on the prize, and it's sort of charming imagining the group riding that rainbow to the rescue (and greater fame) as self-appointed countermeasures to the menace of malaise. Sunny proselytizers that that they are, the Shakes no doubt see every frown and rain cloud as mere challenges to surmount until the masses are basking in their collective light, but on their door-to-door home-invasion quest they should expect more than a few grouchy ""no solicitors"" postings. This one included.","New York's Harlem Shakes offer a take on today'sÂ fashionable guitar sounds-- a fusion of folk, global-pop, and good ol' fashioned indie rock.

Coming From Reality,Rodriguez,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f55e6ef9596932076a/1:1/w_160/b979dd61.jpg,2009-05-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12994-coming-from-reality/,Light in the Attic,"""I've played every kind of gig there is to play now,"" intones Sixto Rodriguez on the track ""A Most Disgusting Song"". ""I've played faggot bars, hooker bars, motorcycle funerals... in opera houses, concert halls, halfway houses."" Not sure where opening up for Animal Collective in Chicago this past January ranks on that list, but it's a safe bet his booking agent has a bit more pull these days. The once-obscure Detroit singer-songwriter is enjoying a reissue-fueled second chapter in his career-- third, if you count his cult status in Australia and South Africa-- and is finally receiving critical reception a few decades after the fact. Not bad for someone once billed under the silly pseudonym Rod Riguez because a producer/label owner ""didn't want to take a chance"" that his artist would be pigeonholed by the public. A big part of his appeal is his urban poet-style social observations, frank lyrics laid bluntly over folk-rock strumming, funky riffs, and intriguing instrumentation. Coming From Reality, originally released in 1971 and the follow-up to Cold Fact, loses some of the grittiness and directness of his debut, never striking the same balance of eclectic arrangements, reverb-heavy vocals and flourishes achieved while working with the production team of Detroit vets Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore. Washed out a bit by soft, sometimes airy strings and lacking a killer single like the drug dealer-themed ""Sugar Man"", it doesn't hit quite as hard. But it's a decent addition to the singer's relatively scant output. Recorded in London with producer Steve Rowland, a former Hollywood actor who would later discover and sign the Cure, Coming From Reality suffered from the change in studio and scenery. Opener ""Climb Up on My Music"" is a mellow, organ-heavy Steppenwolf/Santana jam with a screaming guitar riff and ""Halfway Up the Stairs"" exudes a sweet, cheesy 70s soft rock vibe. Rodriguez still delivers some pointed observations on tracks like ""Street Boy"", one of a trio of solid bonus cuts recorded in 1972-1973 with Coffey and Theodore, and ""A Most Disgusting Song"", a droll, overly long country-tinged narration told from the vantage point of a dive bar. But they're thinned out by songs like ""It Started Out So Nice"", a string-laden tale filled with some obscure myth-like references, and ""Heikki's Suburbia Bus Tour"", a rip on suburban life with an awkward chorus and a tired dig on lawn care. On the plaintive ""I Think of You"", his voice leans too much towards James Taylor softness, and lyrics like ""Baby I ain't joking/ And it's not what I'm smoking/ But I really think you're nice"" from ""Silver Words?"" which sounds like a tired Seth Rogen come-on, are a bit weak. When Rodriguez's pastiche of styles coalesces, the music occupies an interesting niche at the crossroads of late-60s/early-70s music. But the second trip to the archives is a case of diminishing returns.","This once-forgotten Detroit singer-songwriter mellows out on his second reissued album.

The Snake,Wildbirds & Peacedrums,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3bdea9e61561daa4d4f/1:1/w_160/631f2c6a.jpg,2009-05-05 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12943-the-snake/,Leaf,"It's only been a year since Wildbirds & Peacedrums released their debut album, Heartcore, and were praised for their application of deceptively simple techniques to create highly complex and agile pop music. The Swedish duo, comprising vocalist Mariam Wallentin and her husband, percussionist Andreas Werliin, have taken this unadorned method to a remarkable level on their follow up album, The Snake. Heartcore may have shone with clarity and technical artfulness, but in the passing year Wildbirds & Peacedrums have honed their skills to such a fine degree that their distinctive sound is now fully realized and acutely powerful. The Snake is a considerably darker album compared to the tender playfulness of their debut, and this smoky sultriness suits the music well. Just as the number of cuts on a diamond determine its brightness, Wildbirds & Peacedrums seem to have absorbed a huge range of musical resources-- from American primitive to jazz to BjÃ¶rkesque experimentalism and even Mongolian throat singing-- and mined them carefully before whittling down the essentials and fashioning 10 beautifully imaginative, contemplative songs. The Snake comes alive through its imagery, which provides the life source for the instrumentation to be structured around. The opening track, ""Island"", recalls the journey of a solitary man who swims to Iceland under a canopy of rainbows, and on ""Chain of Steel"", Wallentin struggles to free herself from the emotional clutches of a female foe. All this deft wordplay makes for some fantastic lyrics, but the real magic lies in their execution. Wallentin hops and skips across her vocal landscape with full control and arresting finesse, demanding that you listen intently to her abstract storytelling. On a track such as ""So Soft So Pink"" she travels between vocal styles fluidly, from the aforementioned throat singing that blends in with the springy rasp of a Jew's harp before sliding in to soaring, ethereal melodies as she constantly alters her technique to enable the song to expand. It's barely six minutes long, but it feels epic. The way her soulful vocals maneuver across Werliin's percussive background recalls the dark beauty of Nina Simone's ""Be My Husband"" or Odetta's ""Another Man Done Gone"", which are all the more compelling for the warmth and passion that knot around the skeletal simplicity of the music. Werliin's sharpness and dexterity is the key to making this work: His rhythmic sophistication is the group's vital glue, and each member depends on the other to reach their full potential. As Wallentin sings on the final track, ""My Heart"", ""I'm lost without your rhythm."" Despite their strong pop leanings, its not surprising that Wildbirds & Peacedrums were awarded Swedish Jazz Act of the Year in 2008. Their equipment may be largely restricted to percussion, vocals, and the occasional embellishment of keyboard, but their ability to fully eclipse these limitations and create music with a strong improvisational pulse and so much vitality is a no small feat, and proves that they are continuing to experiment in magnificent, dynamic ways.","Swedish two-piece, whose music consists mostly of voice and percussion, continues to push its skeletal set-up into intriguing new realms.

Enter the Vaselines,The Vaselines,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f0ea9e61561daa4db8/1:1/w_160/74b3547a.jpg,2009-05-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12989-enter-the-vaselines/,Sub Pop,"Famous superfans are both a blessing and a curse-- just ask the Vaselines. In 1992, at the urging of ardent admirer Kurt Cobain, Sub Pop released The Way of the Vaselines, a compilation of the short-lived and then-little-known band's extant recordings (a whopping 19 tracks). Hooray for them, right? Maybe. If the Vaselines originally slotted neatly into the mid-to-late 80s Scottish shambolic pop underground of the Pastels, Shop Assistants, and BMX Bandits, their origins-- and the band's actual recordings-- became overshadowed by a single factoid: They influenced Nirvana. Nirvana's (good-intentioned, I'm sure) covers of ""Molly's Lips"" and ""Son of a Gun"" were more-or-less faithful, bouncy renditions, but they lacked the humor, menace, and complexity of the naÃ¯vely played, ambivalently sung originals. And ""Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam"" has long been associated with Nirvana's funereal MTV Unplugged performance, during which Cobain caressed the sweetly sacrilegious song with the reverence due a cultural relic-- something it neither wanted nor deserved. Sub Pop's new Enter the Vaselines 2xCD set of remastered originals and unreleased demos and live tracks gives listeners, now adequately distanced from Cobain's influence, an opportunity to reevaluate the band on its own terms. In his liner notes, journalist and eternal scenester Everett True, batting around words like ""sordidness"" and ""depravity"" and painting core duo Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee as subversive artistes, probably overcorrects the Vaselines story. The slipcase's cover photo, featuring a glowering McKee and listless, stoned-looking Kelly, does an ace job of reinforcing this view, even as the set's musical contents tell a different tale. As the former romantic couple has repeatedly asserted in interviews (including one conducted for inclusion in the set by Pastel Stephen McRobbie), the band was originally a lark, and many of their songs were written for a laugh by horny but essentially pretty wholesome kids with time on their hands. Early tracks-- ""Rory Rides Me Raw"", with its charmingly awful double entendres, and Divine cover ""You Think You're a Man"" with its juvenile, erm,Â climactic ending-- succinctly make that case. (They never abandoned the sexually provocative, however, going on to record songs like ""Monsterpussy"" and ""The Day I Was a Horse"".) The Vaselines became a little more accomplished and professional over the course of their short run, ditching their drum machine for flesh-and-blood bandmates and investing greater effort, including actual guitar solos and orchestral arrangements (okay, ""Sunbeam"" has a viola), into their second EP, Dying for It, and only full-length, Dum-Dum. But as this career survey suggests, the band was at its best when they were at their worst, when they sounded like rank amateurs in the throes of DIY fever-- not to mention, love. Kelly and McKee's chemistry, their playful vocal trade-offs, and flirtatious innuendo are what make a song like ""Gun"" something more than anonymous C86 ephemera. And make them hard to cover well. With their dirty mouths and pretty faces, pop perspicacity and knack for making a bloody racket, there's no question the Vaselines were worth rescuing from obscurity. And now that the original duo is touring for the first time in 20 years-- without any new product-- Sub Pop's compilation redux is, from a marketing perspective, understandable. Whether fans who already own the first Sub Pop compilation (which is still in print and less expensive) need to cough up cash for this second release isn't as clear. The 17-track bonus disc is fun to hear, particularly the demos for the unreleased ""Rosary Job"" and ""Red Poppy"", but it's hardly a game-changer. And considering the Vaselines' studio recordings were almost as fuzzy and slipshod as their demos and live tracks, the audio fidelity upgrade, while nice to have, probably won't sway the lo-fi-loving hardcores, nor should it.","Sub Pop's newÂ 2xCD set of remastered originals and extras gives listeners an opportunity to reevaluate thisÂ Kurt Cobain-lovedÂ band on its own terms.

Actor,St. Vincent,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ec13d1975652138bc6/1:1/w_160/8b2869f2.jpg,2009-05-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12985-actor/,4AD,"Annie Clark, the musician otherwise known as St. Vincent, projects an aura of eerie perfection-- beautiful, poised, good-humored, and well-adjusted to a degree uncommon for rock performers, let alone ordinary people. She's clearly not oblivious to her disarming qualities. On the covers of both her albums, her wide eyes and porcelain features give her the appearance of a cartoon princess come to life, and in the songs contained therein, she sings with the measured, patient tones of a benevolent, maternal authority figure. The thing that separates Clark from any number of earth mother Lilith Fair types, however, is her eagerness to subvert that effect. Her album covers may showcase her pretty face, but her blank expression and the tight framing leave the images feeling uncomfortably ambiguous. Her voice and arrangements are often mellow and soothing, but those sounds mainly serve as context as she exposes undercurrents of anxiety and discomfort hidden just beneath a gorgeous faÃ§ade. The songs on St. Vincent's second album, Actor, are primarily sung from the perspective of women who feel stifled and restless in their safe, orderly lives. Her characters worry about the judgment of neighbors and strangers, struggle with boredom and complacency, attempt to sublimate or defuse their anger, and, in one of the record's darkest selections, fantasize about disappearing completely into a new identity. Her lyrics are sympathetic observations rendered with clear, economical language focused on a specific moment of conflict or epiphany, occasionally undercut with self-deprecating asides and subtle humor. Even when the music is at its most dramatic, as when songs slip out of placid, Disney-esque string accompaniment into jagged, distorted guitar passages, Clark consistently understates her characters' angst, and buries their negative emotions under layers of denial, stoicism, and subservience to the desire of others. The sound of the recordings depict the nuances of these deliberately muted emotions with uncanny accuracy, but the result is not overly polite or unaffecting. On the contrary, Clark's compositions hone in on precise fluctuations in mood, and flesh out complex inner worlds for the women suggested in her lyrics. At some points, as in the climax of ""Black Rainbow"" and the groovy, robotic hysteria of ""Marrow"", she achieves a harrowing expression of panic and desperation, but she does just as well in conveying the tension and pressures within less bombastic numbers such as ""The Bed"" and ""Save Me From What I Want"". The latter, which takes its title from one of artist Jenny Holzer's best-known aphorisms, is particularly successful in the way its faintest textural details communicate an unease at odds with its airy tone and steady beat. Since Clark's voice seldom strays from a calm, lovely tone, her guitar parts articulate much of the record's anxieties and provide its moments of cathartic release. Her style is melodic and controlled, conjuring abrasive textures that nevertheless have a clean, meticulous quality that complements her immaculate arrangements as well as her characters' temperate demeanor. Despite a reliance on processed tonality, she manages to avoid a sterile coldness, and has a way of performing her most tightly composed hooks with a touch of looseness and immediacy. In her heaviest, most warped riffs, Clark finds the grace in her subjects' frustration and purges their fear and repressed anger with a glorious, singular noise. In ""Actor Out of Work"", an atypically straightforward rock song early in the album's sequence, Clark uses the title phrase as a sad epithet for an inappropriate yet attractive suitor with an inability to lie convincingly. Acting, of course, is a lot more than just lying and pretending. It's about inhabiting characters, being able to fill in subtext with cadence and gesture, and having the empathy required to understand the motivations and actions of the person being portrayed. With that in mind, the album is perfectly titled, as Actor proves St. Vincent as an artist capable of crafting believable, complicated characters with compassion, insight, and exacting skill.","This fine second album from Annie Clark's project finds the one-time member of Sufjan's band sharpening her songwriting and expanding her arrangements.

More,Double Dagger,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d4ea9e61561daa4d7f/1:1/w_160/2d33e2db.jpg,2009-05-04 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12960-more/,Thrill Jockey,"After three albums, it's admirable how Baltimore's Double Dagger have steadfastly adhered to their spartan three-man setup of drums, bass, and vocals, continuing to search for nuance in minimalism via punk rock. With a title slightly more clever than III would have been, it's no surprise that More sounds pretty similar to their previous two albums, but that nuance is there; even when the band stretches out or gets their friends in on the action, it takes three or four listens to even notice what they've added. For reasons that seem slightly insane, the album was recorded in an abandoned office floor in the dead of winter-- without heat-- affording the band time to fuss over the precise muffling of a bass drum or momentary squall of feedback; in short, it sounds cheap, but also full. It pays off: Even with the occasional backup vocal or surreptitious extra instrument sneaking into the mix, More feels looser than its predecessor (2007's Ragged Rubble) while being a bit more ambitious. Like everything with Double Dagger-- from their minimal setup to their thoughtful-yet-plainspoken lyrics to the graphic design-- you can tell they've thought it through a few times over. Some of the album's most memorable riffs don't come until minutes into the songs, which build on themselves simply but unexpectedly. The monotonous punk screamer ""No Allies"" becomes sneakily melodic, while the placid intro of ""Vivre Sans Tempt Mort"", with clean plucking and a buzzing harmonium, leads into a blisteringly dynamic anthem, giving singer Nolen Strals time to shout about death and paranoia between the intermittent low-end crunch. Even the six-minute runtime of ""Half-Life"" hides the album's most affecting moment of cautious, weary optimism in its latter half (""maybe this year won't be like the rest,"" Strals sings). These songs are squeezed for variety, from the umpteenth-notes of ""We Are the Ones"" to the straightforward shake and shimmy of ""Camouflage"", or the grinning subterranean chug of ""Surrealist Composition With Your Face"". The sober talk-sing of the verses in ""The Lie/The Truth"" is offset by the triumphant bellow of Sam Herring (of Future Islands) on the chorus; his contribution is slight but essential. Being neither a ""new"" lo-fi act nor a day-glo Wham City band (but able to hang with either), while staying politically aware and personally grounded in their lyrics, Double Dagger once again prove there are fertile ideas in the narrowest slice of middle ground.","Baltimore's Double Dagger are continuing to search for nuance in minimalism via punk rock.

Outside Love,Pink Mountaintops,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39ac0084474cd0c02d9/1:1/w_160/4d83ac2b.jpg,2009-05-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12918-outside-love/,Jagjaguwar,"Vancouver's Stephen McBean may be better known as the principal songwriter and frontman for the gritty psych outfit Black Mountain, but he also leads that group's gentler counterpart, Pink Mountaintops. Though Pink Mountaintops was originally conceived as a solo project, McBean clearly thrives in a collaborative environment. The project's third album, Outside Love, features input from an impressive cast of indie rock staples such as Sophie Trudeau of Godspeed You! Black Emperor/A Silver Mt. Zion, the Sweet Hereafter's Jesse Sykes, Josh Stevenson of Jackie O Motherfucker, and his longtime creative collaborator, Amber Webber of Black Mountain and Lightning Dust. Although Pink Mountaintops were temporarily put on the back burner after the success of Black Mountain's self-titled sophomore album in 2005, McBean resurrected the group the following year with the release of Axis of Evol, on which he continued to explore his deep-rooted love of dark psychedelia with minimalist rhythmic patterns and spidery, hazy, lo-fi guitar. With Outside Love, McBean takes this theme on an adventurous journey to surprising heights, and the fully realized sound allows his ideas more room to breathe. The granular spaciousness of the production, when paired with intentionally sloppy drums and chiming guitars, imparts an atmospheric, almost gothic feel. This works beautifully on the Mazzy Star-esque ""While You Were Dreaming"" and on the outstanding opening track, ""Axis: Thrones of Love"", which expands with lackadaisical smokiness as a rinse of reverb settles like morning mist over the male-female co-sung chorus. Despite the cloudy threads that crisscross through every song, Outside Love throws out some supremely positive vibes. On ""Holiday"", McBean declares that everyone he knows deserves a vacation in the sun ""until the lions are off of their backs"", and ""The Gayest of Sunbeams"" is a shambolic, joyous romp built on uptempo chord shifts and group vocals that burn with enthusiasm. But it takes multiple listens to uncover the complexity of Outside Love; despite its deceptively simple architecture, it's grounded by rich stylistic flickering. The folky ambiance of ""And I Thank You"" could have slipped out of Bill Callahan's back catalogue, while the string section that hangs in the background of ""Vampire"" has a discreet but haunting presence, like cobwebs diffusing light through a window. This kind of agile songwriting shows that Pink Mountaintops' substance lies not only in what they show, but in what they choose to hide; here on Outside Love, they move between shadows and light until the form is revealed.","Side project of Black Mountain's Stephen McBean this time includes contributions from members of Godspeed You!

Help,Thee Oh Sees,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3eaea9e61561daa4da6/1:1/w_160/e355ce17.jpg,2009-05-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12981-help/,In the Red,"When we had to go to the record store to get music, I liked buying albums I knew nothing about based only on their cover art. There was something exciting to me about rolling the dice on a band after simply connecting with their visual aesthetic. Of course, that kind of mystery doesn't exist anymore-- we could feasibly know loads about a group before hearing a note of their music-- but if it did, I think I would take one look at the hand-drawn purple bat and rainbow adorning Thee Oh Sees' Help and just know it was going to be rad. And I would be right. For those who haven't been following John Dwyer's various costume changes over the years, Thee Oh Sees are an extension of the San Francisco-based rocker's work as OCS, a lo-fi solo folk project he started after heading up (among others) the raucous noise and garage acts Pink and Brown and Coachwhips. Over time the band's expanded into a four-piece, and Dwyer's used it as a means to explore his deep love of 1960s psychedelic and garage rock. It's also been an avenue for him to try out more conventional pop songs with deeper accessibility-- 2008's mostly underappreciated The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In found Dwyer at his most listenable to date. Help isn't so much a departure from Master's Bedroom but a refinement of what Thee Oh Sees accomplished on that record. Their approach is the same-- a combination of the Cramps' zombie rockabilly with the rumble of the 60s underground-- but everything about this album is tighter and more focused. Gone are the detours into funereal dirges, the patches of spaz-noise, and the momentary freakouts. Here you've got just 12 very good rock songs without an ounce of fat on them. Perhaps more remarkable is that, in this effort to streamline, Thee Oh Sees haven't lost their signature volatility-- Help still seems like it could careen off the rails at any moment (a good thing). With an album this retro-minded, there's a desire to pick apart all its myriad influences, and indeed, I could spend my entire word count investigating nods to the Small Faces, 13th Floor Elevators, the Troggs, and others, but that would be missing the point. The important thing here is that Thee Oh Sees incorporate the oft-referenced Nuggets stuff in a way that feels reverential. With grinding guitars and bah-bah-bah vocals, tracks like ""Meat Step Lively"" and ""Go Meet the Seed"" owe everything to this style, but with the punk and new-wave elements also at play, they don't feel trite or plagiarized. Even if they did, these guys sound so much more authentic than almost anyone else doing this kind of thing that one wonders if it would matter. As he did on Master's Bedroom, Dwyer splits vocal duties here with bandmate Brigid Dawson and it's this one-two punch that really makes the record sing. On devilish stompers ""Destroyed Fortress Reappears"" and ""Ruby Go Home"", her soft croon cuts the acidity of Dwyer's yelp and lends the tracks buoyancy. It's a give-and-take not unlike the Mamas and the Papas' or the B-52s', and even though the band is the first to point out they don't sound like the latter, the comparison is apt. The male/female vocal interplay bleeds into Help's slower tracks and works there, too. Dwyer and Dawson meet in the chorus of gritty love ballad ""A Flag in the Court"" and beautifully double-track the brooding, dirty groove of ""Can You See?"" These tracks and other winners such as ""Rainbow"" and ""Soda St. #1"" comprise an album that's virtually mistake-free. It's hard to pick out a song, or even aspects of a song, that don't work within the overall context of the record. That's not to say that everyone will love it. In the end it's a niche piece, and if you don't have an appreciation for the music Thee Oh Sees are drawing upon, it's safe to say this won't be your thing. But if you're a lifelong garage-rock purist or just enjoy the occasional Jay Reatard track, there's a good chance you'll get a lot of mileage out of Help. It's hard not to: This is like meat and potatoes prepared by a master chef-- totally familiar but utterly delicious.","San Fran fixtureÂ John Dwyer continues to successfully useÂ Thee Oh Sees toÂ explore his deep love of 1960s psychedelic and garage rock.

Invisible Cities,NOMO,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3bfea9e61561daa4d56/1:1/w_160/530db377.jpg,2009-05-04 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12945-invisible-cities/,Ubiquity,"On last year's Ghost Rock, NOMOÂ  established their own brand of future funk, built on hypnotic grooves comprised of drums and a huge collection of electrified, homemade likembes and scrap metal. The horn section, once the thundering heart of the band, took on a different role, settling into spaced-out dialogue with the rhythms-- leader Elliot Bergman's more conversational horn charts recalled Charles Mingus and Sun Ra in their perfectly pitched balance between structure and disorder. Invisible Cities serves as something of a breath-catching moment for a band that's taken a giant leap on each of its albums, bringing some of the thunder back while further elaborating on the progress made on Ghost Rock. Bergman's scrap metal instrument collection continues to grow-- this time, he's made a musical contraption out of street sweeper tines to deepen the band's gamelan-ish percussion patterns even further. The band also pays tribute to one of the 20th century's great instrument inventors, Moondog, by covering his German-period composition ""Bumbo"", a perfect fit for NOMO's mix of complex rhythm, homemade sounds, and arrangements that allow individual horns a chance to break out of the group. They add wordless female voices to the mix on the weird, rambling ""Ma"", giving the song a striking avant-exotica sound as the nagging guitar part chafes at the snaking baritone sax line. Amid cosmic freakouts like the echoing rocket ride ""Banners on High"" and oozing slow-burns like the smeared half-free/half-composed ""Elijah"", NOMO bring out a few big, crunching horn themes that recall their early, Afrobeat-inspired music. The title track is a total bomb, with the electric likembes providing a bubbling harmonic bed for the horns to lie on over the fractured drum beat. ""Waiting"" is a classic funk workout with fluid sax parts and a few wicked sections where the horns solo against each other, while ""Patterns"" rides a swamp vamp the Meters would've loved to call their own. Invisible Cities is the exact record NOMO needed to make at the point in their evolution. It consolidates all their gains and nicely sums up their output to this point, and as much as you can point to influences and basic kinship with other artists, the music NOMO are now making is very much their own thing. NOMO's facility with both rhythm and tunefulness also makes it easy to follow them as they head down their own path. If you've come this far with the group, Invisible Cities won't disappoint, and it's also a pretty great place to start.","Serving as something of a breath-catching release for this restless band, Invisible Cities nicely sums up its mix of Afrobeat and future funk.

Outer South,Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f3c0084474cd0c03b1/1:1/w_160/5d7c3787.jpg,2009-05-04 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12992-outer-south/,Merge,"Of all the good and not-so-good qualities you can ascribe to Conor Oberst, ""ensemble player"" isn't one of them. It's not just that his work as Bright Eyes has essentially always been a solo vision, but that he felt the need to name it ""Bright Eyes"" in the first place, using a collective nom de plume, in the process adding an extra level of presumptive self-sustaining wholeness. More to the point, there's Oberst's artistic persona itself-- his aggrieved yelp, his poetic bloodletting, his political hectoring, and his perpetual navel gaze, which have combined to attract admirers and detractors with equal fervency. To date, there's not been a whole lot of room for anyone else in Bright Eyes' music, both in the way Oberst sang and in the first-person singular pronouns that so automatically rolled off his tongue. Then came last year's eponymous release under Oberst's actual legal name, and irony of ironies, it turned out to be the most self-effacing, song-driven work of his entire career. Oberst made the album with a newly assembled cadre of players dubbed the Mystic Valley Band, yet it was still solely his name and mug on the cover and almost exclusively his voice and songs on the CD. Which is why it's still hard not to do a double-take upon viewing the credits for Outer South, already tellingly released under the banner of Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, and seeing that a full seven of the album's 16 songs aren't sung by indie-rock's former enfant terrible, and that six of those seven weren't penned by him either. However, Oberst hasn't displayed any modesty within the songs he did write and sing. A full subsuming of Oberst's personality would severely dilute his music's power, but Outer South seems to actually undo many of the beneficially humbling gains made by his last record. Unquestionably, there are dazzlers here, foremost the ripping power-popper ""Cabbage Town"" and the equally pleasing, jangly ""Spoiled"", which cannily evokes the ramshackle charm of 1980s R.E.M. and the Cure. Another plus, ""To All the Lights in the Windows"" gets over on a facile, open-hearted refrain in spite of Oberst's lyrical attempts to bite off more history and myth than he can chew. Unfortunately, that last qualifier also applies to a few of Oberst's other efforts on Outer South. First single ""Nikorette"" finds him engaged in one of his regrettably favorite sports-- passing self-satisfied judgments on his fellow man, pronouncing, ""There's nothing sadder than a lynching mob/ Full of rational men who believe in God."" ""Ten Women"" and ""White Shoes"" are stultifyingly ponderous, and of Oberst's songs of sober fervor only ""Roosevelt Room"" hits its mark, with Oberst remembering his great Desaparecidos trick of replacing Deep Thoughts with pure bile, flashing admirable oppositional rancor at a time when lots of his left-leaning friends are lining up to kiss Obama's hem. Of course, then ""I Found a Reason #2"" arrives and we have to deal with Oberst eating up the old 60s tropes all over again, from evoking Rolling Stone to nakedly aspiring to be the next Dylan, pealing organs and all. And remember, these things are taking place on an album that features songwriting and singing contributions from people not named Conor Oberst. As you might expect, Oberst's reversion to logorrhea and emotional extremism here effectively eliminates the possibility that Outer South will possess any ensemble cohesion. There aren't too many personalities with the panache to butt into Oberst's spotlight, and yet his co-conspirators here seem inherently milquetoast-y regardless of context. Jason Boesel (""Difference Is Time"", ""Eagle on a Pole"") does boast a pleasantly dusky, Matt Berninger-ish croon, but Nik Freitas and especially Taylor Hollingsworth only have reedy nice-boy whines to lend to their tunes. Perhaps it's partly a factor of Oberst's essential attention-grabbing nature, but none of these gentlemen offers up a composition that snags the ear better than the most mundane effort from their fearless leader. Perhaps it's simply the case that Oberst is on a busman's holiday here, but either he failed to get the memo to keep things light, or else he should have recruited some more substantial Wilburys.","Working as a true ensemble player, Conor Oberst here cedes songwriting and vocal duties to others on a sizable portion of his new LP.

Remind Me Where the Light Is,Great Northern,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c9ea9e61561daa4d6e/1:1/w_160/08f9d660.jpg,2009-05-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12952-remind-me-where-the-light-is/,Eenie Meenie,"Ideally for a band, getting a song played in a commercial or during a TV show or film shouldn't merely be a means of putting money in its pockets. There's always the concurrent hope that people will be so moved, turned on, or at least intrigued by the song that they'll hunt down the tune and artist. We've all done it-- memorize a snatch of the lyrics and then either hit up Google or consult the sage minds who respond to queries at Yahoo! Answers (you might even find out how to drywall while you're at it). The L.A.-based electro-rock act Great Northern (ironically a pretty Google-unfriendly moniker) make the kind of music that just happens to be perfect for selling things or setting scenes. Unsurprisingly, the band's first album performed both feats, placing songs in ads as well as on both the big and small screens-- ""Low Is a Height"" even soundtracked a couple of really awesome NBA commercials a year ago that utilized a split-screen gimmick to depict a pair of star hoopsters discussing the importance of the upcoming playoffs. The bad news is that as a roundball junkie I saw these commercials dozens of times, and yet not only was I never once inspired to track down the ad's tune, even listening to it now I can't place it in my memory in conjunction with that commercial. Meanwhile (and I know this is cheating since I already knew and loved the song), I remember somewhat embarrassingly getting a little choked up by the spot where Steve Nash was talking over Radiohead's ""House of Cards"" (ah, Stevie, will you ever get that ring?). Great Northern's sophomore full-length, Remind Me Where the Light Is, should pick right up where the debut left off in terms of scoring network and celluloid placement, while failing to do much to actually compel people to find out just who composed those atmospheric soundscapes and gauzy melodies. The band's music is spot-on for soundtrack work precisely because it's moody yet unobtrusive, evocative of something, yet noncommittal enough to conceivably fit any emotional tableaux. Thanks to vocalist Rachel Stolte, the album's more driving, insistent, and therefore most successful tracks, particularly ""Houses"", ""Story"", ""Snakes"", and ""Mountain"", approximate the sound of Madonna fronting a group of stylishly dark, beat-minded rockers from that mid-to-late 90s period when a patina of techno was seemingly de rigueur for would-be-hip MOR guitar acts. There are no shortage of nice touches in these songs-- ""Mountains"" is propelled by big, cascading drums while ""Snakes"" arrives on Flaming Lips-ish strings and rides an attractively loping, buzzy guitar line, yet all the major moves are pretty baldly telegraphed, and the results are eminently predictable if admittedly somewhat satisfying in their punchy loudness. The same can't be said for the tracks predominantly sung by co-principal Solon Bixler, which are more heavily distributed towards the back end of the record, and weigh it down perceptibly with purely flat dream-rock wallpaper, forgetting the saving grace of even the least interesting shoegaze band to at least crank up the damn volume. Great Northern may continue to be soundtrack heroes, but complementary aural scenery is likely all the group will ever be so long as its music can't do anything more significant than remind me how I sort of dug former Veruca Salt frontwoman Nina Gordon's first solo album.","Moody yet unobtrusive, Great Northern's music is evocative of something but we're not exactly sure what that something is.

Peri,Bardo Pond,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e0c0084474cd0c037c/1:1/w_160/67442ce4.jpg,2009-05-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12971-peri/,Three Lobed,"Philadelphia's Bardo Pond have been an underground fixture for so long that it can become easy to overlook them. But they've carved out an impressive psych-rock niche for themselves over the course of their now 15+ year career, a niche that seems more than ever to be exclusively their own. The past several years have frequently found Bardo Pond in retrospective mode, sifting through mountains of past jams and improvisational experiments. So far they've self-released seven volumes of unearthed outtakes and rarities, and last year Three-Lobed Recordings issuedÂ Batholith, a potent collection of previously unreleased material. Evidently the vaults have not yet been fully exhausted, for now the Bardos have teamed again with Three-Lobed to releaseÂ Peri, a companion album to Batholith that contains many prized tracks that have, for one reason or another, never found a home on any of the group's proper studio albums. And though these tracks are by definition outtakes, the album is sequenced to be a cohesive listening experience in its own right, and the highlights hold their own against anything in the vast Bardo Pond back catalogue. The hallmark sounds of Bardo Pond have shifted and evolved slightly over the years, but their central approach to heavy psych-rock remains fixed. Guitarist brothers Michael and John Gibbons have never liked their riffs tidied and lined up single-file, instead preferring a layered, overlapping sound that blurs every angle, leading to a heightened sense of disorientation. Another, more polarizing, constant in their sound has been vocalist Isobel Sollenberger's contributions on flute, with some of their fussier listeners judging a given track's success by the amount of flute it might or might not contain. Recorded at the band's Philly headquarters during their 1996-2001 Matador era, the tracks onÂ Peri showcase all of Bardo Pond's prevailing tendencies to potent effect. (Flute quotient: moderate to low.) To my ears, this collection improves uponÂ Batholith largely based on the strength of the two pieces that form the LP's second side. ""Chicken Gun"", a long-time live staple, is the band at their grungiest, with the rhythm section of bassist Clint Takeda and drummer Ed Farnsworth kicking up a formidable storm while the guitarists stretch the song's riff like black taffy. Even more transporting is the closing ""Silver Pavilion"", on which Sollenberger trades flute for a ghostly viola, and the whole band displays its uncanny knack for focused yet center-less group improvisation. Whatever your feelings about Sollenberger's flute, there is little denying that she remains a captivating frontwoman, even as her words are frequently submerged into the group's dark rising tides. Her dazed, narcotic vocals are the perfect vehicle when Bardo Pond want to explore their more pastoral side, as on ""The Path"", and her presence also helps gives their heavier material an ineffable human touch. Although it will be most valuable to established fans,Â Peri is an ideal complement to such vintage Bardo albums as 1997'sÂ Lapsed or 2001'sÂ Dilate, and it is a comfort to take the time to idle awhile in its enveloping glow.","Underground psych-rock vets continue to clear the vaults, unearthing prime jams and outtakes from the 1996-2001 era.

Grandes Exitos,Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38d13d1975652138af2/1:1/w_160/aae79e5f.jpg,2009-05-01 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12909-grandes-exitos/,self-released,"In a Pitchfork review four-and-a-half years old but still applicable, Nick Sylvester wrote that The Doldrums, Ariel Pink's first widely available album, ""can't contain Ariel Pink, and wasn't supposed to, and his next 500 CD-Rs will have the same problem. The songs are secondary to Pink's bourgeoning cult of personality-- the album turns its imperfections into selling points."" What Nick and I disagreed over (and probably still would) is my pretty firm belief that Ariel Pink's music-- which sounds like 1960s jangle-pop, car commercials, and gauzy 80s ballads echoing inside a tin can-- is music whose imperfections actually are its selling point: Without them, it would sound like the sweatless work of studio hacks; with them, it sounds like a horrorshow. So why commend him? Because Ariel Pink has recorded the saddest music I've heard in the past several years. But wait, you're thinking, I already have all these records by the loneliest loners murmuring about the wintriest winters. To which I'll say that, in singing about the wintriest winters, the loneliest loners are fully aware of their sadness and are probably trying to resolve it, either through the act of making art, or through the community that their art might create. When you put a bunch of lonely loners standing in a room together, they might just get a glimpse at companionship. Conversely, Ariel Pink takes ""perfect,"" professional music and scours its perfect professionalism so ruthlessly that the product sounds solitary, disgraced, and pathetic. This isn't the sadness of the heartbroken teenager, but of Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights: Failure that doesn't recognize itself, or a goal debauched. If I sound high on my own poetry, take solace in the fact that I'm writing at the tip of the iceberg for my feelings on this music. Most of the music he's released since The Doldrums was recorded before 2004 (a fact that felt a little opportunistic in 2006 and a little disturbing now that it's 2009). In a way, Nick S. turned out to be right: Ariel Pink capitalized on his myth as a lunatic hermit by flooding the market with whatever he had in his closet without ever having to develop that persona with an audience watching. In light of all this, I find it riddling and weird that the two-disc Grandes Exitos-- ""Greatest Hits,"" for our gringo readers-- is a tour-only release, when it could arguably serve as one of his only official releases. It's a solid and decently assembled set that highlights some of his most enchanting pop (the nocturnal, yearning ""For Kate I Wait"", the shuffling ""Life in L.A."", [""The weather is your boyfriend/ On a Saturday, stay in bed""], ""Every Night I Die at Miyagis"") and some of his most inane (""Immune To Emotion"" was funnier and more heartbreaking when he didn't spell it out, ""Credit"" which sounds a lot like Weird Al but probably wouldn't tickle even the most 12-year-old 12 year old). None of his CD-Rs have reached the same highs-- lows?-- as The Doldrums, but they've had enough decent material on them to make Grandes Exitos fully listenable from start to finish (which I can't say about all his albums). Whether or not you'll like it is something I can't predict-- Ariel Pink, to his credit and damnation, is still a guy who most would probably rate as an interstellar genius or bullshit artist (or try really, really hard to see him as a little bit of both). I'm making an effort to be fair when I say I think there's enough merit and magic on this collection or The Doldrums to suggest that you listen without wondering whether he's a spoonfed art-school brat or a sniffling pothead or a mentally fragile Californian or, very possibly, all of those things. I'm making an effort to suggest you listen without wondering whether he ""really means it or not,"" or, if you do wonder, to consider what ""it"" refers to. If you want to know if Ariel Pink is direct, well, he's not. A half-erased, yowling song called ""Good Kids Make Bad Grownups"" just doesn't parse as cleanly as a rockin' song called ""Rock and Roll All Nite"". With Ariel Pink, the feeling is conveyed in the sound that frays around him. Call him a phony if you want, but he's a phony all his own.","A well-chosen tour-only ""Greatest Hits"" set from the inscrutable lo-fi singer/songwriter is, surprisingly enough, fully listenable from start to finish.

Broken Record Prayers,Comet Gain,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33eb1335d7bf16986b3/1:1/w_160/6d102746.jpg,2009-05-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12848-broken-record-prayers/,What's Your Rupture?,"Comet Gain are one of the most underrated contemporary indie bands in the UK. Although in the 16 years since their inception they've never made major waves outside the DIY indie community (although those waves stretched far and wide-- the band is also well-loved in the U.S. and France), they have gained a fierce following of music lovers who seem to share their passion for Orange Juice, Anna Karina, old typewriters, George Orwell, Dexys Midnight Runners, and, above all else, vinyl. Like their riot-grrrl peers (guitarist Jon Slade was a founding member of Huggy Bear), this band doesn't distinguish art from life, and has stuck to its collective passion at all costs-- namely, relative obscurity. As the photograph on the cover of Broken Record Prayers states, in black marker scrawled on the back of a woman's hand, ""Dreams Never End"". This is Comet Gain's motto-- a dogma that has been declared throughout the years by vocalist/guitarist David Feck, and which they act on wholeheartedly. It's been four years since the release of their fifth album, City Fallen Leaves, so Broken Record Prayers, a ""collection of A- and B-sides, new songs, session tracks, and stray dogs recorded between 1998-2008"" is a timely and carefully filtered introduction to their discography. Impressively, these disparate songs flow together with bright, energetic fluency-- a difficult task for an archival project such a this. ""Young Lions"", ""Emotion Pictures"", and ""Tighten Up!"" are taken from a 1997 Peel Session, while a couple of their best tracks, ""You Can Hide Your Love Forever"" and ""Beautiful Despair"", were once available on limited vinyl only. Perhaps the most powerful of these early singles is the opening track, ""Jack Nance Hair"", which was originally released on journalist Everett True's now defunct Mei Mei label. A semi-spoken declaration of purpose, Feck takes turns with fellow vocalist Rachel Evans to comment on the importance of ""going home and listening to records with stained sleeves"" and ""getting back that fire and making your feelings known."" Its message burns with urgency: ""Believe in art/ Believe in yourself/ Contradict yourself."" All Comet Gain fans know what a special band they are, but this 20-song collection, lifted from half a dozen different releases, really brings home all their accomplishments over a lengthy and productive career. As sometime member Chris Appelgren (also of The PeeChees and The Pattern) astutely comments, the band is ""messy, sweet, and tipsy."" On Broken Record Prayers, there are echoes of Northern Soul (""Love Without Lies""), Felt (""Books of California""), and, of course, their obsession with Orange Juice leaks between every crack. They also bring their gawky magic to covers of Curtis Mayfield's ""Hard Times"" and Dena Barnes' ""If You Ever Walk Out Of My Life"", which is wrung with sorrowful lamentations that exquisitely fit the band's self-propelled image as romantic revolutionaries. One hopes that this excellent compilation will help shine a light on Comet Gain's escapades. Whether it does or not, you can be sure that the group will continue on the path they've set for themselves, recording garage pop in their London apartment, fueled by red wine and stories of heartbreak and adventure. As Evans affirms: ""Together we stand and feel stronger and braver for it/ Young, free and single/ Like the crack in the 45/ That makes the guitar snap all night/ And in the morning it starts all over again.""","This 20-song collection of the underrated UK band's decade of output provides a timely and carefully filtered introduction to its discography.

CelebraciÃ³n de la Ciudad Natal,My Morning Jacket,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ddc0084474cd0c0373/1:1/w_160/adeac914.jpg,2009-05-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12968-celebracion-de-la-ciudad-natal/,ATO,"My Morning Jacket may have made the leap from an under-the-radar indie outfit to virtually the only jam band with hipster cred, but as far as they have grown from their roots, MMJ haven't forgotten where they came from. Case in point: To support and celebrate this past Record Store Day, My Morning Jacket released CelebraciÃ³n de la Ciudad Natal, a double live 10"" exclusive recorded in both Louisville's indie record shop ear X-tacy as well as during a three-hour set at the city's Waterfront Park. Even the title tips its hat to the group's Kentucky stomping grounds, translating to ""celebrating the city of my birth."" The music itself showcases the group in fine form, which is to be expected. Even those who grumble at their perceived fumbles will concede that My Morning Jacket remain a force to be reckoned with on stage. From the (more or less) straight Southern rock of ""Evil Urges"" to the dubious Cameo nod ""Highly Suspicious"" and the folk-country of ""Librarian"", songs from last year's Evil Urges benefit from the extra breathing space provided by a live airing. ""Gideon"" gets to drop some atmospherics and gain in sharpness, while fellow Z track ""Dondante"" is doubled in length to over 14 minutes, demonstrating the qualities that make the group such a live draw. The band also revisits ""Phone Went West"" (from At Dawn) and performs ""Where to Begin"", its contribution to the Elizabethtown soundtrack (all 10 people who caught the Cameron Crowe flop may recall it was set in Kentucky). Yet CelebraciÃ³n de la Ciudad Natal is less valuable for the music than for the message it sends. ""I've been buying records at ear X-tacy since I was a tadpole,"" says Jim James on the release. ""I think the thing that people forget about is the community and the memories that are created when you come to an independent and locally owned record store that you can only get in that town."" It used to be that release day was also often the first chance you had to hear a band's new material, and divisive albums like My Morning Jacket's Evil Urges (released the day of the June 2008 ear X-tacy appearance) still had the power to shock and/or surprise you. Sadly, for many the record store is now an afterthought, the end point after days, weeks, or even months of circulated leaks that leech each new release of its dramatic impact. It's debatable how much else has actually been lost along with those once-formative listening experiences, but certainly the sense of community James toasts has at least changed. Would My Morning Jacket have graduated to their current level without that initial surge of grassroots word-of-mouth indie support? Maybe. But one imagines the way they got there would have been quite different, and perhaps less forgiving of an upstart act finding its way forward. Consider, then, CelebraciÃ³n de la Ciudad Natal as a sort of testament to the intangible, a reminder of the long gone thrill when Record Store Day came every week.","This double live 10"" released on Record Store Day pulls songs from 2001's At Dawn up through 2008's Evil Urges.

Summer of Hate,Crocodiles,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3deea9e61561daa4d8e/1:1/w_160/c27f2c5a.jpg,2009-04-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12969-summer-of-hate/,Fat Possum,"It's hard to understand Crocodiles' artistic intent behind a song like ""I Wanna Kill"". A sufficiently catchy rock number that's found the San Diego-based duo some internet love, the song blatantly steals from, among other classic pop tunes, the Jesus and Mary Chain's 1989 semi-hit ""Head On"". And I don't mean that bandmembers Charles Rowell and Brandon Welchez were just influenced or inspired by the JAMC track, but that they've actually photocopied its melody and plopped it into their own song. Now, I'm not suggesting bands don't knick ideas from other acts (that's commonplace) or that every new group is required to fashion its own utterly unique sound (that's impossible), but theft is theft, and if this were college, Crocodiles would be expelled for plagiarism. So why is anyone interested in these dudes? Well, they were name-checked by No Age in a 2008 year-end list and, sadly, that's all it takes to build a buzz these days-- one mention from a well-known group and you're the next Wavves. That's not No Age's fault or Crocodiles', but it does put on display the absurdity of the internet music community's never-ending, indiscriminate space race to find the next hot new band. In any case, it doesn't make much sense to compare this group to the noise-pop acts they're being lumped in with because, well, they're not very noisy. Outside of the background squeal of ""I Wanna Kill"" and a distorted drumbeat on (the also JAMC-aping) ""Refuse Angels"", most of what Crocodiles do on their debut LP, Summer of Hate, is actually pretty clean sounding. The record's split into a couple of different stylistic categories. In addition to the... let's call it ""reverential"" rock stuff mentioned above, there are several synth-pop tracks that range from slower pieces to more upbeat dance numbers. What most of these songs lack in inventiveness they tend to make up for in melody; if nothing else, these guys know their way around a catchy hook. Despite sounding brazenly Rapture-lite, herky-jerky dance-punk number ""Soft Skull (In My Room)"" is a fine-tuned hipster boogie. And synth stomper ""Flash of Light"" is enough of an earworm to wiggle into your head for a few hours. Crocodiles present their smartest work on the album's ballads, slower synth-pop pieces loosely built around the form perfected by 80s crossover acts such as OMD and Tears for Fears. They do some Beatles harmonizing atop wobbly Santo & Johnny guitars on ""Here Comes the Sky"" and construct a long, pleasant synth-and-vocal build on ""Sleeping With the Lord""-- and these are easilyÂ Summer of Hate's best tracks. In fact, if the whole record were done in this style, it'd be worth the buzz. Instead of focusing on one idea and shaping it into something unique, though, the album tries its hand at everything that is ""now"" (noise-pop, dance rock, etc.) and owns none of it.","Split between 80s noise-pop and synth-pop,Â Crocodiles present their smartest work on the album's OMD-like ballads.

Tragic Boogie,The Life and Times,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e7c0084474cd0c0392/1:1/w_160/1ecdf47e.jpg,2009-04-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12978-tragic-boogie/,Arena Rock,"If the Life and Times chose to release their newest album through the Arena Rock Recording Co. simply because of the label's name, that wouldn't be much of a surprise. Despite their budgetary restrains, the Life and Times have done their best to imbue their music with a sound and swagger enormous enough to theoretically fill any venue imaginable. It's been nearly four years since their debut, and that time's been well spent turning their awkwardly titled second album into a sonic monolith. While the group's previous works can't be accused of modesty or restraint, Tragic Boogie downright revels in its excess. As with their first full length, Suburban Hymns, the Life and Times combine shoegazey guitars and textures with apocalyptic slabs of percussion and rhythm-- every time a drum is hit or a bass string is strummed, it's as if tectonic plates are being shifted. If you want to give the group some poetic leeway, they might be accused of describing their sound on ""Fall of the Angry Clowns""-- ""it's not unlike falling upwards."" Sadly, folks looking for words that match the heft of their sounds might be disappointed by the abstractions and imagistic meanderings the group employs. But on a record like this, words are a secondary concern-- whatever meanings these songs are meant to convey is done strictly through the music, and Tragic Boogie is at its best when it remembers this. The second half peters out in this regard-- after offering an endless barrage of pyrotechnics, the title track and ""The Politics of Driving"" take a more genial and measured approach. Paired with ""The Lucid Dream"", a tune that bears an astonishing (and welcome) resemblance to Doves or a down-tempo Swervedriver, these three second-half tracks trip up the record's momentum-- the 100-car-pile-up outro of ""Politics"" tries to regain the album's hell-bent momentum, but to no avail. As nice as a respite from all this grandeur might seem, the band does itself no favors by playing against its strengths. The late-record detours can't hold a candle to the shameless bombast on display in ""Angry Clowns"", or the grand piano chords that strafe the entirety of ""Dull Knives"". From the first effected chord struck in the album's opener, ""Que Sera Sera"", to the moment in ""Confetti"" where the cacophony suddenly gives way to acoustic strumming, the Life and Times offer listeners a thrilling cinematic journey through their meticulously constructed world of sound. In fact, it's probably best to approach Tragic Boogie the way you'd approach a summer movie blockbuster-- there might not be much happening on the screen in terms of substantive depth, but it looks and sounds great, and the special effects are out of this world.","The Life and Times have attempted to imbue their music with a sound and swagger enormous enough to theoretically fill any venue imaginable.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 11A: 1971/The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 11B: 1971",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3635e6ef95969320635/1:1/w_160/e708efa3.jpg,2009-04-30 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12880-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-11a-1971the-complete-motown-singles-vol-11b-1971/,Hip-O Select,"Motown is 50 years old in 2009. January 21 marked the half-century anniversary of Marv Johnson's ""Come to Me"", the first single on Berry Gordy's Tamla label. Motown Record Corporation ceased to be an independent company in 1988, when Gordy sold it for $61 million, not a bad return on the initial $800 loan his family gave him to get started. To say it's been an eventful 50 years is an understatement, but nothing that's happened since 1972 can compete with the company's first 13 years in business in terms of commercial success, cultural impact, and overall artistic quality. Those 13 years coincide with Motown's time in its home city and namesake: Detroit. It's this period, from 1959 to 1972, that Hip-O Select's ultra-comprehensive, beautifully packaged, and exhaustively annotated Complete Motown Singles series of boxed sets will ultimately cover when the final set is issued. Previously, most of the sets have encompassed a full year of output from Motown and its subsidiaries (the exception was Volume 1, which covered 1959-1961), but 1971, the label's last full year in Detroit, is represented by two five-disc sets, discs 56-65 in the series. It's an enormous amount of music, made slightly less substantial by the fact that many tracks, 57 in all, are doubled up in stereo promo versions or alternate mixes. One gets the sense from listening, reading, and perusing the tracklist that 1971 was a difficult year for Motown in many respects. Faced with a dramatically different pop landscape, a cumbersome operating structure split between Detroit and Los Angeles, the fading stars of some of its long-time marquee acts, and a lot more direct competition from other soul labels, Gordy's empire showed its first signs of decline, even as it prepared to expand into the movie business. In 1970, seven Motown songs topped the Billboard Hot 100. In 1971, only the Temptations' enduring classic ""Just My Imagination"" managed to hit #1, though many Motown releases topped the R&B chart. That song, a tender, startlingly intimate portrait of a man constructing an elaborate fantasy relationship with a woman he doesn't even know, was a throwback to the rich harmony sound the group had left behind in 1968, when producer Norman Whitfield cranked up the funk and took them on the psychedelic soul ride that made hits out of ""Cloud Nine"", ""I Can't Get Next to You"", ""Ball of Confusion"", and others. It was also the last song to feature founding members Eddie Kendricks, who went solo, and Paul Williams, who left the group because of poor health. Kendricks gave perhaps the best performance of his whole career to the song, which was backed on the B-side by ""You Make Your Own Heaven and Hell Right Here on Earth"", another swirling, psychedelic soul bomb. Whitfield and the Tempts' stylistic dip into the past serves as a sort of metaphor for much of the recycling that took place at Motown in 1971. Whitfield himself cut most of his songs with more than one artist, pulling out old tunes to rework, and scoring a hit with the Undisputed Truth's spooky re-do of the Temptations album track ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"". The Truth were Whitfield's laboratory, where he worked on stretching the boundaries of his production style, practice that helped him create some of the label's most enduring tracks from the period. The recycling in other quarters of Motown was a little more basic, as Gordy and his Los Angeles crew tried to boost Diana Ross' still-precarious solo career by digging up the Four Tops' ""Reach Out (I'll Be There)"". Radically reworked into a bombastic two-part suite, it hit the Top 30, but doesn't hold a candle to the Tops. Ross' best single in 1971 was ""Surrender"", a towering, cosmopolitan soul track that features very Supremes-like backing vocals. The most egregious example of the label raiding the past, though, was the Elgins' ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"", a leftover from 1966 that must have sounded awfully out of place in 1971, in spite of its quality. The biggest value of these sets is their unique ability to cast the biggest names and hits on Motown in their context among the flops and oddities that competed with them for attention. More than any set since 1964, this one is full of bizarre asides, should-have-been-hits, and historical curiosities. Rare Earth, Gordy's rock-oriented subsidiary, had a busy release schedule, churning out mostly anodyne, easily forgotten album rock, but it was occasionally interesting. The band the label was named for, Rare Earth, scored big with the psychedelic funk track ""I Just Want to Celebrate"", which still sounds pretty great, while the Messengers' super-catchy power-pop number ""That's the Way a Woman Is"" deserved to place higher than #62 on the pop chart, and British act Brass Monkey turns in an interesting, progged-out cover of the Supremes' ""You Keep Me Hangin' On"" that owes more to the Vanilla Fudge version than it does to the original. Far more puzzling today are the true outliers on the set. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Berry Gordy co-founded the Ecology label specifically for Davis' future releases, but after one horrible flop-- the treacly, didactic ""In My Own Life Time""-- the label quietly folded and the partnership ceased. Los Angeles DJ Tom Clay's weird collage ""What the World Needs Now Is Love/Abraham, Martin & John"" clobbers the listener over the head with the sounds of warfare, news reports about assassinations, and children talking trying to define words like prejudice. Clay's other offering, on Vol. 11B, is basically a song-poem, with its off-key vocal and inept songwriting. Dave Prince's ""The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived"" is a weird spoken-word piece about Jesus on about the same par as Chuck Woolery's pre-""Love Connection"" travesty ""The Greatest Love Affair"". Other forgotten tracks fall more in the treasure category, none more so than Gordon Staples & the Motown Strings' ""Strung Out"". Gordon Staples was the concertmaster of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and played a Stradivarius violin, but he was no classical music snob-- he lead numerous string sessions for labels all over Detroit, and you can hear him all over the Motown catalog. This wasn't so much his record, though, as it was long-time Motown arranger Paul Riser's. His charts use the sound of the orchestra tuning up to brilliant effect and features a heavy, sample-ready groove courtesy of the Funk Brothers. Chuck Jackson's ""Pet Names"" showcases what a powerful, interesting singer he was, his gravelly voice soaring through a wickedly tough, syncopated melody. Hugh Masekela's Chisa label ended its association with Motown in the early 70s, but not before Masekela and his Union of South Africa released the supercharged Afrofunk burner ""Dyambo (Weary Day Is Over)"", which features a strange and inspired scat vocal from Caiphus Semenya, on which he imitates the sounds of scratching records and elephants and somehow makes the song better. Sammy Davis, Jr. wasn't the only old crooner to pass through Motown that year. Bobby Darin, who back in 1958 had cut a forgotten record on a song written by Berry Gordy, attempted to reinvent himself as a singer/songwriter near the end of his too-short life, and his ""Simple Song of Freedom"" is a pleasant surprise-- it's not subtle at all, but it has an easy groove, and you can hear in his performance that Darin was finally doing what he wanted to on record. Brothers David and Jimmy Ruffin, who'd each had varying levels of success and were both more popular in Europe than in the U.S., cut a record together in 1971 called My Brother's Keeper, and their duo single ""Lo And Behold"" is an absolutely brilliant slice of gospel soul, with great unison singing and a long, languid melody. Perhaps one of the reasons this singles collection feels more scattered than most of its predecessors is that, like the rest of the music industry, Motown in 1971 was trying to transition to the era of the album. By far the label's greatest achievement in that arena in 1971 was Marvin Gaye's epochal masterpiece What's Going On. The missing question mark was intentional-- Marvin was telling you what was going on, not asking, and what he saw was a nation in turmoil, tied down in a senseless war, wasting its natural beauty, and ignoring poverty. Gordy resisted What's Going On for as long as he could, agreeing to release it only after Gaye threatened never to record again, and it was an instant landmark. The singles gathered here are surprising for casual Gaye fans who know only the LP. The title track appears in a drastically different (and inferior) mix from the album version, ""Mercy Mercy Me"" and ""Inner City Blues"" are understandably truncated to fit on 45s, and the B-side versions of ""Wholy Holy"" and ""God Is Love"" are prototypes of the album versions that use backing tracks from a session Marvin Gaye produced for the Originals. It's a fascinating glimpse at the process that led him to the final realization of his vision. While Marvin Gaye finally got the artistic freedom he desired and emerged with an enduring classic, Stevie Wonder, now an adult, offered a foreshadowing of the amazing run of albums he was about to create on the tender, aching ballad ""I Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer"" and the complex, jazzy ""If You Really Love Me"". As Stevie graduated onto an adult stage, Motown's other kid sensation, Michael Jackson, stepped out on his own for the first time, with the surprisingly adult ""Got to Be There"", on which he sings about complexities of sexual relationships he couldn't possibly have yet understood. Frankly, though, he still sounded a lot better in the company of his brothers, especially on the jaw-dropping ""Never Can Say Goodbye"", on which he sounds like a man spurned many times over, trapped in the body of a child, singing his guts out. There was still plenty of success in Motown's future after 1971, but over the course of these two sets, it becomes increasingly clear that things changed for good at Motown, and that the focused creative crucible and tight quality control that made the label such a dominant force in the 60s couldn't be recaptured. In spite of the changes, there was still plenty of excellent music here, and if you've been collecting these sets so far, you need these, too. As Motown celebrates 50 years of making music, it's fascinating and entertaining to revisit a time when it was still an active sculptor of the American cultural landscape and see how the shifting landscape shaped it in return.","Hip-O Select's exhaustively annotated and beautifully packaged series of boxed sets continues with 10 discs worth of material from 1971.

The Sleeping Bag Sessions,Arthur Russell,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d713d1975652138b9d/1:1/w_160/cb5206ad.jpg,2009-04-30 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12963-the-sleeping-bag-sessions/,Traffic Entertainment,"Since many of us are old-school album-types who'd dismiss a B-sides compilation for being flabby, critics often damn records like The Sleeping Bag Sessions by calling them collections of ""odds and ends."" Maybe that's not a dismissive phrase to your ears, especially now that track-at-a-time blog culture has turned us all into scavengers to one degree or another. But to me it's always suggested the remixes and lesser-known experiments and doodles finally deemed fit to turn a buck after every other nook and cranny of an artist's oeuvre has been exploited. Said dismissal becomes even more problematic when applied to Arthur Russell, who scoffed at ""coherence"" when it came to making aesthetic connections, developing a songwriting language, maintaining career momentum, or even attributing his work. No wonder the 21st-century compilations of Russell's music-- excepting perhaps 2008's song-focused Love Is Overtaking Me-- have felt like grab-bags, usually in interesting ways. That said, The Sleeping Bag Sessions is easily the least interesting-- certainly the least revelatory-- posthumous Russell collection yet released. The title-- Sleeping Bag was the record label co-owned by Russell, home to some of his most outrÃ© work and his most commercial-- supposedly lends the much-needed thread binding these 10 very disparate tracks. The work varies widely in quality, the tracks feel sketchily connected at best (even with the label-specific focus), and the whole thing seems thrown together. I'm not sure why we needed not one but two versions of ""5 Minutes"", a novelty dance cut built on samples of Ronald Reagan, except that they were until now uncollected. They're not bad, just inert, one-note agitprop gags that have failed to gain charm with nostalgic hindsight, their stuttering special effects lacking both the strangeness and pop punch of contemporaneous remix kings like the Latin Rascals. (The bassline's aged even more poorly.) And I'm also not sure if the Sounds of JHS 126 Brooklyn's ""Chill Pill"" is mildly peppy disco-rap made annoying by Russell's echo and reverb play, or forgettable old-school made slightly notable by trippy effects. Either way, it sounds slight, inessential. Those are the lows. The highs are welcome but familiar, and more or less all lengthy semi-improvisations playing with traditional disco rhythms. The 12-minute Walter Gibbons mix of ""Go Bang"" pulses with percussive energy queered by dub technique, while smoothing out some of the vocal and musical eccentricities found in other mixes. The remixer even daringly ditches all extraneous stage dressing at the four-minute mark to maximize the tension of his little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte between a dry bass thump, warehouse-cavernous snare crash, and gnarled, staccato guitar. Stark and loud against the negative space he's punched into Russell's previously bustling soundscape, Gibbons' drums are so tactile that a shaker's rustle can buzz right up your spine. Likewise, ""School Bell/Tree House"" does much the same for pattering hand drums, though Russell smears the mid-range with his trademark cello hum. But these are well-established works of genius, for-certain cornerstones of Russell's tricky canon. The rest is padding at best, disco and downtown semi-obscurities given a profile boost thanks to Russell's late-decade burst of acclaim. The Felix collaboration with Nicky Siano is fine enough mix-fodder, but that's fainter praise than it reads considering their storming work together on ""Kiss Me Again"". It's not as if The Sleeping Bag Sessions is going to do some violence to Russell's quite secure rep. But neophytes are advised to let their fingers continue walking past this in the ""R"" rack until they find a copy of 2004's still-essential World of Arthur Russell.","Alas, this is the least interesting-- and certainly the least revelatory-- posthumous Arthur Russell collection yet released.

Together Through Life,Bob Dylan,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e85e6ef9596932074a/1:1/w_160/483c8921.jpg,2009-04-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12979-together-through-life/,Columbia,"When did Bob Dylan become such a nostalgic? He's always had an ear for the language and music of the past, of course-- that's part of what's made him special from the get-go. Over the course of his past few albums, though, he's been framing himself as a one-man preservation society, the keeper of the flame for a conception of the popular song tradition that slams shut sometime around the release of his own first record in 1962. Together Through Life owes a lot to the sound of 1950s Chicago blues, in particular, and to a few other sorts of records it's easy to imagine Dylan playing on his ""Theme Time Radio Hour"". It's not surprising that a deluxe version comes with a bonus disc containing an episode of the radio show. But Dylan's best records don't just use the ten thousand glittering fragments he's found in the history of music and literature, they transform his source material. This one is just a pastiche of records about which he's enthusiastic, and sometimes a blatant imitation of the kind of stuff they don't make any more. ""Jolene"" (not a Dolly Parton cover) lives down the street from Little Richard's ""Lucille"" and Chuck Berry's ""Nadine""; ""My Wife's Home Town"" is just a set of lazy new lyrics grafted onto the Muddy Waters arrangement of Willie Dixon's ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"". ""My band plays a different type of music than anybody else plays,"" Dylan recently told Rolling Stone. ""As far as I know, no one else out there plays like this. Today, yesterday, Â and probably tomorrow."" This suggests that he has never heard a moderately decent blues band in a bar. The one genuinely unprecedented element of the band's sound is his singing voice, which at this point is a wonder on the order of a wrecked 67 Saab that still manages to start even though the rust has penetrated clear through to the steering wheel. Dylan tends to treat every album as a discrete project rather than as his latest status report; this one's parameters, besides ""I've been listening to a lot of stuff on Chess lately and also some Tex-Mex and a little bit of Edith Piaf,"" are the welcome presence of David Hidalgo on lead accordion all over the place, and the somewhat more questionable presence of former Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, who co-wrote the lyrics of nine of the album's 10 songs. (The other, uncredited co-lyricist, as the overseers of Dylan's concordance have already figured out, is Geoffrey Chaucer: Magpie Bob lifted a bunch of shiny words and phrases from David Wright's translation of The Canterbury Tales.) The lyrical persona this time alternates between old-dude-feeling-randy (""You are as whorish as ever, baby, you could start a fire"") and old-dude-feeling-old (""The door has closed forevermore/ If indeed there ever was a door""). When Hunter and Dylan aren't firing off bon mots, though, they seem to be aiming for the unobtrusive universality of vintage popular songs-- the first line of the album is ""oh well I love you pretty baby."" Together Through Life isn't without its charms-- Dylan never is. It's just very minor, especially by his standards. He's the most inconsistent of great popular musicians, because if there's one thing he's consistently kicked against, it's doing what anybody expects of him, including the standard late-career decline. After Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft, it's impossible to write him off as taking a long victory lap. But the Dylan record Together is closest to in spirit isn't those, or even Desire (the last time he collaborated on a full album with another lyricist). It's the commercial-country pastiche Nashville Skyline, a genre exercise that had a lot more spirit than this. That album's capstone was ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You"", a sly, lithe love song; this one's is ""It's All Good"", a prefab boogie on which Dylan comes off like an indignant old crank grousing about glib, optimistic whippersnappers. The ultimate test of a Dylan album, though, is to try to consider it outside the imposing context of his career--to imagine that the bramble-voiced old dude who co-wrote and sang these songs isn't the man who wrote Highway 61 Revisited and Blood on the Tracks and Love and Theft, but Random Blues Journeyman #843. To which the reaction would have to be: This guy's pretty OK. He's tough to take at length, but he's clever, he's got some range, there's a funny line about Billy Joe Shaver and James Joyce. He might have something good in him sometime.

Ape School,Ape School,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e55e6ef95969320742/1:1/w_160/8e5d6bca.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12975-ape-school/,Counter,"Though Ape School is technically a self-titled debut album, it is more accurately described as the sophomore effort of musician Michael Johnson, whose first release, Nonsense Goes Mudslide, came out under his own nondescript name back in 2004. Since he's essentially a solo artist and his sound has not changed significantly, the shift to a band identity seems to be mainly in the interest of pragmatism. (If you search for Michael Johnson in the iTunes store, you will mostly find the work of a soft rock singer/songwriter from the 1970s.) Ape School specialize in jaunty yet hazy psychedelia directly indebted to the Silver Apples, United States of America, and other early innovators of electronic instrumentation. Though many others have attempted to mimic the sound of those classic works, Johnson has the advantage of working with one of the earliest Moog analog synthesizers, which lends his recordings an uncanny air of authenticity. Even if there are telltale signs of modern technology and musical influence throughout the album, nearly all of the songs could pass as vintage tunes. This mostly comes down to the fact that Johnson's affections are very low-key, and that he entirely avoids the sort of self-conscious meta touches that typically characterize each successive wave of psychedelic revivalism. Most often, it seems as though he is simply writing songs to flatter the established strengths of his instrument. Of course, the downside of that approach is that his Moog tones never feel particularly fresh or surprising, even when the sound itself is quite interesting and appealing. As an album, Ape School displays an admirable dynamic range, but it nevertheless has an extremely limited emotional palette. Despite its continuum of melodies and tempos, every track conveys feelings that are indeterminate and passionless, which has a way of making the record as a whole drift by in a blur. To a certain extent, this must be the desired effect of Johnson's compostions-- much of the lyrics indicate indecision and muted emotions, and several tracks deliberately detour into zoned-out reveries. That strategy is most effective in ""Did What I Did"", which starts off as a bouncy British Invasion number before drifting out into a slow mantra over an ambient keyboard hum. Johnson is also successful when he leans hard on groovy percussion, as in the Silver Apples sound-alike ""My Intention"", and the vaguely aggressive ""Deathstomp"". The quality of the songwriting dips somewhat in the album's final third, but there are no outright duds, and it's easy to forgive aimless numbers like ""In Time You Are"" and ""Floridian Grime"" when the record is mostly characterized by the tunefulness of frontloaded highlights such as ""Wail to God"", ""That's OK"", and ""Be an Encore"". In the right mood-- or altered state-- Ape School is a pleasure, but outside of that state of mind, the music can seem somewhat lacking. Johnson's talent is hard to deny, but he could do well to become more ambitious in his arrangements. His tastes in melody, rhythm, and texture are exceptional, but ultimately his work is low on inspiration and originality. Ape School is a respectable album, but it's hard not to wonder if Michael Johnson is capable of doing much more with his skills and equipment than what is evident in these recordings.","This one-man project specializes in jaunty, hazy psychedelia indebted to the Silver Apples and other early innovators of electronic instrumentation.

Colonia,A Camp,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e313d1975652138bb4/1:1/w_160/cbe84bd3.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12973-colonia/,Nettwerk,"""Love is stronger than Jesus,"" Nina Persson will have you believe, and to prove her point, she issues a further challenge to ""bring on the war and diseases."" Now, whether love is stronger than swine flu remains to be seen, but for Persson, it ultimately doesn't matter-- for her, the power of love is measured not by the elation but the devastation. Ever since presenting herself as a model of cheery Scandinavian congeniality on the cover of the Cardigans' Life back in 1995, Persson has played up the ironic distance between her pixie-esque appearance and the emotional unrest stirring in so many of her songs; on her second album as A Camp, the tally of bruised egos and broken hearts practically reaches pandemic proportions. The real irony here is that Persson's husband, Shudder to Think guitarist Nathan Larson, rides shotgun on this trail of rocky romances. Along with co-producer Niclas Frisk, he pushes Persson out of the forest fantasias created by Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous on A Camp's 2001 debut towards a sound that, true to Larson's glam-rock pedigree, is both more regal and urbane. As a solo outlet, the A Camp guise allows Persson to avoid the assumed confessional baggage that plagues so many singer-songwriters performing under their own name. And Colonia's luxuriant presentation makes it easier to imagine Persson as, well, a different person: the medieval mistress sarcastically saluting her ""murderous ass"" of a king on ""The Crowning""; the subservient rock-star groupie on the rollicking ""My America""; or the trophy wife in the acerbic lullaby ""I Signed the Line"" who decides she wants to cash out. And by fortuitous circumstance, ""Here Are Many Wild Animals""-- a study of primal desires cast in a girl-group gloss-- is given extra bite due to the fact the artist it most clearly references, Phil Spector, was recently caged for his own unsuppressed bloodlust. Given Persson's facility as a storyteller, it figures that Colonia's spell is broken whenever she breaks from character. ""Chinatown"", a snow-covered stroll through Persson's favorite New York 'hood, tries too hard to mythologize its everyday scenery, piling on the choral vocals, synthetic orchestration, and Asian guitar accents. And while the meta-duet with Nicolai Dunger on ""Golden Teeth and Silver Medals""-- wherein the two address each other by name and sing about singing a love song together-- has designs on subverting traditional pop-singer pairings, its blustery, spotlight-clamoring chorus essentially renders it a Swedish indie answer to wedding-song standards like ""Up Where We Belong"". But Colonia is mostly careful to use its expanded palette of sounds for subtle shading rather than gratuitous effect. This is particularly evident on the sublime closer, ""The Weed Had Got There First"", a serene piano-rolled promenade in which Persson chronicles a history of let-downs in botanical terms, but the closing passage-- where Persson blissfully la-di-da's along with the string section-- suggests regret is a feeling she's grown accustomed to. And so it is in Colonia's quietest moment that Persson's greatest gift becomes most audible: her knack for passing off disappointment as fulfillment.","The Cardigans' vocalist Nina Persson's second album as A Camp finds her moving toward a sound that's more regal and urbane.

Shout at the DÃ¶ner,Kid606,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d613d1975652138b99/1:1/w_160/36735037.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12962-shout-at-the-doner/,Tigerbeat6,"At the turn of the millennium, Kid606's name appeared so frequently in post-techno review sections and new release bulletins that it became a little overwhelming, even for those (like your reviewer) whose attention (and record-buying budget) was devoted almost solely to electronic music. It felt like every 606 single or CD was a window onto both a restless post-teen imagination and an American underground violently remaking European electronic innovations, whether brainy or boneheaded. But tastes shift, spending money dries up, life intervenes, shit happens. So caveat emptor: my lapsed fandom means I can't say with any certainty how Shout at the DÃ¶ner fits into the still dense Kid606 discography as a whole. What I do know is that it's a hell of a lot of fun-- a rough, dirty party album, a trawl through two decades of abusive bass and dancefloor bad taste. Then as now, it's the sort of digi-noise terror mixed messily in firetrap lofts and warehouses with crappy acoustics. On ""Hello Serotonin, My Old Friend""-- nice to see he hasn't lost his way with a punning title-- good ol' mechanical ""Mentasm"" synth effects shriek, eventually swallowed by a chaotic breakdown. But being dance music, rather than fried-circuit free noise, it's the viciously jacking drum track that's the real head-flattener. Make no mistake, Shout At The DÃ¶ner is a rhythm record. It just takes its programming cues from those foolhardy German and Dutch pioneers who sped Chicago snares and Detroit kicks into a gleefully abusive pummel. Not every track is necessarily as abrasive as ""Hello Serotonin""; a few could even slot onto a quasi-mainstream comp, if not quite your average super-club set. ""You All Break My Heart"" is more-or-less diva house. But even with the noise turned down (just a notch), those R&B ad libs and crashing electro drums can only be described as ""manic."" Like the rest of the best of Shout at the DÃ¶ner, ""You All Break My Heart"" feels ripped from that moment in any great DJ's set when the audience's screams start to challenge the din coming off the decks and you start eyeballing the exits just in case. This is an album that celebrates a history of hysteria and claustrophobia, of adverse reactions and temple-clutching come downs. A throwback to early 90s dark rave (""Dancehall of the Dead"") even induces tongue-in-cheek panic via a sample of Nick Cave asking dancers ""who wants to die?"" Somewhere a half-forgotten hardcore producer is listening at his day job and kicking himself for not having combed the Birthday Party catalog first. As all of these references to 10- or 15- or even 20-year-old subgenres might suggest, yes, Shout at the DÃ¶ner will feel mighty familiar to anyone who's spent time exploring the fuglier side of dance, the gabba greats and acid addicts who flayed their black boxes until they cried ""oom"" (or ""onkel""). But call it retro in service of sweat and smiles, celebrating the ridiculousness of dance music at its loudest and most unmannered. To illustrate how little distance separates the frenzy-inducing floor-fillers of 1989 and 2009, the Kid even offers a cheeky ""cover"" of 4 Hero's ""Mr. Kirk's Nightmare"", connecting the grotty hip-house of first-wave rave and the shamelessly cheesy bass wobble of current dubstep. If the recent noisy excesses of the Ed Bangers and Alter Egos of the world left a bad taste in your mouth, Shout at the DÃ¶ner is not for you. If you're old enough to need earplugs, but also lament dance music's 21st-century slide into gentility, here's a way to relive its dumb-ass glory days in the safety of your home.","Latest from Kid606 isÂ a hell of a lot of fun-- a rough, dirty party album, a trawl through two decades of abusive bass and dancefloor bad taste.

Tinted Windows,Tinted Windows,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d013d1975652138b8d/1:1/w_160/383b4421.jpg,2009-04-29 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12957-tinted-windows/,S-Curve,"Let's not proclaim the CD dead just yet. Just as there are certain types of music that sound better on vinyl, the clean-room sound of that nearly obsolete silvery disc is the perfect medium for certain styles mostly associated with the 90s alt-rock that coincides with the technology's heyday. It's not an across-the-board pairing, however. Pearl Jam were so into vinyl that they added scratches to Vitalogy. But Stone Temple Pilots: CD. Candlebox: CD. Hanson: CD. Fountains of Wayne: CD. The Smashing Pumpkins: CD (although I imagine they'd be particularly loathe to admit it). Those last three acts are all represented in the new group Tinted Windows. That's middle child Taylor Hanson on vocals. Former Pumpkin James Iha on guitar. Fountain Adam Schlesinger on bass. And on the skins! The one! The only! Bun! E.! Carlos! (Crowd goes same). The drummer is obviously the odd man out here: Not only is he old enough to be the singer's father, but Cheap Trick is old enough to have intimately influenced each of his bandmates, their former bands, and pretty much anyone they ever toured with. Also, Cheap Trick: both vinyl and CD. The result of this collaboration is the kind of polished power pop that was popular and even a little edgy for a brief period during the previous decade, and it's hard to tell if Tinted Windows, with their power chords, studio-sculpted guitars, and terrible name, are hopelessly dated and irrelevant or simply nostalgic for a musical moment before CDs became technology's bitch-- right above cassingles and right below eight-tracks. I was a little disappointed that my copy wasn't sealed with one of those dogbone stickers, the residue of which would remain long after the death of the medium and even the death of me. On the other hand, the second or third best-selling tween act in the country is a power-pop act-- Jonas Brothers-- who take to the genre like a birthright and who really aren't so bad, as far as that sort of thing goes. Is there a market for the style or just for young brother acts? Even if Tinted Windows are riding a revivalist wave, the group's self-titled debut is pretty unsurprising in its pop-rock format, and it may be cynical to think they've polished it up and sanded it down to make it as broadly appealing as possible. Songs open with a snappy riff; catchy choruses follow melodic verses; and the opposite sex is the main subject matter. ""Kind of a Girl"" is the first song on their new album, and arguably the best, showcasing Schlesinger's compact melodies and an interesting dynamic between his bass line and Iha's guitar squall. Spelling out each woah-woah in the lyrics sheet is a nice touch, and a reminder to say good-bye to liner notes. Unfortunately, those may be the wittiest lyrics in the song, whose title promises a character who's not entirely a girl, but just kind of a girl. Instead, Schlesinger, whose pop sensibility once seemed dead-on, writes like he's still on the That Thing You Do set. Tinted Windows is best when the tempo is fast and the momentum relentless, which makes ""Kind of a Girl"" a strong leadoff and ""Can't Get a Read on You"" almost desperately fast. The highlight of ""Messing with My Head""-- the real keeper here-- may be Hanson's performance, which showcases a cool falsetto yelp and subtle growl in his otherwise everyguy vocals.Â As the pace of the songs slow, the intensity flags and the album sags. The big, midtempo chords of ""Dead Serious"" herald a lackluster chorus, faux-breathless vocals, de rigueur guitar fanfares, and an egregiously unexcitable use of ""hey hey hey!"" Those are all Schlesinger compositions; Iha and Hanson fare worse in the songwriting department: the guitarist's ""Cha Cha"" is a grating Cheap Trick knock-off that should have given the drummer pause, and the singer's ""Nothing to Me"" grafts a pretty mean-spirited kiss-off to a pretty limp hook. But at least neither of them is responsible for the bass player's insipid montage rocker ""Without Love"", whose faux uplift is tempered with moldy pop clichÃ©s like ""Without love the nights are so long."" Sure, lyrics aren't as crucial as melody and momentum, but how can you sing along if you're always cringing? Ultimately, the whole of Tinted Windows is so much less than the sum of its considerable parts that it's almost tragic. In playing to pop's imagined past, this quartet neglect the idiosyncrasies that made them such compelling individual artists: the inventiveness of Iha's solo work, the humor and specificity of Fountains, the exuberance of ""Mmmbop"", the sweet escapism of Cheap Trick in the 70s. If there are dollar bins in the future, that's where you'll find this failed debut.","You know who's inside: James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins), Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Bun E. Carlos (Cheap Trick), and Taylor Hanson.
